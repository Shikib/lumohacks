_The_Multi-Verse_	I feel the exact same way... My parents just hurt me over and over again, and not in simple ways, shit like getting my girlfriend sent to foster care, or getting my best friend arrested for nothing...
_The_Multi-Verse_	Why is it so hard to be me? | I just sit back and wait for something to happen, but nothing ever does... Nothing ever happens, and nobody ever cares... It isn't going to change either...
hither22	Probably is too late, this subreddit is a practical ghost town.
hither22	Yeah, my plan is to go straight to Community College after High School. I really don't know, I never had an F in my high school years other than Freshmen, which was expected since colleges don't care about that. I don't know when I transfer to what college I'm going to. I'm in Sacramento, CA and have UCDavis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Animation Arts, Sac State. I have taken Biology and Earth Science. Currently in Chemistry and very unsure if I want to talk Physics next year. Since I don't what my major is going to be and what college. I only took pre-IB English last year, and now I tried to get into IB English but the school fucked me up. Idk if AP Government is hard and good for Senior year. https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/70ive6/the_school_fucked_me_up_big_time_how_do_i_cope/
hither22	True. Luckily support got you if you want it approved and it kept getting rejected lol. I remember when people were first making Crocodiles and Deers Mods approved a load of names XD.
hither22	Dang, that's pretty weird either that or if they're so busy, that may have been overwhelmed idk honestly but yeah seems like a possibility.
hither22	Planning to end it all by the school year if I mess up. | Starting to plan to end my life, if I mess up in my English Class. I already have an F and tried to find ways to relieve my stress. If it doesn't go as planned, then I need to end my life. I hate my English teacher he's crap, and expects me to complete 4 pages of notes in a few days. This is the best way I could force myself, no college if I mess up. An F is bad for my Junior year.
hither22	I've seen combined words that are longer than 15 letters. It truly is a mystery, OP hope you get your name approved.
hither22	You always love to start drama, just stop please. You trash talk all the time, and yet you bluff?
hither22	I like, happy for u and your gf btw lol. Seriously though, I love it hope you can make it to staff :)
hither22	His jokes were truly amazing, great guy. He recovered well from the hacking incident, I remember it was all over Toonbook when it wasn't killed off. Yee gag tries too hard, and never still understood why people suddenly kiss up to him and other streamers Smirky, and Loopy G were terrible in Altis caused a lot of controversy in the Steam Greenlit problem. They had those interesting rants, and I still laugh at the fact that bad gameplay still persists in TTR today. OMG Ikr, I try to avoid them too, hate getting crushed and tortured over an *arf ing* autograph. Yup, like in LA I live in California and can confirm what you've said is true. Wow, they should see all the Megasnoop clones? Honestly who gives a crap if they're copying Megasnoop or not. It's their choice, so why should they be concerned about you kind of thing. They're really ignorant on their part. Probably because they don't waste their time watching a streamer WHO does nothing other than play toontown. Sorry that we're not kiss ups to streamers. I find it how funny it is when the steamers (most of them not in high school) most are college students who know popularity doesn't matter there, yet try to get all crazy and act like it matters onine and became a**wipes about things. Yeah, Frizzy is pretty much dead and Lefty was ok in TTO. Now I hate him, but neutral on Frizzy. I met Master Milton once in a VP in TTO, I was 11 and was like "omg hi master milton i'm your biggest fan."(cringy agreed stupid kid)Someone, this dog I believe said "dude he doesn't care about you and who honestly cares."Kinda harsh saying that to me, I said one more word and then Master Milton responded. People were messaging me and bugging me once they saw I was on Royko64's stream a couple of years ago, "omg i saw you were on Ben's steam" i would've fainted so much and threw up' dude you're famous you're lucky to be on there"(don't care but okay then) Yah, MLK was fighting for what he believed in. You don't get respect, you earn it STEAMERS ugh can't stress that enough XD. Francine got what she deserved. It's not George's fault that he keeps getting a bloody nose, was encouraged to watch that episode after so long woot nostalgia. Karma got her well it seems, but yea not fair to the unpopular kid. We're all equally special in our own ways, can these streamers even realize that and stop acting like a special snowflake?
hither22	Yup, 4 months later he is still here :(
hither22	This is late, but true!
hither22	Nah, they brought back 32 bit support awhile ago. The OP should contact support just incase. Not everyone can afford 64 bit computers btw.
hither22	Nah, they brought back 32 bit support awhile ago. The OP should contact support just incase. Not everyone can afford 64 bit computers btw.
hither22	can confirm :)
hither22	Rip nope lol...
hither22	Yup, just the typical TTR XD. Seems legit.
hither22	Nice job, you're doing good on taking care of your body :).
hither22	I think it's a male from the US. Since he talked about the girl who loved that made him feel worthless. I'm feeling the same way about High School.
hither22	I'm not even sure, my mom hasn't told me about the doctor appointment yet.
hither22	It probably can. I'll do anything please.
hither22	I guess that means that's it's supposed to be a relaxation method, I could barely think.
hither22	I'm too scared and think it's stupid. I will probably kill myself by the end of this year if I can keep it up was my terrifying motive. I'm too fucking quiet who is called a "nuisance" to others, ironic how people complain about feel betrayed betray me. I want to fucking hit myself and he deleted me out of the spot and wanted to not "remind me." Yet later his friends harassed me online, cause online friend and he did not defend me. My dumbass self fell for this. I am stupid, I hate junior year it's too much. That guy deleted me off Discord, he used to be supportive. He always placed the blame on me and said "I was over thinking the problem and that i didn't promise jackshit." I cried and got sad, the first time he actually stood up for me. Idk what happened, I'm at a lost burden at this point.
hither22	How would I write that down? Idk, I guess it happens a lot. I also do it when I'm frustrated with people.
hither22	Anytime :D
hither22	I just have these excessive thoughts for some reason. How can I find hope? These thoughts are way over in my head.
hither22	Yeah, I also do that when I keep procrastinating and anxiety. I told my Mom this and she told me to "breathe, you're stronger than anxiety." She told me she doesn't know when's my next Doctor appointment is, i'm assuming she'll find out. 
hither22	Most of the time.
hither22	Same i get salty towards them. I can't stand them nowadays, and yeah man Joey got a lot of things going on already. All they do is play the game pretty much, and so can you idk whats so special about that. They act like they're freaking celebrities. TRTS I sort of liked him, although I do not watch him anymore. Missed the good ol days with Frizzy, Lefty, and Master Milton in 2012. Streamers can be rude sometimes, and Megasnoop is such a nuisance. Smirky is so desperate for donations and hogs his views. I once talked back to GagStrategists a year ago, and he has his minion called Mr. Barks Alot and he's annoying too. Gag shows no strategy, and generally a boring guy to listen to, people can be blinded and forget that they're people too.
hither22	I'm an idiot. | Anytime, I would always make a mistake like I did 3-4 years ago I would slap myself on the cheeks and then it gets slightly redish. I sometimes do it, but not often. If I do something foolish, and gets out of control then boom it happens like that. I'm 16 and a Junior in high school if that matters, hate how I look i'm ugly mofo who needs to learn things. 
hither22	Just wanted to say I'm sorry for what you're going through, and thank you for pming me means a lot :D. I feel ya, and please don't do it.
hither22	Thanks, I'll try to <3. Life can be so stressful sometimes for some reason.
hither22	You're right Breathing does help, even though it's hard for me never hurts to try it. I get a slight heartbeat rather than a full thanks to breathing. Yeah, I used the Internet for so long and I hate being stuck in drama. I really wish I could easily forget it about. I did bit my tongue and thought it was horrible. I admit at home I sometimes raise my voice at my brother and sister when they're talking, so I can get them to be quiet to watch my TV show. At school, I'm so opposite of that. I would always slap my cheeks and it gets slightly red because anytime I made a mistake when I was younger, sometimes I do that still.
hither22	I had a somewhat of a strong relationship, and I was manipulated by one of them even though he's 29, who acts like a mentally 12 year old because of internet age tests. It would creep me out and I got taken advantage, and thought things would change, so he then placed the blame on me and said"maybe this should be a lesson why you stop being pathetic and don't losing your friends." Phew, I hope not thank you so much. My voice sounds so low, when I talk because I'm so quiet and when people stare at me for a bit, it tends to make me feel uncomfortable.  I would always slap my cheeks and it gets slightly red because anytime I did a foolish mistake when I was younger, sometimes I do that but not often.
hither22	I need help please, I'm all stressed out? | Hiya, I'm a Junior in High school who has social problems, so I suffer from severe shyness,and social anxiety due to me being introverted. Even when I get picked on/ also in class and I still talk my body still feels so shaky, and I fucked up in Piano Class I was trying to play Rock Along. My hands were full of sweat 2 days ago and it was noticeable that my voice was shaking. The teacher tried to help me and I want to play it right. Mexican Hat Dance I can do okay. All these things are still somehow bothering me. I really do not want to go to my family's party at 2pm just because my Dad went to hajj(i'm not religious but still respect I guess). Anytime, I raise my hand my heart beats so when the teacher isn't looking I quickly put it back down. I'm too shy to ask for help and embarrassed by this. Same for my Math class, my mom was right "If you have questions, then ask the teacher and don't come home clueless about the math HW." There's tutoring, and is it worth it? I used to be in this community forum. I feel so bad for harassing someone on there, but they won't forgive me. Then, I see my ex-online friend with my other ex-online friend becoming friends again and it disgusts me. It may be "their choice" but how do i stop this? I respect that it's bad and all, they done bad things too I'm for certain. This game I played as Toontown Online a child, the revival of the game Toontown Rewritten I've gotten my toon terminated due from the past because I was a foolish Freshmen at the time. I tried to send them an appeal explaining the situation, how if you keep mentioning the past and how else are you going to expect them to change? I still can't get over from that game, and get mentioned and still go on these forums for it. My addiction is uncanny and can't stop.  I keep constantly stressing myself out and procrastinating a lot.  
hither22	My guess is that those are the main ones currently, but yeah there's some more like Sperry, and Frizzy OMG I actually want to hear the feedback of him xddd.
hither22	I hope I can do this, thank you :D. I will indeed so too. Hopefully this problem won't be long-term.
hither22	Surprised that you weren't on there. A good amount of people watch you dude. Yeah you got a fair point though, if this was on Discord then it could have some more interesting feedback but what's done is done.
hither22	truth.
hither22	I feel empty and blinded by my past (long post). | Hello I'm a Junior in high school who has social problems, so I suffer from severe shyness,and social anxiety due to me being introverted. Even when I get picked on/ also in class and I still talk my body still feels so shaky, and I fucked up in Piano Class I was trying to play Rock Along. My hands were full of sweat yesterday and it was noticeable that my voice was shaking. Anytime, I raise my hand my heart beats so when the teacher isn't looking I put it down. I'm too shy to ask for help and embarrassed by this. Same for my Math class, my mom was right "If you have questions, then ask the teacher and don't come home clueless about the math HW." I suffer from a bad past. I got bullied in middle school and 5th and 6th grade for having dandruff. In middle school I told through counselor and she just gave the bully, what you may ask was the consequence? Only 2 lunch detentions and ironically that counselor was bullying me about "(My name) if you have bad grades, i'm going to call your parents." Then, I told her that it was not right embarrassing me in front of my friends. She started crying and saying "I'm sry." I gave her a 2nd chance and she refused to change my classes and said go talk to the principal :/. I literally even avoided to swear at her and that was attempting. I hope I never run into that bad counselor Ms. Dukes ever again. I'm so glad I left that school to high school, that bullying is not much a problem to me compared to in middle school. Also, my 8th grade English teacher humiliated me and saying that "You have an F in my class. Gotta fix that F." I mean, I understand that I have a bad grade, but doesn't mean you can freaking embarrass me in front of the class. Then, I told the principal and he said he "was sry." The next week, he said the N word and then said "(my name) Hope this doesn't offend you, don't call your parents." He laughed like a complete idiot and don't understand why he hasn't been divorced yet. Someone in 6th grade asked me about this word and then I answered it in the way that it means. Then, he proceeds to say "Eww, gross." He spreads the rumor about me in my class, and in this program W.I.N we have every morning, my friends won't sit by me anymore and I literally cried. The principal assigned lunch seats and I just sat there quietly and was a loner. This boy was bothering me in the lunch line, luckily I got him to back off since a teacher was there. He almost beat me up in the bathroom but I defended myself and fell, but I was okay. He ran away like a coward. After winter break, I started to be cool with them and told them not to believe that kind of stuff. I will never miss elementary school and middle school. I don't know how to find the scale factor of 2 shapes.  I can't fucking take it anymore, and when I was younger, I would always slap myself on the side of my cheeks for being an idiot. Sometimes, I still do. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my head.I'm selfish I care what others think of me.In 6th grade, someone choked me and couldn't almost breathe for a minute was painful. I spilled soap on my sister's face because I'm a fucking idiot who does bad stuff and the wrong thing.. Then, I couldn't breathe again for a bit. I feel like i talk about myself too much and just am stupid. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not there at a place and just zone out for some reason. Why bother to feel live if there's not much hope? I keep stressing myself out and procrastinating a lot. I always had a thought of torturing myself with a pillow.
hither22	Oh lord, I never had this much of a issue that serious before. What should I say to explain to them, about my anxiety and stress? I would always slap myself on the cheeks, get slighty red anytime I said or did something wrong when I was younger, don't do it that often anymore but still happens.
hither22	Yeah, it would've gotten more responses then. I was thinking about that too.
hither22	Ugh man, I'll ever understand the approval system. One of my friends got "Undeer Review" rejected 3 times in a row, and then the next time it finally got approved lol.
hither22	Ditto.
hither22	Ikr?
hither22	Ikr, that would be so silly.
hither22	Lool true! He has to have some of it left to abuse.
hither22	A literal meme. LOL I remember that, love how he suddenly crawled up.
hither22	True, I still am trying to talk to staff if they'll even bother to listen/ reply/
hither22	Now that is *terrifying*
hither22	Ikr, they really gotta tone down that bitch. Crocodiles is meh, but somewhat better than the Deer's voice although it's congested sounding like a grandpa clearing his throat. If they fix it to where it won't sound like a squeaky old lady, that'd be nice.
hither22	it sounds like eyoooooo eyoooo, hate it as well
hither22	^ This
hither22	Welp I still got banned for ban evasion trying to log on.
hither22	3 weeks later, and it's confirmed that my accounts are blocked: still VPN and still banned for ban evasion :/ 
hither22	Lol I almost forgot about this post. That's weird, they usually give out warnings / or some infractions that lead up to it. Yeah, if they had the skip button that would be nice. They should consider that honestly, and i'm in the same boat as you. 
hither22	Lmk
hither22	I don't remember saying that stuff, where did I say that?
hither22	One of the mods Mr. Mango was thinking about improving safety, and now idk what happened to the idea of that. It's a good one, and if they do that, it should probably be best if that was added. Ikr, it should stay but with better imrpovements.
hither22	Nice! Hopefully they'll listen.
hither22	They said the same thing to me XD, but that's a good site to post since the TTR staff are on there.
hither22	Yeah, I hope so too. Hopefully that'll happen :D
hither22	I get what you're saying, but they're refusing to listen to what the community wants for True Friends. It was a good option of not dealing with other players and so you can go chatless.
hither22	They should've done that honestly.
hither22	Yeah, parents will always find a way to complain. Maybe a suitable age? Just having the idea of maybe certain restrictions and a balance of limits could maybe do it. 
hither22	Alright, thanks.
hither22	Yeah. They should get the consequences for lying, and they want to stay true to the original so it should stay.
hither22	Well, then that's why it should have an age limit even though most aren't kids.
hither22	YOU POSTED AN OPINION I DON'T LIKE I'M GONNA SHUT YOU DOWN SINCE I'M ONE OF OTAKU'S useless underlings that follows what he says!!1!#@@!!and CENSOR EVERYTHING@@@@@@!!!!!!!3E44E DOWNVOTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111 /S
hither22	That is awesome and that name rhymes!
hither22	It's going to look so different without the TF button, they should really just have an age limit for it.
hither22	Otaku went away and wanted people to forget how pathetic he was that destroyed this subreddit. Mysteryman should've stayed the owner, so Otaku's underlings won't ruin the place like they are right now shutting people down they need to let people discuss matters of controversy. The Mod-driven drama drastically changed this subreddit, and I advise you all to just go to /r/toontownrewritten and switch over there instead, this place will never recover from what it was. Everyone who commented is right, Otaku is crap, and it's sad that this place will never be the same as it was. Otaku caused the TTR staff to get rid of support here. Apex is practically a literal meme, most likely quit on that.
hither22	He was unleashed to be a coward and ran away like the pathetic person he was. I always loved how he talked smack about other servers, but really ikr tbh it was a Meme, and yeah probably did.
hither22	Apparently it got removed and I can't access and look through when hitting her account. Welp, for once I may actually deserve that but overall in the past, you guys have been shutting people down and don't let them discuss matters of controversy. 
hither22	Lol me too for real though, I got a day suspension cuz of that. You've committed a sin, oh no controversy! Banned!1111sss /s. My friend Devon and Rocco knows her sadly.
hither22	yep
hither22	Very true.
hither22	Whoa, that looks really nice!
hither22	Spoken by the admin of /r/Censorshipsucks. It's amazing how he hasn't gotten anything yet for swearing vulgarly at me.  You're biased yourself you like to cherry pick things, of the termination you took and assumed something was wrong without hearing the other side of the story. We're taking OP's word for it and I do believe her: https://www.reddit.com/r/Toontown/comments/6n34m0/one_termination_global_termination_merciless_staff/. It's amazing how you let the same person who also harassed /u/vanillaraindeer get away with things like these. https://imgur.com/a/a3TnU
hither22	I'm surprised that his minions are still here, cough SharpSensePlays they should run away too.
hither22	yes
hither22	Yeah, i'm glad that's not happening.
hither22	This ^ , especially when he last posted on other subreddits not too long ago. Having fun shutting people down SharpSensePlays?
hither22	Haha ikr it would be, that could be a possibility though, who knows.
hither22	Haha ikr it would be, that could be a possibility though, who knows.
hither22	Yeah. I think he means that one.
hither22	100 for me too, 115 if possible free time lol.
hither22	I love this!
hither22	Oh wow that's actually really good, forgot the TTR staff also abandoned it, which made this subreddit a ghosttown with not many posts frequently and wasn't just about memes(although some of them I do like and are funny/relevant). MysteryMan was awesome, and also Otaku kicked TRD out and locked the subreddit, and it was completely stupid. Edit:we need to PM LOL
hither22	Yeah mods like Sharp, Nat one of otakus underlings practically drove people away from this subreddit and knowing that they're on the tt discord is bad, I bet she knows what shes did which is why she cowardly moves to the TTR one. She shuts people down and lets Otakus trigger happy of events get on here. And you've been on here since 2015? Was it good? Seems to be the best year on the forums and in-game.
hither22	I'm going to try for this too! That's nice of them to give some type of reward for 50 laff, but i'm going to aim for 100 or 115 laff. Good luck guys!
hither22	Awesome, idk if you saw this with this guy having all good suggestions. https://ttrforums.com/threads/new-toontown-features-ideas-with-pictures.12956/
hither22	Ah okay, yeah I searched it and realized it myself thanks. Whoever approved Hare Owen I don't understand, yeah hopefully no lol.
hither22	It doesn't seem like that, and King Roscue still persists there. I'm not trying to sound rude, but really less than 3% are kids. It's a good idea to keep it family-friendly yes, but have words like Blaze, whitelisted. This filter needs improvement honestly, why are you allowed to say words like diabetes and "aww tt is um" as those are serious problems. people in Vibrant think it's funny to make fun of people for disabilities. I have one and needed to say this, sorry it was off-topic. I don't know what else to say, only way I can play is weekends.
hither22	New toon species! :)
hither22	Thanks for the hard work, this hype is real. Will you guys allow the ability to choose your district before you log in? 
hither22	If people feel uncomfortable with their friends saying inappropriate stuff, then they can just remove them so they won't say. What ever happened to Mr Mango saying about his vote to saying to fix it? Could be dangerous yes, but realistically look at the stuff said in Vibrant as that's not dangerous apparently, well it is. It does NOT need to be moderated many players are old enough to know what to do in situations that make them uncomfortable. 
hither22	I mean names like Hare Owen was approved - Heroine a drug, but thankfully got revoked. You can even know it just saying that, it's bad. There are toons named that, just curious how is it against the rules? Does it reference to something bad?
hither22	No, it's good that they still have that. It could connect the players from TLPO to TTR as that would be nice. It could potentially still have its use, the idea if having age limits on True Friends is nice. Look, majority of the community wants it and TTR says it wants community feedback on stuff.
hither22	Yeah, I thought TTR wants community feedback on these things. So they can realize what we want, you can help strive for them reconsidering this.
hither22	Didn't you say you hated True Friends? Not trying to sound rude, but how is that relevant to the topic of this thread?
TrainerAbu	Dude I can't live | I need help!! I wish I had people to talk to.  It's all over.  Three months ago (probably longer now) I lost my friend (because my friend that makes all my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead got her to hate me completely, I already have him blocked and know he's a toxic friend now) and now I miss my friend (not the toxic friend but the other one)  and I go to her tumblr page and she .. I like the same things she likes... but I tried to talk to her again yesterday, and she blocked me.. Her tumblr has all this stuff about anime and cartoons and games that I like, and I think we'd be good friends.. We were good friends for two years on tumblr (and 11 years before that, although I didn't see her for ten of them) before my friend made her dislike me..  And my mom says I'm not allowed to get a 12-pack for three weeks because I stole a little bit of my dad's scotch a couple days ago.  And now I don't know how to deal with all of these little annoyances. I woke up, and I heard my mom's breathing machine and it sounds so annoying and I can't sleep like that either and I just wanted to do something horrible. But then I realize, they'll probably ban me from alcohol even longer. My dad's coming home soon. I wanna explode and say that I really want beer tomorrow even though I stole his scotch the other day. But they say that's the only punishment I can have.  And I got up and went to the bathroom and again my mom ran to the downstairs bathroom and tried talking to me from the downstairs bathroom. So I went on the computer, and a bug landed on my screen. And both of my internet routers (I don't know why we have two, every time I bring it up my dad acts like I'm crazy and then says he doesn't realize we even had two routers) keep not working out good so my internet keeps dieing and I keep having to unplug and replug both of my routers constantly,  and I keep venting over and over on Tumblr again about how I miss my friend that my friend made dislike me, but no one is interacting with me. And I can't stand my mom harassing me and stuff. She says even though I'm 30 years old, I can't buy new pants with my money to replace the dorky pants I have that always make me too hot, because she bought me these pants when I was in school and she doesn't want me to replace them. Everyone says my mom always babies me. She's going to die soon, though. She's on a breathing machine and stuff.  I can't live. I feel bad that I lost my friend. She keeps posting stuff on her Tumblr that I relate to too.. I was always her friend until my best friend that always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead, made her not like me.. Same with my crush that always says I'm "hers" (she says "mine") and if I ever block her, she posts on her facebook "Let's dig up some dirt on [me]" or she says "My sisters say you're like Chris-chan, but I don't know" then she'll block me if she's mad at me (I looked it up and saw she was trying to insult me for having aspberger's I guess)  and right now I just hear the downstairs TV and I can't make out the words it just sounds so annoying!  And my dad's gonna come home and drink scotch soon and watch TV. I really wish I had beer on friday, at least next week.  And I feel really bad that I can't get my friend to see me who I am and my existence is being denied.  And I keep posting on Tumblr but no one's talking to me on there. And I can't stand my mom always harassing me. And I really miss my friend ;___; ok I already said that..  I actually was not supposed to message my friend because she said a lot that she'll get me into trouble if I do and that she considers it harassment if I message her again, but I keep trying to tell her that my friend was wrong about me, I literally don't even know why she stopped talking to me, she doesn't want to communicate with me.. But I keep messaging her, even though her friend told me that her dad is a cop and she'll get me into trouble if I talk to her again, because now that I can't drink beer for three weeks, I literally can not deal with all the annoyances that happen every day throughout the week, and I figure its ok if I keep messaging this girl cuz my life is completely over anyways and I wish I could show her that I'm not a bad person, although I admit its bad to disrespect her wishes and message her when she told me not to, but I'm not even sure why, other than that my best friend convinced her to not like me anymore because "all I do is make crappy Hamtaro fangames" and stuff aah  I just woke up from hearing my mom's breathing machine, I can hear it in my room when I'm laying down and I can't think to myself in bed anymore =(
TrainerAbu	Clinging to her | I lost my friend (my friend that for 15 years has always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead, convinced her not to like me.  He's not my friend anymore.)  I don't know what to do.  She wouldn't add me on Discord, so I sent her like 300+ messages a day on Twitter asking her why.  I asked my friend (the one that randomly messaged me out of nowhere saying "hey remember your ex-girlfriend?  I added her and told her that all you do is smoke 420 and drink beer and she's pretty disappointed in you") and well its a long story.  I noted that I didn't know they were friends with eachother, since on her outgoing discord friend request, on her profile under mutual friends, it says they are.  But my friend kept saying that's "super shady shit" and I explained to him that I literally found out by looking at their discord profile and he said "Yeah right, you did super shady shit to find that out, I'm telling her" and he said all I do is make crappy Hamtaro fangames so I don't deserve to be friends with her (all he does is link me to furry porn that I don't click on at all but I compliment it anyways so that he doesn't get mad, and he links me to pictures of her and calls her "hawt" and he makes sexual jokes about her to me all the time and it makes me mad, and he always says stuff like "Your girls are wacky abu, they don't message me that much" and he calls calling them "my girls" and I hate that he doesn't just refer to them by name, anyways he told her that I sexualized her and convinced her into thinking that I'm some kind of creepy stalker rapist which isn't true,  and now I can't live on!!  Her tumblr...  She keeps posting stuff that's a lot like me..  I like the same stuff she likes..  She just posted pictures of Mako and Ryuko from Kill la Kill, and I had a picture of those two as my Steam avatar once..  and all kinds of stuff like that..  and it really hurts that her tumblr says stuff like "    I hope something good happens to you today. no matter how small or simple it may seem to someone else, I hope something contents you from the bottom of your heart and makes your worries feel lighter" with #for you! but yet I'm not allowed to talk to her, so I guess those nice words apply to everyone in this universe except for me ;-;  I really miss her.  Her friend keeps watching my tumblr and if I vaguely mention her at all, her friend replies with "delete this."  I'm not sure where to even vent about this anymore.  When I was a kid, I was clingy to my neighbor, and he had a talk with me and said that he didn't want to talk to me anymore.  Anyways, I just want to die without her being my friend.
TrainerAbu	Dude I can't live | I need help!!  I wish I had people to talk to.  It's all over.  Three months ago (probably longer now) I lost my friend (because my friend that makes all my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead got her to hate me completely, I already have him blocked and know he's a toxic friend now) and now I miss my friend (not the toxic friend but the other one)  and I go to her tumblr page and she .. I like the same things she likes...  but I tried to talk to her again yesterday, and she blocked me..  Her tumblr has all this stuff about anime and cartoons and games that I like, and I think we'd be good friends..  We were good friends for two years on tumblr (and 11 years before that, although I didn't see her for ten of them) before my friend made her dislike me..  And my mom says I'm not allowed to get a 12-pack for three weeks because I stole a little bit of my dad's scotch a couple days ago.  And now I don't know how to deal with all of these little annoyances.  I woke up, and I heard my mom's breathing machine and it sounds so annoying and I can't sleep like that either and I just wanted to do something horrible.  But then I realize, they'll probably ban me from alcohol even longer.  My dad's coming home soon.  I wanna explode and say that I really want beer tomorrow even though I stole his scotch the other day.  But they say that's the only punishment I can have.  And I got up and went to the bathroom and again my mom ran to the downstairs bathroom and tried talking to me from the downstairs bathroom.  So I went on the computer, and a bug landed on my screen.  And both of my internet routers (I don't know why we have two, every time I bring it up my dad acts like I'm crazy and then says he doesn't realize we even had two routers) keep not working out good so my internet keeps dieing and I keep having to unplug and replug both of my routers constantly,  and I keep venting over and over on Tumblr again about how I miss my friend that my friend made dislike me, but no one is interacting with me.  And I can't stand my mom harassing me and stuff.  She says even though I'm 30 years old, I can't buy new pants with my money to replace the dorky pants I have that always make me too hot, because she bought me these pants when I was in school and she doesn't want me to replace them.  Everyone says my mom always babies me.  She's going to die soon, though.  She's on a breathing machine and stuff.  I can't live.  I feel bad that I lost my friend.  She keeps posting stuff on her Tumblr that I relate to too..  I was always her friend until my best friend that always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead, made her not like me..  Same with my crush that always says I'm "hers" (she says "mine") and if I ever block her, she posts on her facebook "Let's dig up some dirt on [me]" or she says "My sisters say you're like Chris-chan, but I don't know" then she'll block me if she's mad at me (I looked it up and saw she was trying to insult me for having aspberger's I guess)  and right now I just hear the downstairs TV and I can't make out the words it just sounds so annoying!  And my dad's gonna come home and drink scotch soon and watch TV.  I really wish I had beer on friday, at least next week.  And I feel really bad that I can't get my friend to see me who I am and my existence is being denied.  And I keep posting on Tumblr but no one's talking to me on there. And I can't stand my mom always harassing me. And I really miss my friend ;___; ok I already said that..  I actually was not supposed to message my friend because she said a lot that she'll get me into trouble if I do and that she considers it harassment if I message her again, but I keep trying to tell her that my friend was wrong about me, I literally don't even know why she stopped talking to me, she doesn't want to communicate with me..  But I keep messaging her, even though her friend told me that her dad is a cop and she'll get me into trouble if I talk to her again, because now that I can't drink beer for three weeks, I literally can not deal with all the annoyances that happen every day throughout the week, and I figure its ok if I keep messaging this girl cuz my life is completely over anyways and I wish I could show her that I'm not a bad person, although I admit its bad to disrespect her wishes and message her when she told me not to, but I'm not even sure why, other than that my best friend convinced her to not like me anymore because "all I do is make crappy Hamtaro fangames" and stuff aah
TrainerAbu	and I really miss my friend ;_____; heeelpp
TrainerAbu	my mom keeps scraping stuff on the bowl I just want to punch her in the face aaah she said "Ohh poor baby" about the beer too and oiwjrw
TrainerAbu	and her tumblr posts say things like "I hope something good happens to you today. no matter how small or simple it may seem to someone else, I hope something contents you from the bottom of your heart and makes your worries feel lighter" with hashtag "For you!" and "lin" (someone please tell me what lin means) but now I see it's not for me, its for everyone besides me, cuz she doesn't like me anymore..  I feel really bad... Why does everyone else deserve to be told nice things like that, but not me..?  ;_;
TrainerAbu	I literally can't stand it anymore | I'm like killing myself now in all kinds of ways I mean um.  I don't know what to do  I was depressed ever since I lost some friends a few months ago, and  Everything is so annoying here!!  I can hear the TV from downstairs up here!!  And I can hear my mom's breathing machine so I can't sleep!  I stole my dad's scotch and had a little bit of it, and now I'm not allowed to drink beer for three weeks.  Usually I get twelve pack on fridays.  I can't deal with all of these little annoyances anymore, now that I don't have beer at the end of the week  ;___;
TrainerAbu	30
TrainerAbu	Ahhhhh I don't know how to deal with all the annoyances throughout the day now that I don't have beer on the weekend
TrainerAbu	I don't know how to cope with this | I took some of my dad's scotch yesterday, and I got in trouble and I'm not allowed to drink for three weeks.  My dad took me to the store and used my food stamps to pay for the groceries again and had me use my card to pay for over a hundred dollars of it.  And now he's drinking scotch and making jokes and acting relaxed and stuff.  I wish I had beer for the fun friday server I play on friday and the Toonami marathon on Saturday and stuff. =(
TrainerAbu	I'm too aspergery to live | I don't know what to do  actually nevermind I rambled about it on my tumblr and yet again no one interacted with me or my post and I just ended up deleting it  the team fortress 2 server I play on friday and saturday that has my friends in it, where they play anime and video game music, they call me Autism-kun instead of Abu kun when I join, and now yesterday and today they said that "Abu has a robo brain that is held together by faulty med gel" and I'm not sure what that means but I think it means they're saying I'm dumb.  I asked for help on discord and said I felt bad when my bro told me when I was a kid "There's something wrong with your brain" but then they all said "as an outsider, yes it does look like there's mental issues with you and your brain isn't normal."  I keep asking for help on reddit, but I get replies saying "Use your good boy points to buy chicken teddies." when I ask for advice.  What does that even mean??  The other replies were people saying they thought I was a troll, and I say I'm not a troll, and they say that just proves I am one (everyone new that I talk to on Steam etc. always thinks I'm a troll when I first talk to them, too.  and now my mom keeps slamming things downstairs which is something I complain about.  I even went downstairs and she said "What is it too noisy for ya???" before I said anything, and I said yeah and went back upstairs, at 6pm when I firs got up, and its 11pm and my mom is STILL SLAMMING all the cupboards and everything as the droors slam against the wood loudly bouncing against it and stuff, and now she keeps coughing because she's going to die soon and that's another reason why I don't want to move out like some people suggest and  I REALLY MISS my sensei um I made a huge post about it on my tumblr again and deleted it again after spending an hour typing it cuz no one interacted with my post umm I don't feel like explaining the horrible thing that made me depressed umm but I want to but I'm tired out by talking about it all the time  my friend that makes all my friends and - ACTUALLY someTIMEs when I POST ON reddit they say my post is "too long and chatty so I will admit I never read anything you wrote" so I won't even write more at this point aah
TrainerAbu	How do I get more of a following? | I have a tumblr for my Hamtaro fangame.  I keep following 300 hamtaro blogs and liking some of their posts, but only two follow me back and sometimes people message me asking if I'm a spam blog.  I also vent there sometimes about how I'm very depressed and really want an online friend and I'm lonely.  I don't know how to get followers on my Tumblr about my game development mainly aaah https://hamsterrivals.tumblr.com/
TrainerAbu	Gaaaaaaaah!  I want to be friends with my sensei.  I don't know where to vent.  They don't reply to me that often on the suicide forum I go to sometimes.
TrainerAbu	How to make a game like Mystic Messenger? | I'm a huge newbie to Unity.  But, I have been taking lessons on Udemy and I know a bit now.  Does anyone have advice on how to make a game like Mystic Messenger in Unity?  I mean a maiden game, where you can chat/interact with a bunch of NPCs?  Like can you push me in the right direction?
TrainerAbu	This morning when I noticed a second person ask about the game, I told them it was the one I was posting about before and linked them to my earlier posts that explains it better
TrainerAbu	Dissecting the combat in Secret of Mana & Seiken Densetsu 3 | Hello.  What do you think of the battle engine in Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3?  What works, what doesn't, and why?  I made a mmorpg fangame that I've been updating for 15 years, but the battle system kinda sucks (except for the stats and such!)  I remember that playing Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as a kid was always a blast!  So I was planning on hiring someone to make a Secret of Mana/Seiken Densetsu 3 battle engine (not the magic system, just the melee) for my next MMORPG (one that's based on an original IP of mine, and I'm bringing it to Steam.)  But I just wanted to have a discussion on the battle system first.
TrainerAbu	How do you get followers? | [removed]
TrainerAbu	Nice.  I'm not sure how to get interest on other platforms like Twitter and Twitch, though.
TrainerAbu	Every time I talk to people they think I'm a troll :x  and then when I say I'm not it just makes people think I am more
TrainerAbu	What do I do!? | I got depressed three months ago when my best friend that says he uses me and has always made my friends and girlfriends hate me and like him instead, for the 15 years I've known him, made my sensei and my crush both hate me, and then he blocked me.  ?? How do I get a following and friends and stuff?  Every day I keep posting on tumblr and twitter a lot, saying that I'm lonely and want help and I really just want a friend to talk to.  But I'm not really making any new friends.  I got a webcam yesterday.  I tried livestreaming Sonic Mania for a Zone, and I got no viewers.  I should probably just return the webcam, I don't know how to get people to watch my livestreams.  I posted something interesting on Tumblr, and it only got 8 likes, and I noticed that they're all loyal followers that liked it.  Now I keep deleting my new tumblr posts because I feel bad when no one likes them.  How do I get friends and followers online?  My family always bothers me.  Right now they did something to bother me.  But its always weird things.  I joined a random Discord server and mentioned it, and all that happened was one guy kept saying that he thinks there's "something wrong with my brain" over and over again.  How do I get friends and followers?  Also, where's a good place to vent when my family bothers me?  I hate that I'm 30 years old, and yet my mom says I'm "not allowed to move out" and I can't use my own money to replace the dorky pants I wear because she "bought me them when I was in middle school and she doesn't want me to replace them" and I'm not allowed to get a 12-pack tomorrow because she says I'm an alcoholic for getting a 12-pack on Friday's usually and aaah stuff
TrainerAbu	How do I get more of a following? | Hello.  I made an online Hamtaro chat game on BYOND.  It used to have 58 people playing it all at once, often, in year 2002.  Probably because BYOND was more popular then.  But now, barely anyone plays it.  I keep posting about it on my tumblr, but its hard to get people to care about my posts.  I keep following 300 people and liking their posts, but then only two people follow me back and some people message me asking if I'm a "spam blog."  I'm also making an original ip called Hamster Rivals, and I'm working on a few projects, including Hamster Rivals Hangout, which is a fun social mmorpg game that I'm working on bringing to Steam.  I was hoping it'd be kind of a community project, and that I'd have lots of character designers and stuff.  So far, no one's really helped out, though.  Except for one person that tried to design a hamster for the game.  I got very depressed three months ago when a toxic friend made my two other friends not like me, and now I'm alone.  I'm not sure how to find friends online or offline.  ok well anyways. How do I get more people to play my Hamtaro game?  I posted about it on Amino, and every time I do, lots of people are interested and ask me how to play it.  But I'm too lazy to tell them how because Amino is a mobile app and I hate typing a lot on touch screens.  I wish people on Tumblr saw my game like the people on the game development amino do.  I'm not sure how to get people to care about my Tumblr posts.  I keep posting screenshots of projects I'm working on, and then deleting them an hour later because I see that no one likes them.  I also keep posting a lot on my tumblr and twitter "OMG PLS HELP ME I'm so depressed I just want to kill myself literally, someone please be my friend, I'm so lonely" and then deleting it later, but no one ever talks to me.  I have so little followers on Tumblr and Twitter and I wish I knew how to get more of a following.  I make sure to absolutely never interact or talk with anyone ever, because I'm very shy.  I hope that strangers will message me and like my posts.  But yeah.  How do I get a following?  I suck at talking and explaining.  I mean when I post stuff on Tumblr, no one cares usually.  And I'm not sure how to get people interested in both Ham Ham Rivals and Hamster Rivals.  (Ham Ham Rivals is my hamtaro mmorpg that I've been updating for 15 years and still am, and Hamster Rivals is an original IP of mine.  I still need someone to design all of the characters for me, though.)  ok I'm really bad at talking but I think I said what I wanted to say.  I've been up from 4am to now at 7am just sitting at the computer wanting to work on something or interact with anyone.  In the year 2002, people gave me ideas for Ham Ham Rivals Chat, and I put them in the game.  Now, I keep BEGGING for two years literally on Tumblr and Twitter for anyone to please give me any idea at all for my Hamtaro chat fangame, and no one responds or likes my posts or anything, so I've just been doing bugfixes.  The two people that have played my game within the past year, from the game development Amino, really like it and they keep saying that they want to play it and play it with more people.  But, I'm not sure how to get people to notice anything I post or do.
TrainerAbu	How do I enable electrolysis and change process count? | Hello.  How do I do the stuff that the reply here is talking about?  https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfox/comments/6whixh/sluggishlaggy/
TrainerAbu	How do you play Superhot VR and Gorn?? | My friend bought a copy and gave it to me, and both times that I booted it up (with my brother around me watching,) well..  First of all gorn didn't seem to work at all.  I was tiny and I kept throwing punches but they weren't doing anything.  My bro told me to turn it off because it wasn't working and it was just weird.  So I tried Superhot VR for the second time and had the same problem as the first time I tried it.  I'm in this super tiny cramped space and the enemies are like 12 feet away and  I just keep moving my touch controllers around and around like a circle???  because that's the only way I can get the enemies to move and come after me.  My bro kept laughing and saying I look like an idiot.  halp
TrainerAbu	I can't stand hearing my mom slam cupboards and stuff she KEEPS DOING IT TODAY For like an hour and a half now and still doing it aaaaaa and it'd be weird being on a computer without hearing noise probably (I mean if I were try earplugs) aaa
TrainerAbu	I don't know how to do that :x
TrainerAbu	Oh.  Thanks.  Now that I fed some giant slimes and got some slime keys, I'm better now.  Although I get lost sometimes.
TrainerAbu	I'm bored. What do I do now? | My main land with the home and stuff has a coral or whatever its called with the cat-fused-with-pink slime blobs, and another coral with rock slimes.  And then the rest of the plots are gardens.  The overgrowth or whatever its called, I filled with gardens, roosters, and chickadoos.  The grove or whatever, I put the light-up-slimes in a coral, and the other 4 plots are gardens.  and now I'm bored.  What's the point of exploring if I already have the fruits and most of the slimes?  And what are slime keys and the doors and the teleporter pods?  I want to look it up, but I just had like 10 games spoiled to me while reading about them on NeoGAF recently, and I'm worried that I'll run into spoilers, or something that tells me exactly what I'm supposed to do.  Can someone give me a hint on what I'm supposed to do next, and what slime keys and those round doors are, and what you do with the giant slimes?  I bought all the gun upgrades in case it opens up more areas with more slimes, but I'm still in the start with pink slime things, rock slime things, cat slimes, lucky slimes, gold slimes, gar slimes, and red-eye-attackey slimes, and there's not even a point for me to explore this area over and over again because I already have all the slimes and fruit (besides the attacking slimes and the gold and lucky ones) in the starting area
TrainerAbu	it sounds uncomfy to lay on a pillow with headphones on though.  I don't have enough ear plug experiences, but I remember trying them when I was a little kid like one time and they wouldn't fit my ear and were uncomfy, so I ignored my mom when she suggests that I use ear plugs.  I guess I'll give it a try.  But I don't think it will be comfy enough for me.
TrainerAbu	Oh.  Yes!  When my brother moved back in, I mentioned the whistle thing, and he said "I won't...whistle..or whatever..." but he whistles every single day.  I assume he remembers me saying that, but ignored it because he thought I was "being weird again" and/or that "I would forget I ever said that cuz I was just being weird at the time" or something.  My bro always says I'm "being weird."  I didn't know I was messed up until I was a kid, when he sat next to me and kept telling me "there's something wrong with my brain"
TrainerAbu	The noise bothers me | I was depressed and didn't get out of bed until 9:30pm.  Well now I'm upstairs in the computer room, and my god I can't stand the noise of the downstairs living room TV up here.  I opened the door and its not the loud, and I'm sure my mom will be mad if I ask her to turn it down, because it doesn't seem that loud.  And then I think "wow it really isn't that loud, that makes no sense, it has to be quiet if I close the door" and I close it and I still hear it aaa for the past 40 minutes now aaa.  And my 35 year old brother moved back into my parents house with me, and he kicked me out of my old bedroom.  Now I sleep downstairs, and I can constantly hear my mom's breathing machine (she needs one, she's very sick and may die soon) going "Psssh.......Pssssh........PSSsssssh.....!!" over and over again, and it makes it harder to meditate and think about things like I used to do all night.  I have the air conditioner on and have stuff wrapped around me and I still hear my mom's breathing machine in the wallway making those noises.  And in the morning, I can hear my brother whistling (even though he told me not to snap my fingers cuz it will wake people up) and it wakes me up early every time, and I can hear everyone talking in the kitchen, all from my bedroom when I'm laying down with pillows and blanket over my head.  I can't stand always hearing all of this noise.  I want to draw, but its hard to when I hear the living room TV in the background and I can hear my mom slamming cupboards and stuff downstairs.  Edit: gosh dang and she really is slamming cupboards downstairs too.  She never listens to the advice I give her or stuff I ask her not to do.  Why is she SLAMMING the cupboards downstairs and I can literally hear the cupboard doors bounce hard on the freaking cupboards.  I'm a game developer and I want to animate stuff too and its hard to work on stuff when I hear this noise.  And now I LITERALLY HEAR a cup being put down on a table or something else.  And I'm upstairs!  Good thing the kitchen fan isn't on, that sounds extremely annoying up here.  my mom KEEPS MAKING NOISE AS I WRITE this and I don't know how to tone it out.  I can't listen to music, I thought that years ago, but I'm so sick of listening to the same songs over and over.  edit: BUT DAT TV THOUGH iojtrioewjtowe I HATE HEARING it as background noise AAAAAAAAAAH I can't hear what they're saying at all it just sounds very annoying
TrainerAbu	It's between three nights.  Friday is when The Weeabootique server of Team Fortress 2 is up and everyone in the server is playing anime music and video game music and people keep constantly talking about how they're drinking rum the entire time, Saturday is the Toonami anime marathon on adult swim, Sunday is when I watch all of the new anime episodes and the new Rick and Morty and the new James & Mike Mondays after midnight.  If I ever have any beer left over, I only drink one or two on days that aren't friday/saturday/sunday, though.
TrainerAbu	Dude I tried playing the Team Fortress 2 The Weeabootique on their Fun Friday that I play every time, where everyone is talking about drinking rum, and they're all playing silly songs and trying to be funny by playing micspams about sonic the hedgehog scat fanfics while everyone is jumping aroudn in Low Gravity playing anime music on a "Fun Friday" map.  It just feels weird being there sober.  They just keep taking turns playing anime music and silly weird things I have to sometimes mute, while everyone is talking all silly and some people are saying they're drunk on rum and having a blast hanging out with us and stuff
TrainerAbu	That's just how is for now. I'm so awkward around people. My bro invited me to sit at a table outside with his friends, and his friends said "Did one of his close friends or family members die or something??  Why are we being all awkward like this" and its because my brother invited me to sit with them and I didn't know where to look and.. also another time, when I got back from hanging out with my brother's friends at a campfire, his girlfriend told me "I don't think you realize this, but you made everyone at the campfire feel incredibly awkward the entire time"
TrainerAbu	Yeah I do binge drink them.  If I have any beer left over, I drink them slowly like one or two on a weekday.  Friday is when The Weeabootique, my favorite team fortress 2 server full of people on my friends list, um.. is being played by people and they're all playing anime and video game music.  They're my friends and on my birthday they kept playing birthday songs and gave me lots of games and gifts and stuff.  On Saturday, that's Toonami.  That was an even bigger deal than Fun Friday to me.  They also play The Weeabootique on Saturdays too, and last time I just skipped Toonami and played The Weeabootique.  Those guys at the weeabootique mention drinking rum often.  I wish I got vodka or whiskey or rum or whatever for the weekend, and a 12 pack for the week.  I only drink one or two beers if I drink them on a day that isn't Friday or Saturday.  Well Sunday/early monday I drink a lot too, because that's when I watch all of the new anime episodes that came out, and I watch the new rick and morty, and then I wait all night for the new James & Mike Monday video from Cinemassacre to come out, to watch.
TrainerAbu	I considered it a bunch of times, but I'd be so lonely.  I have no friends at all.  I've been looking at okcupid for new friends, but no one around here seems to mention Nintendo games or anime in their profile. =(
TrainerAbu	Alcohol | I have so many issues with my family.  I wish I knew a good place to vent about them.  I already did on tumblr and suicide forums and on the phone.  My mom says I'm an alcoholic because I get a 12-pack of beer every Friday.  But I'm 30 years old.  And the last three times I took a walk, bought beer with my own money, and tried hiding the beer, my dad would get suspicious and instantly went into the basement and searched for it and mentioned it to me and my mom.  He's obsessed with Reddit and says he loves it all the time.  He told my mom that he looked at the Aspberger's Syndrome subreddit, and that they all talk about alchol a lot, so that I must be an alcoholic because I have Aspberger's Syndrome and he went to the Aspberger's sub-reddit to study up on me, and he said that..  I don't know where to vent about this, I just decided to here since my dad always says "but I looked at the Aspberger's Syndrome, and people said [blank] there, so you must be like [blank] too and that's wrong"  and I don't know where else to vent.  I'm lonely and I wish I had friends too.  I have a lot of depressing issues.
TrainerAbu	Sluggish/laggy | I got a new computer two months ago and its a beast.  But Waterfox runs sluggy/laggy to me.  It runs at 10% cpu often too.  Which I would think wouldn't matter at all, but I just checked it when Waterfox was being kinda sluggy.  It's still a bit sluggy right now, actually.  And when I write a new tumblr post on the front page extremely fast to vent, my computer can't keep up and it just freezes for awhile while I type.  Edge runs better.  Any ideas or tips?  This is my pc: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vJPnVY
TrainerAbu	[Serious] What's a good e-mail provider for joining NeoGAF besides an ISP? | [removed]
TrainerAbu	I can't use an ISP e-mail. My dad is the only one with it. I tried signing up to NeoGAF seven years ago, using my dad's e-mail, but I never saw an e-mail about being accepted as a member (I'm pretty sure my dad deleted it accidentally.)

TrainerAbu	I'm not sure.  I really need friends.  I have problems and stuff I need people to help me with, too.  But in any case, I want friends.  Thank you for the options and advice so far!
TrainerAbu	I also have an ear infection problem.  I can't hear in my left ear.  A walk-in doctor gave me anti-biotics that I take twice a day every 12 hours.  I wanted to call the doctor today, as there's only 4 pills left and I still can't hear on that side (I just hear "Beat beat" inside of me.)  But my mom told me to just wait until all 4 (3 at this point in time) pills are gone, before calling the doctor.  Should I wait until all the pills are gone, or set up an appointment now?
TrainerAbu	How to make new friends online? | My friend that says he uses me to play games with, and the 15 years that I've known him, he always tries to get people to hate me and like him instead, and he keeps doing it with my girlfriends and now my sensei.  I've been posting on my tumblr blog every day multiple times (and my twitter) for like three months now, saying like "Please be my friend I'm so lonely and I'm sad that my friends abandoned me and I really want someone to talk to," but people rarely talk to me or interact with my posts.  How (and where) do I make new friends online?  I don't message people first since I'm so shy.  I'm a guy that likes anime and video games.
TrainerAbu	I can't really use an ISP e-mail.  My dad is the only one with it.  I tried signing up to NeoGAF seven years ago, using my dad's e-mail, but I never saw an e-mail about being accepted as a member (I'm pretty sure my dad deleted it accidentally.)
TrainerAbu	[Serious] What's the cheapest e-mail provider I can use to sign up for NeoGAF? | [removed]
TrainerAbu	I'd pay someone.  It's not a Hamtaro knockoff, though.  It's based on my online life at Hamtaro message boards.

TrainerAbu	Question, how do I get an audience? | Hi!  I feel like a newb to the universe.  I don't know how to do anything.  I write some nice erotic writing.  How can I find an audience that would want to buy my work?  People like my work on fanfiction, inkbunny, furaffanity, and deviantart.  But I'm not sure where I can go to find people that would want to purchase my short stories on amazon.  Like I want to write a story about a guy or girl that..well I won't say in case my idea somehow gets taken, but... it's hawt and..  I wish I knew how to interact with people.  And facebook is so terrible for me.  I join like two facebook groups, and then I get filled up with so much "You are probably a bot, you're not allowed to join a group for three weeks now and you must send photo IDs to us at facebook staff and only join like one group every two months or else we'll keep saying we suspect you to be a bot and you can't join more groups" stuff  I don't know how to get an audience for anything I do.  I tried joining Twitter, but a social media advisor said that my Twitter behavior is "creepy" because I like tweets, sometimes retweet tweets, sometimes interact with followers, sometimes make a tweet, and apparently that's Not the right way to use Tumblr and I'm creeping everyone out according to my social media advisor.  how do I get an audience, aaah
TrainerAbu	I do have something on Amazon (no sales yet) and since then I've been writing on other sites and lots of people like my work.  I also write stories about my hamster rivals series and my few followers on tumblr like them.  I dunno how to build an audience once I have something for them to witness.
TrainerAbu	I have like two routers and I can't access one of them and I can't really be arsed to port forward them right now since I don't even know how anyways,  what's a good way for me and my friend to play SNES and Genesis games over Netplay?  We tried Gens netplay, and we had the same exact files, but it said that our roms file names were wrong or missing or something like that when we tried to join eachother's rooms.

TrainerAbu	What is the best VR content so far? | Hi, I'm new to the Rift, I just got it.  I'm loving it, and I'm not sure what to try out next.  What are the best VR games?  What are some good HD 360 degree videos, and where can I find some?
TrainerAbu	Going to get rift today, how should I mount the censors? | My rift order failed online.  So I'm just going to buy a Rift at Best Buy, later on today.  What specifically is the cheapest things I could get at a Wal-mart or other local store, to make sure the sensors are up high?
TrainerAbu	huh?
TrainerAbu	Yes.
TrainerAbu	How do I overclock my | Hi I just got a S2716DG monitor, and I remember reading on my 60Hz monitor "OMG OMGOGMOG when you get this monitor, you won't believe how smooth it is when you MAD MAD INSANELY QUICKLY move your cursor around like mad man" but its just making me dizzy moving my mouse cursor around really fast at like 4500 polling rate way too fast for me to keep up with, and it doesn't seem as smooth as people say 144hz+ and gsync is =/  how can I overclock my monitor to be 165hz so my mouse cursor is smoother when I move it around?
TrainerAbu	Thank you.  also how do I overclock my S2716DG monitor to run at 165hz?  I'm not sure if this 144hz gsync is as good as people say it is so far, my cursor on the desktop/this window doesn't seem THAT smooth
TrainerAbu	G sync calibration? | [removed]
TrainerAbu	How to make steam bucks with TF2? | I made a topic like this before, but it got deleted.  I guess it's because I linked to my backpack etc, but since someone already made a post like this already two years ago ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/2bjyp6/eli5_how_to_make_money_off_of_the_steam/ ) I guess its ok.  What is the best way to make some money from metal?  Should I trade metal for keys?  Or trading cards?  Or name tags? and what site should I use?  I have no steam bucks, and I wanna make some from all of the metal that I have, so I can get some steam summer sale games.
TrainerAbu	I'm new to this. Some newbie questions. | Hello.  I got a loan out to get a new computer and VR.  I have a lot of questions.  I was gonna order a rift now, but I'm not sure of some things.  1) What's the best way to mount the sensors?  2) How long are the wires?  Do I need extension cables and what kinds?  I'm not sure if the Rift will reach to the other side of my desk that's also to the side of me, where there's a large empty area.  3) Where does it plug into?  4) How many games/content work perfectly fine without a third sensor (in case I wait until next month to get it?)  5) Should I get a third sensor when I order the Rift+Touch?  6) Do you see the outside of the headset while wearing it?  Like the blackness from inside?  Or do you actually 100% see nothing but the game and feel like you don't have something covering your eyes?  I might have more questions later.

TrainerAbu	will I be able to get the rpg maker 3ds fes and play it online with the download/upload games thing, if I hack my 3ds?  can I still use the eshop after installing custom firmware and hacking my 3ds to oblivion?
TrainerAbu	I'm on 10.0.1 or 10.1.0 something like that, I want to install custom firmware and completely hack my 3DS as much as it can possibly be hacked, but all I wanna know is..  Will I lose my SwapNotes??  Has anyone lost their SwapNotes with this?  I need my swapnotes, man...!
TrainerAbu	I really want to know.  Is it safe for me to hack my 3DS yet?  I did already hack it early on when it was just browserhax and no custom firmware or anything was out yet.  But I mean..  is there a chance my 3DS will brick (even if I do every step correctly) or that I'll lose my SwapNotes, if I downgrade and install custom firmware?  This is very very important.  I don't want to lose my SwapNotes.  http://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-launch-swapnote-in-new-versions.472564/ I saw this on gbatemp and it worries me more.  I wanted to put custom firmware on it since it first came out, but people told me there's a .00000001% that it might brick my 3DS, so I keep on waiting until there's no chance that my 3DS will brick if I do all the steps correctly.
TrainerAbu	can someone else help me?  The other response didn't help me much.  I asked on Discord if I should get a 5400 RPM hdd or a 7200 one, and they said 7200.  again, I read a review of a 6TB drive where they complained that even in another room, they could still hear the HDD extremely loudly.  And they're all performance drives for managing servers.  What's a good home 7200 RPM internal HDD that isn't so loud that I can hear it loudly in the other room?  I'm using a 7200 RPM drive right now, and its quiet.  Also the case the other guy linked me was kinda ugly, also I'd rather slim down the cost instead of increasing it.  Does anyone know if the NZXT Kraken X62 is better at cooling than the ARCTIC Liquid Freezer 240?  do I want my CPU delidded??  I thought I was supposed to order a boxed processor from siliconlottery and they delid something and reseal it so that it has cooler temperatures.  If they don't do that, how do they get the processors to be so overclocked?
TrainerAbu	Please help make my build perfect | Hello.  I'm replacing my 13 year old computer with a new one.  I'm a game developer, but I'm targeting to be able to run Wii U games on Cemu (Zelda: Breath of the Wild with 8k texture pack at constant 30fps) at the highest settings possible, and I also want to run the emulator for PS3, 3DS, and Wii at high settings and the highest framerate possible.  I'm a noob, and I have a lot of questions.  (By the way, I mention "this discord" a lot, I forget if its this or the other build a pc subreddit that has a discord I go to)  I don't need to ask for "delidding" when I order from Silicon Lottery, right?  They'll delid it, do something that makes the temperatures better, and then re-seal it and send it back to me, if I don't ask for it to be delid; correct?  I've never overclocked in my life, is the 5.1GHz 7700k gonna make my PC explode when I put it in?  Is the ARCTIC - Liquid Freezer 360 good enough, or would the Noctua D15 be better?  I heard on Neogaf that the ARCTIC liquid freezer is pretty good and underrated or something.  I have DDR4-3200 Memory and the motherboard supports it, but someone in the discord said that intel can't read RAM speeds faster than 2400hz or something like that and that I was therefore buying something that literally can't be used fully.  Can't I overclock the RAM and it will be of benefit (although very small?)  I heard that some games (like Fallout 4) need good RAM speed for high fps.  Is the SSD drive ok?  I was told to use a MMX300, then someone complained to me that the read/write drives are way way way too slow, so I changed it to a 960 EVO, then people on the Discord said that's way too fast, and now I switched to what I have now, which I have no idea what the performance on it is.  Is the HDD going to be too loud??  I read reviews of these 6TB+ drives I got, and I mentioned it on Discord while everyone was yelling at me and stuff, and they said "Of course it will be loud, all hard drives are loud." but the reviews on some of these 6TB hard drives said they "could hear the hard drive loudly in the other room because of how loud it is."  Is BarraCuda Pro quiet enough for a Home PC (the reviews say its quite noisy) and if not, what's a good 6TB to 8TB internal HDD that isn't "so noisy that I can hear it very loudly in the other room?"  I got the Zotac video card only because it had the highest listed Clock speed on pcpartpicker.  Does that mean anything, I mean could I just pick a cheaper 11GB 1080ti graphic card and overclock it as much as this Zotac one can be?  About the Phanteks - ECLIPSE P400S, there is no optical drive.  All I do is listen to burned CDs in the car all day.  Is there a quiet case that supports optical drives?  I want to be able to burn CDs.  If not, that's fine I'll just get an external optical drive I guess....  I originally had the 650W power supply (my build said it was 555W when I had a CPU from pcpartpicker in the build list) but I figure that since I'll be overclocking my computer as much as it can, that I should raise the PSU to a 850W one (it was like cheaper or only a couple dollars more than the 750W one for some reason.)  Was this a good choice?  Or would a 650W PSU be able to handle my OC'd computer?  The person in the Discord that told me, "NO WE TOLD YOU to use a Ryzen CPU and not a i7 one, even though you said you need a i7 for your wii u emulator Cemu purposes." told me "Wow he picked Windows 10 Home, that's it, everyone tell this guy to GTFO our discord." although then like 10 people responded to him saying "um dude what's wrong with that?  windows 10 home is perfectly fine."  so um Is Windows 10 home ok??  cuz I have no idea why some guy at Discord yelled at me and told me to GTFO literally just for having Windows 10 home in the pc part list I linked to.  I only got the whatever the hell a "Gigabyte - GC-WB867D-I REV 4.2 PCI-Express x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter" is supposed to be, cuz I heard it can read PS4 controllers.  Is there another way (cheaper than $30) for my PC to read Wii remotes, PS4 controllers, and bluetooth devices?  How often does the S2716DG go on big sales?  I just missed two of them, before I got out my loan for this computer.

TrainerAbu	After creating Ham Ham Rivals Chat, the online Hamtaro mmorpg game that I've been updating for 15 years and still am,  Rita's Adventure, the RPG Maker 2003 game I made 10 years ago that stars my ex-girlfriend's Hamtaro OC,  Abu Land, a browser game that stars my hamster character Abu,  and at least 5 other games that have hamster characters in it,  I now want to make a RPG Maker MV game on my original "Hamster Rivals" series.  I need the graphics for RPG Maker MV.  The sprite in the image is just from my MMORPG "Ham Ham Rivals Chat."  I want the actual sprites for RPG Maker MV to be more detailed, like the quality of the RTP sprites or at least other sprites people make that have shading.  I may also need your help for making emotions/expressions that the characters can make, and if possible, battle graphics.  I want the resolution to be the default RPG Maker MV size (I wish i knew how to deal with custom resolutions, I assume using alternative resolutions for the tiles and characters will make everything look weird in the editor, but I'm not sure.)  I tried posting this twice before, but no one's offered to help yet, so here I go again.~

TrainerAbu	Good microphone or headset? | Hello.  I'm gonna be doing some streaming and YouTube videos of me hunting "RetroAchievements" (I recommend you look into it, if you don't know about them) in oldschool games.  But I have nothing to record with.  What's the cheapest acceptable microphone or headset that I could grab at a Best Buy for recording my voice for videos and streams?
TrainerAbu	The default size, MV, I need both overworld and battle sprites, and I need clothing and accessories too
TrainerAbu	I'm looking for something different.  That was just a modified graphic from the Hamtaro gameboy game.  I want more colorful detailed shaded sprites or whatever
TrainerAbu	How can I improve my Hamster Rivals project? | 
TrainerAbu	what does RGB mean?  would a i7 core be better?
TrainerAbu	do I really need a 11GB video card or whatever they were linking here https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/6buycv/gaming_pc_2000/ cuz it seems kinda expensive
TrainerAbu	yeah I made a mmorpg fangame about hamtaro that I've been updating for 15 years, and now I wanna make an original series called Hamster Rivals based on my life at hamtaro message boards so I need help with this :X
TrainerAbu	I think I'd rather not talk to you
TrainerAbu	...no
TrainerAbu	um ok I just want a computer to replace my old one it keeps stressing me out aoainfos and now my post was downvoted just like my last one and I don't even know why aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
TrainerAbu	yea well what about how all of the builds ppl on reddit give me, all have 11GB video cards that are $786 do I need that or not cuz I don't think I do and everyone keeps giving me builds with these super expensive graphics cards and I'm confused oijwtetioe
TrainerAbu	?? is a SSD useless or what I have no idea about SSDs  someone on neogaf said SSDs were the biggest difference to them and made the biggset speed difference and it was the biggest thing that made a world of difference to them when they replied to some post that said SSDs aren't that important and idk
TrainerAbu	idk how to fit a ton of games on a 500gb ssd, especially when they're full of add ons and mods and stuff
TrainerAbu	my computer just has 1TB and I keep running out of space.  and my friend kept saying he keeps having to uninstall games because his ssd is so small, though he says there's actually a lot of space and he's just paranoid.
TrainerAbu	I need someone to make hamster Character Generator parts for my Hamster Rivals game | 
TrainerAbu	I need to replace my 13 year old computer | ok help cuz I asked reddit to build me a computer like 6 times, but it keeps being like ~$3,000 and now my parents are saying they won't co-sign a loan for me to get a computer cuz that's too much money or something.  >**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**  Emulation.  I want to play Wii U, 3DS, Wii, DS (upscaled to hd resolution,) at the highest settings possible, eventually (when I get a new monitor) in 3D and stuff.  >**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**   idk anything about money and what'd be too expensive for my parents to co-sign the loan for but I guess like ~$2,500 but hopefully it'll be a lot cheaper cuz my parents probably won't let me get it if its that expensive  >**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.**   the computer place that always overcharges me to upgrade my computer will build it for me I guess in like a week from now.  >**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)**   ?? I guess nothing?  I already have a mouse and a keyboard and a monitor and the computer place will probably put Windows 10 on it without me even asking.  I just need a tower and a..ok I'm REALLY BAD when it comes to technical stuff so uh..I also need uh..GPU or whatever it is and a CPU or whateevr it is and a heatsink I think and a energy thingy mabobber battery voltage thing maybe idk  >**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**   New York  >**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**   insignia keyboard, my barely working G500s mouse that doesn't work right anymore, my logitech speakers that keep making loud buzzing sounds for some reason.  idk where to find the speaker model number.  my HP monitor that I'm not that satisfied with.  but I'll replace these things at a later point in time, hopefully.  >**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**   yes, I have no idea how to OC but I guess I'll look it up.  I want to OC as much as a computer can possibly be OC'd so that I can play Wii U, Wii, 3DS, and DS games at extremely high supersampled resolutions with the highest settings possible in supersampled 4K and 3D etc. I have no idea what any of those words mean but people on neogaf.com seem to like it so it must be pretty looking so yeah  >**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**  I want a big SSD drive really bad and a big hhd drive.  I said I wanted a 2TB SSD drive in my previous posts where people gave me $3,000 builds, but I guess I can deal with a 1TB or 1.5TB SSD drive.  >**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**  not really I just don't want a red neon gamer looking tower that looks like its for a 13 year old hardcore geeky gamer  >**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**  usually the computer place slaps windows 10 on my computer when they fix it.  so I guess not.  wait maybe they actually charge me for that..I think they did..oh well.  I want windows 10 and idk what the differences are I just want a good version for gamers I guess or none at all since the computer place might do it for me anyways.  >**Extra info or particulars:**  my current computer won't run Tumblr or Twitter or facebook or vimeo right and my computer goes extremly slow on a bunch of websites, pls help me replace my 13 year old computer that has 3gb ram

It's pretty funny and has a few side-things to do and stuff.  I really want someone to play it!
immallama	Delete these hate facts
immallama	I had friends, a girlfriend, and I was happy with life. For the first time in a while I was feeling good. Then I woke up. | Is there a shittier feeling than this one? Last night I had a great dream in which I had everything I've ever really wanted then *bam*, I'm awake. Like having a rug pulled out from under you. The first few seconds upon waking up was a rollercoaster ranging from happiness, to confusion, then to one of the shittiest feelings I can describe. Like good times had finally arrived juxtaposed with his shit my reality is. Turns out one of my happiest moments in recent memory was a fucking dream.   I don't recall ever having a dream that was significantly better than my real life before, but I'm sure there are some of you who can relate here :/
immallama	When Jeff tells you your season's theme | 
immallama	The most Reddit post of the day. 
immallama	I can still remember the last time I sat down to watch the series finale almost perfectly. Around the same age too. Just one of those things I'll always remember I gues.   
immallama	Oh shit, duh. 
immallama	No I get it. Like I said it was supposedly fixed but I've still experienced it. I don't really think it's my mouse, as I've had no issues in other games. I guess it's a possibility though.
immallama	[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/6uj18t/no_spoilers_introducing_the_atla_discord/) one. Not sure if it's official though.
immallama	Automatic weapon gun jam? | I've looked into this and I've read that it used to be a common bug that has since been patched. Despite this I've still been encountering this issue pretty often and it's lost me games a few times.  Basically when the gun is set to auto and I left click it just straight up wont fire. Anyone else having problems with this?
immallama	I wish there was some more material on Ozai's past. The Avatar villains are all so fleshed out except the main one ironically. 
immallama	"Oh boy, I'm finally living my dream and competing in Survivor! Can't wait to see what awesome theme my season has!"
immallama	That's true, but still I'd like to see some more about Ozai and his younger years specifically. That would be a neat comic. 
immallama	I'm usually not feeling newbie seasons before they actually premiere. When you can't see the contestants in action it's easy to judge them as boring or whatever.  That applies to this season naturally. Nothing so far is exciting enough to hook me in, which makes me wonder what casual viewers are going to think. Heroes vs Healers vs Hustlers? No new location? Pretty bland cast too. It just feels generic right now. I'm willing to give it a go though and I've been proven wrong before.
immallama	What a fucking legend lmao
immallama	Is it possible some of this may just be paranoia? I get the feeling all the time that people are laughing or staring at me when in reality I'm probably making it up in my head. Not trying to minimize what you're saying but it's something to consider.   I know what you mean though. New college student here as well. One of my first days I decided to go out and potentially actually meet some people. As I'm walking down the street a car pulls up with some older students and the driver laughs and asks me how old I am, reminding me of course that I look like a fucking High School freshman at best. All I could do was nervously laugh and go back to my dorm and sleep for the rest of the day. Guy was a douche but the worst part was he wasn't really wrong. So yeah that was my reality check. 
immallama	Oh really. I haven't gotten around to reading The Search yet. Guess I shouldn't judge until I do. 
immallama	That's true, but still I'd like to see some more about Ozai and his younger years specifically. That would be a neat comic. 
immallama	That's true, but still I'd like to see some more about Ozai and his younger years specifically. That would be a neat comic. 
immallama	"Trust nobody. Not even yourself."
immallama	The two moments that tricked me into thinking it would be a good season.
immallama	Depends what you're looking for I guess. I'd probably just stick with amazon. 
immallama	Holy shit I think it's time for a rewatch. 
immallama	TTYD 2
immallama	9001
immallama	Same. I keep accidentally playing on Asian servers. 
immallama	Eliza blocked me on twitter. Can't remember what for though.   I *think* Sandra followed me around the time she joined Twitter which is my crowning achievement though. 
immallama	He couldn't help himself from going on about a BIG MOVEZ there in the end could he.   Still, I'm feeling a little better about this cast now. Despite the stupid theme they all seem to actually fit into their tribes. (Minus maybe "diversity advocate" which doesn't even sound like a real job title, but whatever)
immallama	Don't you hate it when you're swimming and your body betrays you and drags you under the water? Thank god for lifeguards. 
immallama	That whole direct could have been Odyssey and I'd be happy honestly. It looks fucking amazing.
immallama	Honestly why I rewatch older seasons over newer ones so much. So much of the shows personality comes from the culture and adventure aspects of actually living out in these remote and sometimes unknown regions.   When it's just a generic beach with a focus on strategy it becomes difficult to even differentiate different seasons. 
immallama	Someone please send this to Jeff. 
immallama	Worst part of TLOK. Not very well written. 
immallama	The show without a doubt it going down a slippery slope. What made Survivor so recognizable in the past is slowly being rooted out and tossed away. 
immallama	Oh shit. That sounds awesome. 
immallama	I don't know if it's realistic but I'm hoping for at least one big first party game we haven't seen yet. Animal Crossing, Pikmin 4, Luigi's Mansion, etc.   My biggest hope is that Color Splash for the Wii U was a side project and the next real Paper Mario is on its way now. 
immallama	I'm literally not hurting anyone my dude. Grow the fuck up. 
immallama	I don't care if I'm being overdramatic. They've lost touch of why the show was so great. Old Survivor is dead. We're in the era of dumb themes, shitty casting, over excessive twists, big movez, and uninspired production values. 
immallama	wew. The claim was that white people never say it, which is false. If that upsets you you're going to have to take out your anger on more than just me.  >if you wanna talk like a 14 year old with corn rows and a basketball jersey that's on you.  We've come to the point where you're so upset right now that you're pushing racist stereotypes now. This is gold.
immallama	I think casting was atrocious for Game Changers (like maybe the worst casting for a season yet), and I'm definitely not feeling the current cast. I'll wait before I judge too much though. 
immallama	I wouldn't give half a shit about furries if they'd just admit already that it's a fetish. 
immallama	Let's be honest, they're never going to do that. They'd rather force a theme like HvHvH because they think it's easier to market. 
immallama	Okay yeah I agree. KR and MvGx casts were pretty great.
immallama	Samsung it is. 
immallama	I N N O V A T I O N
immallama	Haha, awesome. Very cool find!
immallama	Where did you hear about the Mediterranean map? Sounds sick. 
immallama	Awesome, the first season is amazing and easily one of my favorites. Still holding out hope for a S3, even if it's not super likely.
immallama	I couldn't possibly give less of a shit dude. Quite frankly I'll say whatever the hell I want with friends. We don't care. None of us are offended, and we only do it when we're with eachother, so why does it matter? It doesn't. And it doesn't effect anyone else at all.  Sorry, but you don't get to police what words I say in my own private life. Ironically you're acting even more immature about it. So again I'll reiterate: I don't care.
immallama	Wow, the new Ted arc is WILD!
immallama	>Added FPP Leaderboard for all regions with FPP  Yesssssssss. Wonder if previous games before this was implemented will carry over.
immallama	Luckily I don't have any friends who will tattle on my for saying a bad word.
immallama	Third episode of Avatar the Last Airbender where Aang, 12 years old, witnesses the aftermath of the genocide of his entire nation. He even sees the corpse of what was once his greatest friend/mentor. Imagine the survivors guilt there.   And this was only the third episode of a kids cartoon. 
immallama	The Korra one was probably the best one.
immallama	I don't even know if he realized it.
immallama	Flair checks out.
immallama	Only a true intellectual can comprehend the utter genius of the cinematography.
immallama	This will be my first Survivor season in Uni and I'm starting to wonder how it's gonna work out. Do you watch live or wait for a download or something? 
immallama	She's not wrong about anything really.
immallama	Absolutely. You won't regret it. 
immallama	Thanks! Hopefully I can keep my Wednesday night traditions going. 
immallama	Any idea what the badges are? Not that Dan would necessarily use them either way...
immallama	Is the claw machine necessary to progress or no? Can't remember. I'm worried Dan's gonna forget about the gear.
immallama	You're one dedicated conspiracy theorist :\^)
immallama	Oh cool. Yeah I hope so too. 
immallama	Subaru's breakdown really made me love him as a character. 
immallama	Someone supposedly found a Dharma prop on the LOST beach in Hawaii | 
immallama	Oh cool! Yeah I'm not getting my hopes up too much but I've been meaning to read them forever so I might as well. I believe the server is still up just not super active on weekdays. I think there's another recently created Avatar server (Korracraft maybe? Can't remember the name), but I've yet to check it out.
immallama	I agree with this. If we're gonna have a meme day might as well just allow it on the main sub in addition to the mega thread on the other six memeless days.  Still, this is a step in the right direction and better than nothing.
immallama	Haha I know what you mean. Gotten back into the show lately and I'm kind of longing for a new series now. Hopefully it's not dead forever. Thinking about reading the comics finally actually. Other than that I'm in uni now so that's certainly interesting.
immallama	>White people never say it, hard R or not.  I say it with friends all the time. It's not a big deal at all, literally just depends who you're with. 
immallama	Hey Howz! Been a while. How you doing?
immallama	np lol
immallama	Steins;Gate Elite. We'll be getting new news this month at TGS I believe. 
immallama	I'm the opposite. I wanted Light to win so badly and it was amazing any time his plans came together. 
immallama	I always wanted an Appa plush. I was close to buying one once but they stopped selling them.   Enjoy college :)
immallama	Maybe the dumbest thing I've read since "video games make kids shoot up schools"
immallama	I love how that seems to be the title of an episode every season too.
immallama	:(
immallama	Petitions are useless for almost anything. A petition of cancel a show is just stupid honestly and you can really blame them for not even reading it. 
immallama	I definitely agree. It seems to be pretty deeply embedded in popular culture for a lot of people. I've seen more avatar related memes in the past few months than ever before (the eclipse for example). This sub has also seen some growth lately with a lot of people getting back into the show.   Keeping people talking about Avatar is honestly the best way to get a new series. Networks pay attention to that kind of stuff more than petitions or anything else of that sort. There seems to be a pretty big untapped audience that not even Korra was able to reach. 
immallama	Ah, makes sense. I know what you mean lol
immallama	This is the most Reddit post I've read in a whole. Congrats. 
immallama	The anti-Spencer circlejerk on /r/Survivor was pretty insane. This place can be awful sometimes.
immallama	Huh, maybe I will. Thanks!
immallama	At the very least he definitely "broke". (Suzuha ending in the VN)
immallama	I feel like I recognize your username from somewhere outside this sub. /r/GameOfThrones maybe?
immallama	That's not even what you were saying. You said that a white nationalist who stabbed a black guy in NYC was subscribed to Pewdiepie and this somehow means something. (I'd like to know how you even know he was subscribed to him but that's beside the point)  It's no different than "this murderer had a video game at home. Now we're not saying they're connected but..." or "Hitler drank water once, X drank water once... Coincidence???"  Your logic is honestly retard tier. 
immallama	Healthy young child goes to Youtube, gets pumped with massive doses of PewDiePie, doesn't feel good and changes - NAZI. Many such cases.
immallama	The moon obviously has Russian ties -CNN
immallama	Sozin basically made it a sport. If you killed a Dragon you were among the strongest firebenders (Dragon of the West)
immallama	Watching with a live chat is kind of surreal. 
immallama	Just so you know there's not a "main" villain in LOK. Each season kind of has their own conflicts. 
immallama	I'll be buying this anyway but I'd love to buy it for my Switch specifically!
immallama	It's going to have a slightly updated story. Probably some tweaks here and there and some new scenes. Maybe they'll flesh out vertain things that were glossed over and add some references to Zero.   Other than that I'd really love to see updated sprites and CGs. The artstyle was cool but the sprites are super outdated compared to Huke's newer art. 
immallama	Haha yeah... it's certainly... interesting. 
immallama	So this is where things go to shit real fast. Jesus Christ what the fuck
immallama	Just stopping by during your daily stroll through rising to find something to be outraged about?
immallama	 I think it just stems from the fact that something feels "missing" in Korra's writing at times. It makes some mistakes not even slightly present in ATLA. So the natural question to ask is "what changed?" Ehasz not being present is one of those things so it's easy to imagine maybe things would have been slightly improved if he were there. 
immallama	Fun fact: Trump sometimes told the story of Priebus telling trump he'd lose in the biggest landslide in US politics to people for fun. 
immallama	The media never quite jumped on a single narrative quite like that week. I'll have to admit even I began to lose hope at the nonstop "Trump is done" they tried to hammer into people's heads. Just goes to show effective media brainwashing is and how amazing it was that people didn't fall for it. 
itssarakang	Lonely af | I wish I didn't care about how I looked. Most of my life, I was told that I was pretty and used to be approached by model agency scouts, so I grew up being very aware of how I looked. I experienced first-hand the advantages of being considered beautiful, and always see the difference in how I'm treated on my not-so-pretty days (like back when I used to take a lot of MDMA/cocaine/drink a lot out at the club for literally 5 days straight. Not taking breaks from bad vices can really take a toll on your face/health. Please don't do it.)  I got (and still am addicted) to being so loved because they think I'm beautiful. It's so shallow but I can't help it.   I moved to the States for college 2 years ago and I don't have any actual close friends. This is all my fault -- people are very friendly here, but when I get invited out to something as simple as lunch, I make up an excuse and flake because I get so dizzy and nervous around people. I'm always having guys (both bad and good lol) ask me out and even if I'm interested in them, I make up excuses not to see them because I feel so pressured to look good that I end up just keeping myself prisoned in my room. Some of them think it's just because they I'm "snobby" and assume I'm an elitist or whatever but I wish they could just somehow read my mind and understand that's not it at all. I get nervous just throwing out my trash or getting my mail because of how self-conscious I am of people looking at me. I'll have bags and bags of trash accumulate in my closet room because I get so worked up just to step out of my room. I know I need to just not give a fuck but it's so damn hard to get out of your own head.   With me always keeping myself jailed in my room, I started to depressed/stress-eating and already gained 20 to almost 30 pounds. I was underweight before so even with the weight gain I'm still in the "normal" BMI right now (130 pounds at 5"3), but my body isn't used to it and so I now not only suffer emotional distress but physical distress, too. I'm always feeling nauseous plus I cry nearly every day.  On a slightly more positive note, I finally gained a bit of motivation to stop trying to eat to feel better. I might not be able to fix my mental issues but at least I can do something about my physical ones. Although now that I'm not distracted with food, I'm A LOT more aware of how fucking lonely I am.   I want to go home. I want to be with my parents. I want to be with my friends who grew up with me and understand what to do and how to handle my depression/anxiety. I'm so tired of feeling so fucking lonely. Look at all these social media followers and likes, while I'm actually this lonely and depressed in my room. 
itssarakang	I'm Korean-Japanese but I was born and raised in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Parents lived in the Philippines for over 35 years. Oh yeah, I have family in Korea and I can confirm the study culture there is a LOT crazier with the whole studying thing like they'll have an after-school academy and will come home late or even at midnight. That's why there's an alarmingly high suicide rate for students... It's insane. So in comparison to that, I know it's a lot more lax for us but my parents still did put a lot of pressure on us since they grew up in Korea. I went to a private international school in Manila where all my classmates and friends were children of politicians/celebrities/rich businesspeople, so we had IB and all our teachers were recruited from all over the world. As students, we were expected to get really good grades so that we can get into Ivy League schools.  Not that this is relevant, but Pacquiao's (the boxer) kids went to my school haha  You're right though. It's just hard to spread love to the world when I don't love myself. I do have a lot of 'third culture kid' problems; I'm viewed as an Americanized Filipino by Korean/Japanese people, viewed as an American by Filipinos (even though I'm not actually American), and viewed as this "exotic" mix of Korean Japanese Filipino by Americans. I went to an international school growing up though so I feel like I'm very open to a lot of cultures but I feel alienated sometimes in places like the States or Korea where race is such a big deal. It's weird because America calls itself the land of the free, but people seem so trapped within their own race even with there being so much diversity.  Thanks, I'll definitely order the DHEA on Amazon. As for going to the physician... I'll tryyyy to find the courage to go lol 
itssarakang	No, not on Xanax. Took Xanax years ago for a short while but my mom is very traditionally Asian so she thinks fixing mental illness should be "natural." But to be honest the Xanax just made me feel sleepy and numb and didn't really help.   You're right, I do seek to be noticed. I like feeling looked after and cared for. I think it might stem from having two very busy parents (Business owners of their own companies) and having over a decade age gap with my two older siblings. My maids were always the ones looking after me growing up. Everything you've been saying is right!! Had a lot of high expectations placed on me, not only on my appearance but also my abilities. My parents are traditionally Asian parents while my siblings and I were born and raised in an Americanized environment so there was always a clash. We always had to be on the honor roll, always on the varsity teams and other clubs, etc. Was good at art, had to know how to play instruments. My siblings and I went crazy trying to be perfect so it's kind of why us three had such hardcore party lives as well, just to let loose. Except now I'm too anxious to do that either, so I just go insane in my room.  I don't want to do this to myself! But it's not something I can just turn off when it's how my brain was wired growing up.   How do I get DHEA? And Zofran? What do I say to the doctor? I've never gone to the hospital on my own before. 
itssarakang	I've always had pretty bad anxiety but not to the point that I'd actually shake.   I have like one pad of Valiums that my older sister gave me when I saw her during the summer that I save for days I know I need to do something important like presenting in class. Other than that, not taking any prescribed medication. There's so many different kinds of meds available so I guess I'm just overwhelmed to go on that journey to find the right kind for me. Also a bit worried it'll affect my sex drive 
itssarakang	Thank you. Yes my mom (well my family in general) is very healthy so she's always sending me supplements so I regularly take vitamins, omegas, iron, etc. Whats DHEA? What's Zofran exactly and how do I get prescription for it? Yes I'm aware that my anxiety is very severe but I do also suffer depression. I've suffered from anxiety my whole life (used to take Xanax for it) but depression also often comes in lapses and right now is probably the worst I've experienced so far. Depression is the conditioner to my shampoo (anxiety) lol.   Its so hard to actually do it. I feel like I need to be super beautiful to distract people from noticing what a nervous & depressed person I actually am. I don't know how to "treat" it little by little. I don't know what to say, whenever people talk to me it's like my mind wanders off and I get lost in my own mind. 
itssarakang	I've tried going to the counselor twice, but stopped for the same reasons why I take so long to throw out the trash.   Yes, I feel vulnerable and also I get physically uncomfortable around people now. I noticed that I'd be shaking if I'm too close to someone I'm not familiar and comfortable with and I don't know where to look. I can't keep eye contact anymore 
itssarakang	Easy, low-calorie (less than 400 calories) recipes? | I'm a student who still doesn't know how to properly cook an omelette, so my cooking skills really are at the bare minimum.  I just recently decided to go on a diet after gaining 20ish pounds but am struggling to find tasty, low-calorie recipes.  Any suggestions? Books? What are your favorites?
itssarakang	I'm only on day 5 of my diet (which is honestly the longest I've gone being obedient tbh) but was wondering when you can start incorporating cheat days? I feel like having a cheat day on the first week of my diet might just trigger me to lose my self control, but at the same time I might go crazy and binge if I don't. Thoughts and advice?
itssarakang	Ooh wow this is a really holistic way of viewing it. I should try to think this way instead! It's been hard because my diet from ages 0-19 was set by my parents (who are super healthy) and plus we had maids cooking for us. Being on my own in the States for the last 2.5 years meant my diet drastically changed and it's hard to do things on my own & also when there's so much freedom to binge eat. I hope I can regain my old eating habits and appetite!
itssarakang	Also, as a 5"3 130 pound girl, would consuming at most 1200 calories per day (without exercise) be enough for me to lose weight? How long and how much would you estimate for me to lose in a month? Is it even possible to lose that much weight without exercise? 
itssarakang	Sounds expensive? Pack of 12 is $37 so that's $37 for 4 days? 
itssarakang	All the recipes on this site looks sooo good 😳 haha yeah I put her cooking books in my Amazon cart just now 💕
itssarakang	How'd you maintain it? Also, do you drink? Alcohol is probably the biggest obstacle during the weekends haha
itssarakang	... I love you for introducing me to /r/1200isplenty this is exactly the sort of subreddit I needed 💖
itssarakang	Whaaat why is this allowed? 5 is not 0 😒
itssarakang	I don't exercise at all, so 1200 sounds about right for me. 
itssarakang	You were right! Thank youuu, I was needing something like this 
itssarakang	The drink? For breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
itssarakang	How long did it take you? 
itssarakang	Thank you 😭👏🏼💖
itssarakang	I live in a near-campus apartment that does have a kitchen, but I also have a George Foreman. Is it healthier to grill it on that or to oven roast it? Also I find that I sometimes accidentally buy chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, are they that much different? 
itssarakang	How long did it take to lose 30 pounds? That's exactly how much weight I gained. Was that just following your diet or was that in conjunction with exercise? 
itssarakang	I generally eat high protein without realizing it because I love chicken, fish, eggs, and my flavored protein powders. I just struggle with eating more fat and less carbs for keto.   
itssarakang	I think Kendall and Kourtney had the least (if not none) done. 
itssarakang	I'm the same way, I'm just a 5"3 girl and am about 130 pounds now. I used to be 95-100 pounds and putting into consideration the fact that I have a larger chest than average and booty I was skinny before.  I never had to watch what I eat back then but I grew up with a small appetite (my friends used to say I ate like a bird since they pick up small pieces one at a time haha), but moving to the states just really intensified my hunger. Probably because of the big portion sizes here + greasy food. I'm used to finishing what's on my plate because that's how it was back home, so learning how to portion control will have to come later on in my journey to getting my old weight back. For now, just need to cook full meals that that have the exact calories I need haha 
itssarakang	Cheat days - when to start? | [removed]
itssarakang	This is great advice! Luckily I never really liked soda, energy drinks, or having Starbucks too often. I think my main problem really is just the food I'm eating. I grew up with housemaids who cooked for us and parents who were strict and made sure we ate healthy food. Moving to college just led to me just stuffing my face because I didn't know anything about cooking and it was easier to eat greasy take out all the time. 
itssarakang	Yes, you're right! I just personally prefer eating an entire meal instead of having to think about dividing it up into portions and eating it another day, if that makes sense. I have been tracking my food, it's just that I'm bored of making the same 4 dishes since I have such a limited knowledge on cooking and that's what usually leads to me eating junk.
itssarakang	What's something yummy that you could make with celery? I over-ate the celery-hummus combo haha
itssarakang	Also, what did you use to figure out what to eat? I find that my downfall is due to not knowing what to eat and end up just taking the easy route and ordering delivery. Also how'd you stay motivated? And when did you start allowing yourself to have cheat days (if you have them)? 
itssarakang	Wow, 130 pounds 👏🏼👏🏼 that's amazing!! Was it all just because of your change in diet or did you exercise as well? 
itssarakang	I actually prefer oven roasting in general because I don't have to actually do the cooking myself. But the results are always inconsistent- sometimes they'll turn out okay but a lot of the times they get burnt. What am I doing wrong? 180C and for how long? 
itssarakang	Do they have an app? 
itssarakang	Oh nooo I love pickles! For some reason the jar of pickled dills that I bought claim they have zero calories... that can't be true right? 
itssarakang	Yeees I can't believe I just saw this subreddit now! 🌺
itssarakang	I love the idea of meal prep but then won't the food's quality deteriorate over the next few days? How to keep it tasting delicious haha
itssarakang	For what, specifically? Everything? 
itssarakang	Ahhh thank you so much for this! 
itssarakang	Easy, low-calorie (less than 400 calories) recipes? | I'm a student who still doesn't know how to properly cook an omelette, so my cooking skills really are at the bare minimum.  I just recently decided to go on a diet after gaining 20ish pounds but am struggling to find tasty, low-calorie recipes.  Any suggestions? Books? What are your favorites?
itssarakang	She goes bare faced quite often on her snaps though, and she's definitely still gorgeous with the make up.   What do cheek fillers do? 
itssarakang	Her face though? Her face looks different if you compare to 3 years ago but can't pinpoint why lol
itssarakang	What did Kylie get done though do you think? I genuinely can't tell hers looks so much more natural than Kim's lol 
itssarakang	Thank you so much! I only recently started cooking with vegetables and I always wonder why they keep getting burnt haha 
itssarakang	Does anyone know Kylie Jenner's surgeon and what she got done? | I think Kylie looks so good right now, and want whatever she had done but I can't tell what she did other than her boobs and lips. Her face looks different too but when I actually compare her before and after photos nothing looks like it actually got altered.  It'd be amaaazing if someone actually knew where she went to get plastic surgery 
itssarakang	Which vegetables to cook first? The order? | Beginner here, please excuse me if this is a stupid question.  Let's say you're making a vegetable stir fry dish or oven roasted vegetables. Which vegetables should go in first? 
itssarakang	Super helpful, thank you!! 💕
itssarakang	Not sure if I can continue -- should I take a break from college after this semester? | My depression since I started college has really taken a toll on me both mentally and physically. I'm starting to think that the best option for me is to take maybe a year off college or something and resume to finish my last two years but I'm not sure if that's even possible? What happens when you stop? If you come back, do you have to start over? Will they even let you come back?   What happens? What can I do? College work isn't that hard but what's making it so hard for me is the fact that I can barely get out of bed or have the energy to socialize with anyone, even my family members. I've been consistently crying almost every day for two years. I'm at a point where I'm worried that I'll be capable of killing myself because I feel like there's a black hole sucking me into myself 
itssarakang	I used to be able to reach way past my toes because I was athletic in high school but am appalled that I can't reach my toes without being in pain now.   How to train yourself to become flexible?  
itssarakang	Will jogging in place in your room be as effective (in respect to burning calories) as actually walking/jogging outside?  
itssarakang	What if it's just for the purpose of burning calories? I get about 5,000 steps a day walking to my classes but trying to get in at least 10,000. So I just jog in place while I read my textbooks, etc. 
itssarakang	I was literally wondering what I could do to calm down 'cause my heart is racing and I'm in bed, and came across this post.   Really hope we figure this out!! 
itssarakang	Wasting an entire day to just masturbate [f] | 21 y/o female here. I can literally spend all day masturbating but still not feel satisfied even if I cum  over 10 times. Does anyone struggle with this problem lol 
itssarakang	I mean he's good at fucking but he's not comfortable with degrading me like the choking and name-calling.  He's like 8.5 inches? He's a 6"5 tall football qb so he's a big guy lol 
itssarakang	That's what I do. But since I've spent literally all day doing it I still end up cumming 10ish times 
itssarakang	He gives, but he's too gentle and loving 😭 I need it rough at least 50% of the time 
itssarakang	It's like the heavens thought that since he was a hot athlete with an actually fun personality they thought it'd only be fair if his sex game was created to be super vanilla UGH WHYYY
itssarakang	To date.   Hold up I'll update this post in a bit haha  Edit: read my new description, por favor 
itssarakang	Oh wow didn't know something like that existed. I'll definitely get that checked out! 
itssarakang	fucking DADDIES 
itssarakang	Oh that's what I do!
itssarakang	I used to masturbate in the shower everyday before school but I stopped doing that so that it's not so numb when I actually have sex with my guy lol   What's edging
itssarakang	The Lion 🔥😩 
itssarakang	Yeees. So fucking sexy ugh
itssarakang	So sexually attracted to everyone in season 3 | Why does every single guy on the show in season 3 suddenly seem x10 sexier omg  
itssarakang	fuck me up Jorge 
itssarakang	😩❤️
itssarakang	she's beautiful too but I lost my attraction to her when she was ok with her husband being killed and just moved on with no problem 
itssarakang	RIIIIGHT goddamn 
itssarakang	Not me, I love saying daddy.... sue me!!!! 😩✨ They're so sexy I can't functionally live life anymore 
itssarakang	Hahaha I thought I was the only one who was attracted to Bill. Daniel Van Ness is low key sexy too
itssarakang	truuue 
itssarakang	Huhhh I don't see a dimply chin. He's so sexy 
itssarakang	Totally agree. I get so hyped watching each episode
itssarakang	1) It's so frustrating how fragile the masculinities of some guys' are. 2) Just do it for him so that it feels a bit more like "my girlfriend made me do this" (but secretly liking how clean they look, boys you know this is true) instead of him actually doing it himself.   Let him know he can't touch you until his nails aren't all jagged 
itssarakang	Love Keegan & Peele, but as a woman, I wish I could send this to every single male on the planet!! https://youtu.be/QyViuXFyIE4 Seriously though, this episode really explains everything you need to know about how to eat pussy  Personally, I think the most important thing is: don't flick ur tongue too hard on the clit, think of the pussy as eating a peach or orange.   
itssarakang	Ohhh no, please don't assume I'm not trying to conserve water. I'm almost sure I'm wasting more water because the water pressure is so weak because I end up taking a longer time in the shower trying to rinse off everything properly.   Thank you for the advice! 
itssarakang	How to increase water pressure? (Shower head) | Hi r/howto,   I recently moved to a different state (Arkansas) for college and have lived in 2 dorms and currently live in an apartment but they all have one thing in common: weak water pressure. As a college student, it frustrates me how weak the water pressure is (costs me more time to get myself thoroughly clean) and I've also noticed an increase in skin issues (white heads, black heads, occassional acne even with a good skincare routine).  Is it possible to increase the water pressure of my shower head? Would buying a new shower head change anything or does it only come down to the water pressure of the water of the apartment I live in? 
itssarakang	Can't focus in class because all I think about is | I always find myself missing the entire lecture because I was just spacing out thinking about sex or thinking about dying.  🌺how do u get educated when ur a depressed nympho🌺
itssarakang	Yes, for sure!! 
itssarakang	That's what happens with strangers but I'm talking about people who are in my personal bubble (school, town) 
itssarakang	Well... basically hahaha
itssarakang	I do all that and beyond, I rarely respond via social media/texts but they're so persistent in person as well. I can never understand their thought process-- would they feel satisfied if I gave in even though they knew I don't want them? I hate being objectified as the trophy wife type 
itssarakang	I was thinking the same thing! My tip though is to not read anything unless you're at a real low 
itssarakang	Yeah, so true unfortunately. That stereotype is why I keep hearing "why would you be depressed if you're beautiful?" It only just gives me more reason not to want to that open about it or seek help. I push people away because I don't want to be there to witness their realization that I'm not what they expected me to be.   That really touched me. Thanks for making my thoughts and feelings feel worthwhile x   
itssarakang	It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one. I can never find the courage to actually talk about my problems with anyone in person though. I've gone to the counseling center here once or twice but never went back because even the counselor assigned to me made me feel kind of uncomfortable. I'm lucky my best friends & party friends back home can relate to me and talk to me about my mental illness but it's not the same as having someone actually experiencing what I'm experiencing in this new state with me.  I've been asked to join a sorority and some clubs but I turned them down because of my (what I think I'm developing) mild agoraphobia  I get temporarily distracted when there's either shopping, make up, or alcohol involved but I don't think any of those "interests" are actually really beneficial for my well-being. I want to regain the passion I had for literature/art/psychology/sports that I used to but I've grown so disinterested and detached from life   Thank you though. I appreciate that you even bothered to read my loooong ass post which wasn't even well written ahaha x    
itssarakang	hahaha waiiit doesn't mean it's definite though! genetic vs environmental factors 
itssarakang	Yes it's genetic.
itssarakang	I think they'd look fresh on anyone! Yeah you have to find a size converter chart 
itssarakang	But I wasn't ever allergic to mosquito bites before, so I'm confused why I'm having this reaction now? 
itssarakang	Thanks for the recommendation!! The Mederma gel is in my cart now lol 
itssarakang	I recently purchase this soothing balm stick from Amazon that had good reviews for my bites but it hasn't really done much for them. This is the first time I've had this problem though 
itssarakang	[Skin Concerns] Mosquito bite scars? | Hi r/SkincareAddiction,  My apartment (in Arkansas) was plagued by mosquitoes at the beginning of the month as it usually is around this time of the year. For some reason, my mosquito bites were a lot more severe than usual and still have not faded after almost 3 weeks. Although the itchiness is mostly gone, the color hasn't faded away and is actually leaving a scabby scar, as if it was acne.  Has this ever happened to any of you?? Does anyone know why it's like this? What can I do to get rid of them? 
itssarakang	These on a girl? 
itssarakang	Cop or drop? | 
itssarakang	How to get rid of weird white lint from laundry? | 
itssarakang	Oh that's exactly what I did hahah
itssarakang	I'm a college student who just learned how to do laundry last year but I'm still at a loss why a lot of my clothes come out with this sort of weird lint all over my clothes. Where are these coming from and what can I do? 
itssarakang	Ooh interesting life hack haha thanks I'll try this out! 
itssarakang	Yup! 
itssarakang	I'm not sure because it doesn't look as severe as the pictures online. They're not red and they don't have the white pus looking discoloration either.   I actually did purchase Amlactin a few months ago but it hasn't improved anything for me unfortunately so I'm desperate haha 
saulmontag	I think I'm going to try it tomorrow | Background: this isn't my first rodeo. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and 14 years later they're coming up again, louder than ever.  When I heard about Chester Bennington and his history of abuse I learned that we were victimized at the same ages. His music was life support when I was young, and I can't shake the idea that this is just what happens when your life was too hard to deal with as a kid. I have 3 degrees in psychology but still can't get this to stop. And really that's all I want at this point, not to be stuck in this body and mind anymore.  I lost my job due to depression, lost my partner for similar reasons, survived a car crash but it fucked with my brain, and that's just the past 2 years. I haven't been able to pick myself up and find a life worth living. Instead I keep treading water. No matter how many job apps I put out or plans I make for the future, it doesn't pan out. It feels like the end of the road, and all I want is an end to the suffering.  Tomorrow I'm going to a show to see one of my favorite bands. I've been using this show as a reason to hang on for the past couple months -  it's silly, but it's been working. But when it's over, there's not a whole lot else to keep me here and I figure if I'm still unhappy at the end of the night then what the hell is the point of holding on.  If it comes to that tomorrow night, I'm going to try hanging myself with a bedsheet slip knotted to the doorknob, thrown over top and slip knotted again around the neck. I've gotten into the set-up before just to see if it would hold and it does. I worry about my cat since it's just me and her and I don't want to cause her pain not having her owner around (she's very attached). But in the end it's either going to be her or me who goes first...it's inevitable.   I don't know why I'm telling you any of this. I'm just so alone and it would be good to feel heard, I guess.
saulmontag	Lol trash cats. And nope, my lady is a diamond...she's still curled up and purring in my arms. I had no idea that sub existed until now and I've already laughed a few times more than expected today. Thanks for the company and conversation.
saulmontag	Yeah female orange kitties are rare, and mine has circular tabby stripes which are apparently even rarer. She's super vocal too and as she's gotten older she's gotten more whiny sounding...but she's my bud. She's 9 and I've had her since she was 5 weeks old.   And I feel you - wouldn't it be great if we all could just have cat brains and be taken care of all day?
saulmontag	[picture reference, taken moments ago](https://imgur.com/a/nApXC)  "If the future isn't panning out try living for the present." Teared up a little when I read that...it's so easy, TOO easy, to get tangled up in everything else. Going to try meditating on that tonight and see if it helps tomorrow.  
saulmontag	Thank you, my therapist has actually told me that before and it's been nice to hear. I'm starting to realize the strength I must have to keep going through everything I've been through and to be doing so "well" from what people can see on the outside. Believe it or not I used to be a therapist before my depression took me out of the field...so I know exactly what could get me hospitalized and I'm not willing to risk it. Imagine being a therapist stuck in a psych ward -- been there, done that, not fun! 
saulmontag	Thank you, it meant a lot to me in that moment to read what you said. And I've spent years in therapy -- it's what's helped me get through it this long. I just hesitate to tell my therapist about the suicidal urges out of fear of being committed to a hospital again. I hate those places.
saulmontag	I feel like I never stood a chance. | My life's been a train going at full tilt, jostling off the rails, mowing over people and trees and everything in its path without losing any speed, waiting for the crash.   I'm at the point now where I feel desperate for the crash. I want it to stop. No matter what I do, the pain keeps coming back, and it's not just normal pain.   It's decades of agonizing depression, anxiety, a history of abuse and trauma that I can't seem to move on from despite tons of therapy.   They broke me when I was a child and my whole life's been about trying to rise back up against the odds, look/act normal, shove all the anger/hurt/negativity into a box (aka eating disorder) and try never to let it see the light of day.  I've opened to spirituality, I see the light and good in things. But the light and good can only soothe so much when my thinking devolves into dark spirals, and then the depression becomes about punishment and what the fuck did i do to deserve this life if there's such a thing as karma, and why does it have to be me, and will this ever go away.   I've wanted to die since I was 12. Made a deal with myself that I would do it when I was older. Maybe I'm just getting closer to that time.   I want someone to help. I want someone to give me a hug. I want someone to give a damn, just enough to let me talk and be listened to with unbridled acceptance and regard. For as long as I need. Maybe days. But I'm absolutely convinced that person doesn't exist, at least not for me.   I'm sitting here alone in my studio apartment, wrapped up in blankets, waiting for the shit feeling to pass. I've done this more times than I can count. I don't have the willpower to do it much more.  
saulmontag	Thank you. I'm trying not to blame myself -- that's one of my biggest struggles, it's hard for me to step back and realize something isn't my fault. I was abused by my family when I was a kid (dad and stepdad abused, mom turned the other way) and it was really traumatic. I've come so so so far since then but my past still holds me back
saulmontag	Continuing in life affords you the opportunity to die to who you are right now and reinvent yourself into someone else, someone who values what you value, someone who takes no shit, someone who's not trapped in a life they don't know how to use. It seems paradoxical, but dying to who you are is entirely possible if you choose to go on. The alternative is either absolute nothingness -- which leaves your story and transformation incomplete -- or an afterlife, which may be influenced by the decision you made to take your life. Since we don't know what's in the afterlife, we also don't know whether you'll truly be happy there. Depression clouds our judgement -- it gives us a negativity bias where suicide feels like the logical option, but really there's clarity missing. Hoping you have someone in your life to help you work through what you're thinking.
saulmontag	When I was in school for psych, we learned to assess the need to breach confidentiality and involve others based on four dimensions: level of suicidal ideation (is it intense and frequent? are the thoughts theoretical or practical?), lethality (how deadly), accessibility (do you have the materials you need to follow through), and the plan itself (how realistic is it given your current situation?). If you're rated highly in all these dimensions and the person on the phone is a "mandated reporter", that's the only situation I can see which would cause them to involve others and get you help. My recommendation would be to call -- it's not a risky move unless you're in immediate danger.
saulmontag	Numbing out is a way to guard yourself from pain, which is a compassionate act -- even when it doesn't feel like one. Kept you in my thoughts throughout the day today.
saulmontag	I've been down that road before too and you're 100% right - starvation really does numb the other pain. But the fact that you're trying to numb the pain means you're still trying to take care of yourself at the core, subconscious level. You're trying to feel better by numbing the pain even as it seems like there's no way out. At the darkest edge of life, you're still fighting to make it more bearable. That urge to feel better is the key to getting out of this, but ultimately it's your choice. You can go down one road to its completion or you can keep relying on that self-preserving instinct to help you out of this. After a lot of physical pain and illness resulting from not eating, I eventually chose the second route, and it legit felt like being saved from drowning. A giant rush of air to the lungs, painful, but alive. If even part of you hopes to feel that way some day again I hope you try. I know it's so much easier said than done, but I'm sending real and tender care your way whichever choice you choose.
saulmontag	Wow, this is stunningly accurate! I'm very hopeful and this new potential relationship has shook me out of dwelling on failed relationships of the past. I'm also likely way more interested/focused on it than he is since we're in very different life stages (he's older and has career to worry about, i'm young and unattached), but we did have a night of undeniable connection spiritually and physically that definitely has me thinking and might have us both wondering where this could go. Wait and watch is very sound advice -- it's what I've read in the cards each time I've asked for direction. I can tell why this is your fav relationship spread, you're great at interpreting it! This will be one of my go-to spreads for future readings too.
saulmontag	That's beautiful -- I love the look of repose on his face, too. Really captures the meaning of the hanged man!
saulmontag	Anyone want to take a stab at interpreting this romance spread? (More info in comments) | 
saulmontag	The left three cards represent me (king of cups, 6 of wands, the star), the right three represent him (chariot, hierophant, 8 of wands), and the center card is what unifies us (2 of cups -- again). Happy to answer any questions or try and give clarification when needed...just trying to get a second opinion on my read of it to make sure it's not too heavily biased :)
saulmontag	It's the wild unknown deck by Kim Kranz -- saw it and immediately fell in love :)
saulmontag	Aww, boo!  Some stores have even started carrying them, so it might be worth a couple calls around to places you think might have it!
saulmontag	Thank you!! I've been wondering about this particular person for the past few weeks. We had an amazing night together and -- for the first time in our long time of knowing each other -- really went deep and I came out of it with an intense connection to him, wondering if he felt the same or similar. His situation is more complicated though and I can see the hanged man symbolizing his need to think about things.
saulmontag	Yes, yes, and yes - thank you! I reshuffled shortly after this question, and when I asked the deck to give me guidance on how to handle the situation, I pulled the hanged man again. Patience is tough for me because I'm feeling pretty intensely for him right now, but if I keep that in check it might just pay off. 
saulmontag	Interpretation help needed with relationship reading, Hanged Man & 2 of Cups | 
saulmontag	The question was "how is he perceiving the potential for a relationship with me right now?"
saulmontag	I don't, really. The people who really know me (my therapist, my ex) tell me I'm capable of being a really great friend, but I just can't figure out how to make it work in real life. The fear of vulnerability is so strong and deeply ingrained that I often don't realize I'm not volunteering much about myself until after it's too late.  Like the other commenter said, I've been trying to go to Meetups and do some volunteer work. I also have a daily meditation practice which seems to help me build compassion for myself, which is always needed. Best of luck in finding what works for you and let me know if you discover the secret :)
saulmontag	Wow. I never put two and two together before. I have such bad posture I barely recognize myself when I walk past shop windows. Trying to pull my shoulders back and keep my chin up is a conscious effort and I never really thought about why before!   I used to curl up in a ball a lot, too. My cousin named the posture the 'Saul' fetus after me. That and the eating disorder, I totally see I was trying to make myself as small as possible.
saulmontag	I had the same problem with my practicum supervisor too...It took everything not to cry in the middle of her blunt criticism. Most people can probably just brush it off and know their worth doesn't depend on what someone else thinks, but I don't have that internal sense of worth so I take things much more personally.
thebad_comedian	I've Had A Death Wish For A While Now, And It's Just Gotten Worse. | I actually don't know why I'm telling anyone about this. Ever since my first depression scare back in seventh grade, I've always thought I was getting better. The feelings kinda faded out, and I generally internalised any desire to kill myself. I think that's because my mother started calling it emotional blackmail after about 3 months. She tends to put me down a lot. The thing is, no matter how much we argue, no matter how little self-worth she makes me feel, I still love her, and she loves me.   My death wish was just general, hoping for a truck to hit me, or a random heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. I wouldn't want to kill my self at all, I had a lot of hope, but I wouldn't have minded dying. I always lied on those depression questionnaires at the doctor's office, I had a feeling my mother would yell at me. But recently my life hasn't been going so perfectly. In certain areas, I'm fuckin golden, life is great, I'm actually on track for debate team leadership and I'm enjoying school somehow. But everywhere else just hurts. I've gotten worse at swimming after taking a month off, my grades are slipping in a few classes thanks to teachers who give about three assignments a month, and on good days I talk to people outside of my family circle. On bad day's I just get reprimanded for not being a top performer, and not being like the rest of the Indian community.   I hold my fingers up to my head and pretend it's a gun a lot. Try to fantasize about what it would feel like. I do it a lot around my mom. I just pretend I'm scratching an itch, she hasn't really commented on it. Frankly, I have conversations with myself inside my head when I'm swimming, or when I'm lonely; it tends to make me feel a bit better. Other times it makes me feel worse. I don't do anything to get more friends, or even to keep them, just because I fucked up back in seventh grade making me worry that doing anything would make it worse. Yesterday, I wanted to skip swimming, and then my mom told me that some friends of mine were ditching to go for a football game. She offered to take me, but I decided to go to swimming instead, mainly because that wouldn't involve as much interacting with people.   I wanted to become a comedian, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I also wanted to be a neurologist or neurosurgeon, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I've actually thought of how WWIII would give me a chance to enlist and die fighting, making me a little bit more useful. Then I realised I'm clearly insane to even imagine that.   I don't know how to end this. The post or my life, it's not like I have a gun or anything. I've heard that bleach often fails, and I don't want to risk that. So basically, my only effective method is jumping off the roof of my school or some other tall-ish building. God fucking dammit, I hate myself.
thebad_comedian	Just end up in a white-collar job. Or even a well playing blue, but a white collar will always outrank blue in my family's eyes. As for your first question, it's both. My mom isn't often wrong. She knows what I want to do in life, and while she may discourage some and encourage others, she knows that if she isn't an absolute helicopter, I'll never make it anywhere.
thebad_comedian	It's never like what my mom says about me isn't true. I never perform well, and I'm probably not going to do well on my own in life. I'm just puttering along pretending that I'm going to do fine, become some bigshot in life.

thebad_comedian	Alphonse Rodriguez was chosen to replace Ana Knyazev after the assassination of the [peace colony.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6nb3zs/_/dk8q6uj) This was not just a choice of hierarchy and belief that Rodriguez could act as a symbol of justice (he could, but that's not the point), but the personal endangerment he put himself through just to bring the Ops team commander in to justice. Rodriguez had stolen a gunship and flew it straight in to the blazing colony, willing to charge directly in to the now captured capitol alone, and after 15 grueling minutes of fighting brought the unconscious commander on his back. This heralded the end of the assault, and whatever citizens still alive could stand safe for evacuation.

What's worse is when they don't have a fucking clue on what they're talking about. At school, our English teacher was talking about how language and word meanings change over time. He started talking about "their" and how, over time, it went from being a plural to being also gender-neutral and singular. Then this kid blurts out "IS THAT BECAUSE OF SEXUAL THINGS AND SEX ACTIVITIES!?". Really? He's done this so many times during the year (Another example being "Jediphile" instead of pedophile, and then attempting to tell our teacher he's correct.). And it's only mid-September.

DiamondCreeper23	First, I'm not a furry.  Some people like that stuff. Like how some people like video games. I like playing video games. Furries like dressing as animals. I don't get the controversy against (most of) them. I understand how people hate the ones that force people to be furries or act like creeps in public.  Also remember, it's not always sexual. For some furries it's a hobby while for others it's a fetish. Same can be said about video games.

Definitely toppings (sprinkles, m&ms, and other small candies).

DiamondCreeper23	I was at the pool and a very young kid fell in the deep end without his life jacket. I yelled at the parents and lifted him out of the water (not onto solid ground as I wasn't strong enough to lift him more than a few inches out of the water) so his parents could come grab him.
DiamondCreeper23	Burger Shop. Weird, yet fun. The sequel on the other hand was terrible. Why do we need breakfast and lunch? It's a burger dinner based game!
DiamondCreeper23	When I was in 5th grade I threw my DSi onto the ground after losing against the final boss of Mario and Luigi: Bowsers inside story. How I got that far in the game is a mystery to me as I avoided most battles. Still have it and plan on getting it fixed soon. Dunno where though since Nintendo doesn't fix DSi's anymore...
DiamondCreeper23	Downstairs (I live in an apartment btw) neighbor is a jerk to all around her and will make any happy moment a sad one for her enjoyment. I come home after having an asthma attack and then later end up okay? Shoulda left me at school when I could barely breathe according to her. Which happened last week. I can see why her son has cut all contact with her. She also has a ton of cats that have attacked me before and yet I'm blamed for provoking them when all I was doing was sitting there.

DiamondCreeper23	My uncles fish. I already hate eating fish and somehow he made worse fish. Did throw up once and almost did a few more times.
DiamondCreeper23	I think I've decided how I (14m) might come out. How does it sound? | My plan to come out it that I come out to my best friend when I'm either at his house or he's at my house and we are alone. I plan on also asking him about his sexuality. Then, on Bi-visibility day I'll tell my parents. I'll try and go slow while I tell everyone so I don't basically throw a brick of truth at them.   From what I can tell, my best friend seems to be a supporter. He's also good at keeping secrets and I trust him to keep this a secret until I'm ready to fully come out to everyone.  I'm worried about telling my parents because although my mom and dad are supportive of the LGBT community, my stepfather doesn't seem to be much of a supporter. Any tips on telling someone who is possibly (not 100% sure) anti-LGBT?
DiamondCreeper23	What I say vs what Siri hears  "Hey Siri can you set an alarm for 9:30 am tomorrow?"  "Hey Siri all 30 A Toe."  
DiamondCreeper23	This girl I met in 6th who was the smartest in our class. I tried to ask her out but never did. I almost did at the graduation dance in 8th grade but ended up asking her how she was doing. I miss her and most likely won't see her ever again but oh well.  Edit: Just realized how young everyone else here had their crushes.
DiamondCreeper23	Scat, vore, diapers, blood, dead bodies, animals/fur, and feet. Seems weird but people like them.

DiamondCreeper23	That you shouldn't download pirated games and play them using emulators or stream movies.
DiamondCreeper23	Fish. It tastes the same way my fish tank smells if I don't clean it for a while. I've tried to eat it multiple times but I can't stand it's taste, no matter who cooks it or what fish it is, it tastes disgusting to me.
DiamondCreeper23	Yup.
DiamondCreeper23	Splatoon Weapons. I'd paint them in my free time and maybe even make some of them usable. Like the Splat Rollers.
DiamondCreeper23	Andi Mack. It's surprisingly good for a Disney Channel sitcom.
DiamondCreeper23	When I was younger I had [Kawasakis Disease](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease). I was like 3 or 4 so I barely remember it. My mom had taken me to 5 different doctors and they all just diagnosed me with small things like strep throat or a cold. I couldn't open my mouth because it would hurt too much, could barely walk, and everything was always spinning. According to my parents, I had bloodshot eyes and was extremely pale. Finally my parents and grandmother went to the doctors and demanded they do some tests. I then was properly diagnosed and got a ton of shots in my foot. I remember being wheeled out of the hospital in a wheelchair.  Edit: Removed some unnecessary things.
DiamondCreeper23	Claimed he would murder me in my sleep after trying to stab me. Made sure I went to sleep after him. 
DiamondCreeper23	While the privacy is nice, I have no one to do anything with unless I have friends over. My parents Andrew stepfather don't get video games much. It can get lonely after a while especially when my parents have to leave for a while to go do something. There isn't anyone to talk to other than my dog at times.  Edit: I do have step-siblings except they are all in their late 20's to mid 30's and live 1-2 hours away.
DiamondCreeper23	The time I got a 39/40 on a science quiz while the two smartest kids got a 35/40. Still, I ended up with a 2.7 GPA while they got 4.0s.
DiamondCreeper23	A lot of crying. Mainly from my mom, me, and my youngest cousin. It was my grandmother and I still miss her.
DiamondCreeper23	Dirty on the left and clean on the right. My mom always did it that way and so when she started making me wash the dishes I just did it the same way as her. Left to right.
DiamondCreeper23	Recently, I've convinced my stepfather to start drinking Mountain Dew instead of beer. 
DiamondCreeper23	I don't know why but I prefer 2 over 3.
DiamondCreeper23	I'm actually not sure what happened to her after she left. According to her family on Facebook she died of cancer but it actually might be fake. My dad ended up fine after it all luckily.
DiamondCreeper23	Was texting my mom if she could pick me up from my dad's house ending it with an "I love you!". This was before I had my own phone and so I was using my dads phone and ended up sending it to my uncle who lives in Wisconsin(I'm in California). He said it may take a while to get there as a joke response.
DiamondCreeper23	My dad was on some medicine that made him act weird (was prescription for diabetes) plus the fact that my stepmother was putting random medicines in his drinks made him break at night. He usually would go around yelling and breaking things and hitting me.   Today he's better and I usually go to see him. He changed completely. He acts the same way he did before he got all messed up.
DiamondCreeper23	Super Mario Bros. would look neat with a graphics and sound upgrade on the Switch. Could just recycle textures and models from Odyssey for a remake of SMB. Could say the same for 64 instead of SMB.
DiamondCreeper23	Star Wars movies, most superhero movies, and Indiana Jones movies.
DiamondCreeper23	Most shooter games (Splatoon series being an exception) and most RPGs that aren't turn based (Fallout series is another exception).
DiamondCreeper23	Phone, my skin, and (of course) the air.
throwawayforJJ	I'm done. I'm a worthless piece of shit. I don't want anyone dealing with my body when I die. What can I do? | (Apologies for this formidably long read. The rules state that I shouldn't ask for suggestion.I just want tell my story ,put it out here what I've been feeling for years.)  I would like to clarify at the outset that  I'm not writing this  out of impulse now. I've been planning my suicide for more than  a year now.  I'm 23 now, since I was 11/12 I've always felt I'm a misfit. I've always felt that I'm floating inside my body, I've no purpose in this world. I'm a loser, an evil incarnate, I can never be normal. I realized all this when I was 14/15.Throughout my school and college years ,I've been faking everything-smile,friendship,happiness,etc., Others don't know the face underneath the mask I put on. I've had it enough, I couldn't do the same at work,one day I just came to home without informing anyone at work.And when they tried to contact me ,I avoided itI was terminated. I lied to my friends that I got job in another city.For the past 18 months,I have been lying to them,while planning my suicide.   I got hold of sleeping pills.I just want to end it and cause minimal harm to my family. I don't want them to find my body because this is just traumatic , hell it would be great if they didn't even know I was dead and just went missing.  I always imagined I would get to a place like those deserts in Breaking bad  TV series and commit suicide. sometime I wish  someone would just kill me and dump in a place like that.alas, I live in third world country, I don't know if there are any such places here.   I'm saying all this so that you  would understand where I am coming from and the  suicidal thoughts I have been having since childhood feeling  like a waste of space.So PLEASE don't try to convince me not to, I've heard it all before and it wont help. hell its probably just like what it was like before I was born - nothing - and compared to the pathetic life I live that sounds great to me.  please help me.PM me your ideas.Help this world by getting ridding of me. 
myotirious	It didn't get better after seeing a therapist. On the contrary it made it worse. | People often told me to see a therapist and get some anti-depressent drug to deal with the fucking depression I had for years now. So I did.  Facing my inner depression for the first time in a long while instead of shutting away made me realize that all along, I just want to die. Like fuck it, if something were to happen to me I really don't care now because I really just want it to end. I'm not sad, I'm just tired and angry at having to follow this stupid rule set upon by modern day people, all the socializing, all the untold rules that I break every so often without realizing it.  And now comes the worst time in my life, when I was studying I wished I was working so I can escape studying, having something to look forward to, but now that I'm forced to look for a work and having no replies for weeks while having my family judge me in addition to my therapist not being available for weeks I just cant.   I really just want to die. Its not wrong having this desire because I never asked to be born in the first place. 
myotirious	Yesterday I fell asleep imagining  the world inside my head where everyone is waving and me and I realize that I never really belong here. I cried for the first time in months knowing I can never escape this place but instead I'm forced to live my life day after day after day after day after day all the while knowing I have to live not for myself, but for others. I could just take a short leap off the railway and end it. 
myotirious	How Trickle Down Economy Actually Works | 
myotirious	To add to this, get it from lazada with lazada fulfilled option, you'll get it after the monday holidays.
myotirious	Cool. Its funny reading how as China continues to modernize its factory with more automation with stuff like in the video happening, people in the west still equates china with low wage and hazardous practice.
myotirious	As much as people highlight the benefit of custom rom most users simply wont ever change their rom or in my case, got tired of having to fix broken stuff or reflash thing with every other release so I just stick with what works. And miui works.
myotirious	It seems like the budget redmi have sd slot while the more expensive mi and note is a hit and miss. The mix simply follows all the other flagship trend of omitting the sd slot. Does make media transfer a pain in the  ass. 
myotirious	Thank God xiaomi still has an sd card slot. 
myotirious	Using a xiaomi and it runs for hours for me without issue. Its more accurate than google map when it comes to navigating city streets.
myotirious	Oh sorry, I just read that as android auto. I don't use it my bad apologies. I simply tether mine to a cradle and use it like that.
myotirious	Basically an ad for your listing. 
myotirious	Its probably easier to keep tegra updated when they have so few of them to keep track of compare to qualcomm array of stuff. Once they reach the number of chips as qualcomm who knows how good of an update schedule they'll keep.
myotirious	Lol. The only reason it would ask for a pin if you set it in the first place 
myotirious	lol.
myotirious	Here's a salib - - - > t  And now I'm going to appear in the newspapers. 
myotirious	Call them and ask about it or email them. From cases I've seen usually they send the invoice very quickly. This is a bit long for a week worth of wait. 
myotirious	The real procedure depends on your shipping company. They'll send you an invoice that requires you to email/fax them or they already know how much they want to charge you. There's an agent fee for going with them either dhl/poslaju and other company like that but it's better to pay the agent fee than try to deal with kastam yourself. 
myotirious	Nvidia had always been more anticompetitive than its rival by releasing proprietary stuff and locking stuff up from being able to be access by its competitor's gpu. This is probably an extension of that policy.
myotirious	Ofc the people in power don't want the power to change hands. Typical. Even Japan government who held on for decades lost their government years back. 
myotirious	Imminent eminent domain incoming to your local neighbourhood soon!
myotirious	Did you forget the /s?  This is reddit after all.
myotirious	Ye. The chinese believe its better to have a country on some level of infrastructure because that means they get to sell them even more goods. Sure its capitalism but I like this more at least because it at least gives some opputunities back to the locals.  For the record they built trains in my country, direct copy of siemen and other company's trains but they work well enough.
myotirious	But hey more reason for the US to keep boots on the ground and keep their war economy going if there's a threat they can tangalize without it having a central command!
myotirious	Actually my country had a project done by the chinese as well. Its true that they prefer to fly in their own people during construction but the post construction job and everything is entirely local, they just train the worker first.  I think it's probably to give their higher educated people jobs or to otherwise build dependence upon chinese expertise. There's always  those little tactics.
myotirious	Maybe I should really stop commenting, its like the third time this week someone jumped on me and said I know nothing simply because I only provided one example instead of me just being lazy. Anyways, have a nice day to you.
myotirious	 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ [HEY LOOK I CAN DO A SHRUG EMOJI WOO]  &nbsp;  I still remember the Crysis 2 tessalation that heavily slow down AMD card that cant do it very well while Nvidia card have no issue whatsoever with it. So I would peg them as anticompetitive.   Actually if the problem is with my wording which I think it is, I was looking for word that means a company that don't wanna share stuff and a lot of secretive than usual.
myotirious	They had their chance with games for windows live, which they absolutely fucked it up.
myotirious	One BIG tip for you. BUY A FUCKING HAT. And a summer jacket too while you're at it. The weather change from scorching to humid scorching to sudden heavy downpour whenever it feels like it.
myotirious	The biggest problem with games for windows live was how damn buggy the whole thing and unnecessary integration they put into it. Stuff like having your save files be tied to your profiles which fucks you over if you're using local saves because even if you toss the save files into the right directory it won't get detected if you're using a different profile.   The other thing was it scans the game code [iirc] at launch which stops you from using cheats and modification to the game because it will just crash the game on purpose or otherwise pull the original value from somewhere. And since it's integrated so tightly into the game any issue with GFWL will fuck you over from playing the game itself until the issue was fixed while pirates can play the actual game without issues.  Then they drop support for it like a sack of hot shit leaving so many games unsupported unless the developer ported it back. Red Faction Guerilla with GFWL lags like hell while the steam version runs at 60 fps for me.
myotirious	You run into the issue of compatibility with some games that rely on old proprietary extension that is mostly unsupported on linux too. With windows you at the very least can still run legacy mode for them.
myotirious	Oh I fucking hate this guy. He felt like a cheap coward wearing a detective badge while spouting about things he doesn't know about. Justice, protecting people, and other shit that basically contradicts himself.  This probably blew up when he died and became even worse with constantly trying to dodge out of actually doing the things he said he would do.  A [well played] disgraceful character in my eye.  
myotirious	Fuck off little shit.
myotirious	I really don't like Salvador as a character. The entire premise of the character messed up my internal tick tock rhythm and I can't fit him in anything based on his action. Ultimately I decide not to care about this one.
myotirious	Pheonix yes pheonix, I had a few suspicious back when we first started about her nature but none of it was correct. I find the laws that restricts her was a pain in the fucking ass for her to work with but I don't have much sympathy for her breaking all those rules that are in place.  Wish we could have speak more and find out just why she hates humanity. Perhaps, that her relationship with grace improved her somewhat.
myotirious	Who?
myotirious	Grace, she was.... attached to Pheonix. My only hope for her at the end was for them to be reunited in the virtual world together. She was young and full of potential and who can say in 10-20 years she won't turn out to be finer women than she is right now?   The attachment she shared with pheonix was believable with her finding out the circumstances of the event that lead to her current life, to her death, to her sister. Even if it was all for naught.
myotirious	B.W.TRENCH  I swear at the end of it all I was someone named Manly Conlin, heir to a vast fortune, and with a twin brother. Alas that wasn't true.  A hotheaded vigilante, not assassin as other would call me, he only did what he could throughout the game, from trying to find out the point system, to nagging Justice within the virtual world of her twisted morality, to finally offing myself.  True I did all of it with an ulterior motive but could you say the same about yourself? No not really you couldn't. The difference is I waved goodbye and stuck to my gun at the end of it all even when all my chips are off the table.   The final bet is my life.
myotirious	Where to begin, where to begin. Never trust anyone, especially when they have something to lose.   Ophelia had something to lose.  I never trusted her on the first day we met and my intuition came true when she broke into my room and attempted to kill me. I was glad of that however. Leaving aside me killing her and her husband bashing my skull in, it gave me new perspective on life.  We're dead, we're equal.  Only in death do we pay the toll we had in life.   With this belief I decided against being angry with her and attempted to work with her with the slim hope that we both get out of this virtual prison and get back to where our fleshbag self had stopped. Sadly, it was over for me, not for her.  I wish her best of luck in her new life.
myotirious	Danielle was a civilian who got caught up with something beyond her scope. I feel like she did not deserve to die in such a way.
myotirious	In a way I really like Cherry, she knows what the stakes are and she acted upon them going full on survival mode. We could argue that she takes some things to an extra length but it make sense in this case.  She murdered someone, adrenaline coursing through her vein and the ever threat of death looming before her. I don't quite understand her motivation for choosing that prize at the end of it but I suppose it's probably just me.
myotirious	If we had met in another time and another place I would have taken a seat and order a cuppa coffee and have a nice long chat with this gentleman. Unfortunately circumstances means that no matter what happens I cannot allow you to live if I can get out of this alive. Since that did not came to pass he gave his life up for others.  An interesting, dynamic, if I may somewhat hypocritical of himself where he makes endless deals that suits himself and only himself which he probably knew when he made the deal. Advancing someone through a death game is the work of a madman, therefor I am somewhat he lost his motivation in the end.
myotirious	Neutral. It gave the players who died something worthwhile for them to think about. It does however build it up hype for the still living players who will assume they have another day. That's why it's neutral. Dead player get stuff, living player didn't die. 
myotirious	Hmph, the one who got away. *Salutes.*
myotirious	Did not interacted with him much, he had a few bright shining moment which lead me to believe his story of being a detective. Other than that I can't say much.
myotirious	Never interacted with him much. Sadly.
myotirious	You know its things like this that shows how bad our mentality regarding public ammenities are.
myotirious	Simply put it from what I seen of the advancement in AI most of the job in senior levels will be retain. AI will instead replace the lower level job and act as a secondary assistant helping to fetch and process data faster than humans can.  Here's an article about a japanese insurance company replacing it with AI. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/japanese-company-replaces-office-workers-artificial-intelligence-ai-fukoku-mutual-life-insurance  And I have no idea about accountancy AI sorry, I read a few being deployed in wallstreet and generating insane productivity compared to the old system. I'm under the opinion that self driving cars is what we should be worried more since it will happen in the next 10 years and with the tasker AI even more job will be made obsolete. Tasker AI delegates jobs it can't do to humans who can but at the same time it looks at how the human completes the task and then slowly learns how to do it itself.   That's very scary because while those few people currently have a job under the tasker they will soon be replace. 
myotirious	Its really a cascading effect, once more self driving car that can communicate with each other are on the road the more reliable and safer it gets because to them machine are a predictable element with measurable rating for every component and fuel stuff.  Human in a car are not so until the critical mass is reach it won't be as good as it should be. Besides humans are horrible drivers, why not give machine a chance.
myotirious	I always *love* it whenever us SEA region complaning about games costing over 200+ on release gets hijcked by westerners who always spout the same thing over and over again. "Yeah hurr durr but its 60 dollars equivalent so quit complaining its the same price as US."   Problem is, US pays everything else in their life cheaper than us in the first place and with videogames costing only 60 dollars for them on a probably 900 wage a month [example] they still have 840 to spend stuff on. PS4 and 3DS consoles are several hundred dollars and a good laptop can be had for 800 dollars.  Meanwhile on a minimum wage of 1100 we have to pay 200+ for the latest games. Our consoles starts at 1k minimum, and a good equivalent laptop is 3000 not to mention the higher cost of living in general. So yeah we do get to complain when company does direct USD to whatever money we're using because to be honest pirating is way easier and cheaper too.
myotirious	Just because you earn more doesnt mean you're any less toxic. Anedoctal but I know a few wealthy friends who smash their tables or monitor after a particularly bad game, the only differences is they can replace it faster.
myotirious	https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6ojsbo/notifications_are_highly_reliable_except_when/dkidura/?context=3&st=j5enixnd&sh=7d018fc4
myotirious	Nah, while its true lower income correlates to lower education levels I'll hesitate before I agree with low income correlates to poor online behaviour because that's a subjective thing.
myotirious	True true, not saying they shouldnt fix the notification of course. Just making a good thing out of bad thing because I'm so lazy to actually disable it one by one.
myotirious	Yea, I kinda use the restrictive notification to my advantage because holy hell when i used a 'normal' stock rom theres so many useless notifications. Using MIUI helps me because I only need a few apps open for notifications.
myotirious	Been using MIUI for a year now. Rooted and tried custom rom before but went back because MIUI just works fine enough for me and I don't really like stock android looks. The notification stuff is non-issue  [to me, and only me when I use this statement.] because it only takes me 10 min to setup the notification for my 3 main usual application while it kills anything else I don't need in the background.
myotirious	Media Narrative: Consumers continue to be smart spender causing decline in retail industry.  Actual case: Consumer have no money due to greedy policies/behaviour by people on the top of the food chain. Also online shopping.
myotirious	I mean I'm an introvert, I would literally never go out shopping anymore if there's an app delivery for everything I need. But yeah it will definitely cause a collapse. Just look at this youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz4Un92pGNxQ9vNgmnCx7dwchPJGJ3IQ>  Where it shows what happens if consumer spending continue going down. Tons of dead mall.
myotirious	Maggie close to RM4 now wtf.
myotirious	Distracting from the actual issue which is class warfare. Simple.
myotirious	It's happening worldwide, not just in Malaysia. This is what happens when wage stagnation combines with shrinking middle class means the number of consumer who could afford to spend for luxury goods are decreasing as time goes on. Closing down factories only exaberates the problem as more people are laid off. Take a look at shopping mall around Malaysia and a lot are starting to have vacant lots that goes unrented for period of time as well.   And that is before automation hits the road causing even more massive unemployment.
myotirious	* Chinese player have been criticizing videogame maker about the lack of chinese language in videogames and they do so via review bombing or the proper game forum. As a result more games are incoporating chinese language translation.  * Paradox Interactive was criticize for raising the price of games in CIS region recently and was forced to rescind it.  * Valve paid mod debacle was criticized.  There you go, 3 easy example where videogame industry was criticized. And not via some drama thing I couldnt care less about. 
myotirious	Good, the last thing we need are more stories about people in the industry attacking each other. Why is this still a thing anyways.
myotirious	Yeap thanks, you paraphrase what I meant and then change the topic of what criticism you meant. Have a good day.
myotirious	LOL NO.  Especially when the anti-corruption agency don't have a free leash and everyone and their family is in the goverment.
myotirious	Its worse when you realize its not only muslim who speaks out that gets silenced here. Remember the news a few weeks back about priest who speaks out against the goverment and was accused of attacking islam itself [how? a goverment is not representation of a religion] and dissapeared a few days later.   Its especially damning in Syria because those foreign fighters sent to fight there are essentially mercenaries now because there is no single unified forces in syria while Daesh and its ilk send their fighter there for training. A miserable condition all around.  Agenda Yahudi was always a stupid excuse. While it is true that Mossad influnces thing the people who say that uses that as an excuse to further their goal instead of trying to improve the country to be on the same level as them so that we can compete. But no, they still use that to stir up local hate instead.
myotirious	Question for agnostic people do you lose faith in your religion seeing it being politicize? | This question is probably directed more towards agnostic muslims living in Malaysia. You see in news about how the way Malaysians are living isn't according to islamic principles and that some people are being pointed out as being heretics whenever they propose something radical.   Problem is it doesn't quite apply to the people proselytizing those things because you see unchecked corruptions going all over the stuff they're elected for, clerics who espouse islamic livings yet lives like king in their bungalow while going out to give talk. Or children left into religious school yet have to sell stuff at young age to make profit for the school itself.   When you look elsewhere at places where it is less zealous and where religion isn't quite made as brand like communism was back in the day don't you get kinda tired and lose a bit faith because the people who are said to protect and uphold your religion are the ones taking advantage of it yet saying the opposite.
myotirious	It's quite sad that while we are told to be a god fearing muslim the ones who told us that aren't god fearing itself.
myotirious	Oh another thing thats a bit unrelated is belief in these whole 'mystic' thing where you see high ranking officials wearing stones or 'tangkal' said to be able to protect from harm yet at the same time, call themselves a true muslim.
myotirious	My school was evil though, they put the aircon for high performing class only =w=  The not so smart student all have to look with envy at those motherfuckers while all we have are fans.
myotirious	I'll just mentioned that having gone to a chinese school as a non-chinese, they have far far better emphasize on english and science stuff learning than kebangsaan school and being privately funded some could afford to have a full [single] classroom of pc lab.   its the reason I am able to shitpost on online forum, glare at the chinese people talking shit bout me in front of me and fail my mathemathic and science. Jokes aside the racism is real but if I had to choose I rather go to chinese school because they open up a better mindset than Kebangsaan school and its propaganda. Form 5 sejarah was the worst.
myotirious	Eh my bad on that part. Although from my time there everything from the big new hall, the computer, new library and shit like that are all from the parent donation card they did yearly.
myotirious	In Malaysia Fishmonger Starts Passing Off Deadly Pufferfish As Other Fish Type To Increase Profit. | 
myotirious	Sure no prob. Thanks.
myotirious	Do you mind scanning it if you happen to have the chance?

myotirious	That probably wont happen however, the queen and the royal system of britian itself iirc are a a group of landowner collecting rent to sustain themselves.
myotirious	If a map is built on a central landmark that you can see I get how that can work but when you're literally running around all over the place you just have to keep opening the damn map. 
myotirious	Opulent | 
myotirious	And just last week iirc the US army just admitted they accidentally killed 500 people in Iraq, 500 pissed off people who just lost a family member. And people wonder why terrorism is so prevalent.
myotirious	Oh but my dear friend. Think of all those jobs you'll cut away if you reduce military spending. It's not like you want better health care, infrastructure, and some part of the world not hating you no like a damn socialist? /s
myotirious	Oh no venezuela. I'll just wait for the others to do the argument.
myotirious	If they retaliate they suffer even more destruction and justifying razing their country. If they do nothing they can only watch as their country is rule by a puppet goverment and any and all attempt at reform will only bring cia in.   If they had been left alone without western intervention they would have prospered. Just look at pictures of the old middle east before the whole invasion happened.  P/S: Sorry about the source.
myotirious	To back it up I tried looking back through reddit but it seems the thread is already gone from my frontpage, so I have no way to dig up info atm. Using google gives me info from last month but thats 105 dead not 500. Sorry to dissapoint you.
myotirious	...... what happened to indiegala, their website is horrible now. I haven't been there in a while but their menu is now on the left side with auto playing gif on mouseover.
myotirious	Care to share?
myotirious	Anybody know how they watermark that picture and name? Looks pretty interesting and unusual. Never seen a beehive style watermark before.
myotirious	Oh my dearest Dune, how I am enamored with you as I watch you struggle from your weekly existence in order to give life to the void that is in our heart. How despite multitude of setback and weekly insanity that drives your sleep to the edge of insanity and beyond you still persevere, such dashing and manly fortitude that puts all other male to shame. *swoon*  You are the host that I never thought I would ever meet in my life, the host who defies all expectation and all through the end of it all you break the very rules of your moral fiber to let us set our wings free and the one last resolution.   I find you never wanting, your patience, your skills, and your skills in putting letter to papers have won me over, take me you beautiful beast.
myotirious	Pretty good.
myotirious	Honestly its steam community what do you expect? Most of the discussion there quickly turn into flaming war. Best to just ignore it.
myotirious	Wonder who patched the exe then, either it was bethesda or GOG. Could be GOG since having these games will boost visibility and they already done it a few times before.
myotirious	yes I did read the article, it also mentions that its a first time denuvo phone home this much which is the surprising part because its knowingly affecting performance.
myotirious	But does it get better performances? All these new denuvo cracked games still have denuvo in them just that the triggers are blocked.
myotirious	How about link showing the opposite that Denuvo does affect performances while not including Rime? You will find far more debunking it than supporting.
myotirious	Hmm, thats a first then. It didnt affect much performance before but why would they put so much trigger in it knowing performance would be affected.
myotirious	They were definitely burned hard by the wii u especially since I read that first batch of wii u was still on the shelf when they cancelled it. They really want to avoid a repeat of last time.
myotirious	Nope, the report I read mentioned that they made a HUGE stock thinking it'll sell like hotcakes but it didnt, that was why wii u production could end early because theres still so many stock.
myotirious	Do you know how fucking it is to find proper mental healthcare in this fucking country? I tried killing myself times because I could never get treatment for my chronic depression. Plus I lost all respect for therapist in this country when the one time I went to a therapist they went and told my family all about my conditions. Motherfucker.
myotirious	Fucking precisely. My friend who went for a depression checkup was told to deal with and that aiya it's just headache ah. Go fuck yourself mental health care malaysia. 
myotirious	On the other hand it also means some games cant get updated if they happen to have any bugs after shipping because there's no easy way to patch it.  The accessibility of patching goes 2 ways nowadays.
myotirious	It doesnt really matter since Geely own Volvo along with all their expertise.
KeybladesChosen	I don't deserve a painless suicide. I deserve to hurt. | Title pretty much sums it up. I'm a disgusting coward whose whole life has centered around avoiding pain and conflict. I always play things safe because I'm terrified of risk taking.   I never invite people out or try to build friendships with acquaintances because I'm afraid of being shot down. I never go on social media because I can't handle the pain of seeing others have dynamic social lives. I dont exercise enough because of how much it hurts.   Bottom line is I'm a fucking spineless pussy who will never get the body or social skills he wants. I have nothing to offer the world because ive run away from it for so long. I think I should kill myself in the most brutal way possible to make sure that I experience all of the pain that I was too weak to handle in life.   I had a sheltered upbringing, no abuse or traumatic experiences, my parents pay for me to piss away my time at college so I dont even have financial stress. I have had a laughably easy life and yet I'm still overwhelmed and miserable. Realistically I should have died long ago.   I'm 20 years old now, an adult child, and I think its too late to fundamentally change myself into a brave person who can go after what he wants. I fled from pain for my entire childhood, I want to experience true pain at least once before I die. Any ideas for a super painful method would be appreciated. Thanks.

KeybladesChosen	Tired of feeling inferior. How can I unf**k myself physically. | When I was a kid my parents never let me play sports. Once I got to high school I wanted to learn but I was so terrible at everything that no one would play with me. Now I'm in college and there's lots of cool martial arts and recreational things I want to try out but I'm too embarrassed about my abysmal strength, stamina and coordination.  I tired of being a pathetic shut in video game addict who can't have fun outside with normal people. I need to fix myself and make up for all the years I wasted as a kid. Is there any way to do this?  Some stats if you're interested: M20, 6'1", 165 lbs. Cant run for more than a mile. Cant row a 2K in under 9 minutes, cant do more than 30 pushups, can't shoulder press more than 50 lbs, can't squat more than 100lbs, cant hold a plank for longer than 90 seconds, cant do anything without sweating profusely (that might be an unrelated medical problem though)  If you have any suggestions for me I thank you in advance.
KeybladesChosen	In tired of being inferior. Is it too late to unf**co my body? | Hey all, I'm on my 5th week of noFap and so far have felt nothing. I'm no more confident, no less lonely, and girls still act like I'm invisible. I think that my shitty body and how much I hate it is the biggest obstacle towards progress. I want to be in shape but I'm terrified because I go to an athletic school and everyone is leagues ahead of me.  When I was a kid my parents never let me play sports.

KeybladesChosen	Starting over from nothing | Long story short, depression fucked my first few years of college up big time. I planned on committing suicide on my twentieth birthday a few months ago so I completely isolated myself from others, deleted all social media, and intentionally acted like an asshole to friends and aquaintences so they wouldn't feel bad when I died. Unfortunately I wasn't able to go through with it even though it was probably the right thing for a loser like me to do. I threw away my helium the next day because I didnt want to be reminded of how I was too much of a pussy to even end myself.   I had to withdraw from my last college due to multiple breakdowns so now I'm stuck at a new school in a new state with a new major. Basically I've lost all progress in life and am back to square one. I've spent the last month trying to force myself to be optimistic about this so I'm not reconsidering suicide just yet, but the loneliness here is literally crushing me. I swear whenever I see a happy couple or a laughing group of friends on campus I feel literal pain in my chest.   I'm stuck in classes with lots of freshmen but they all bonded over orientation events while I was just chucked in here with nothing. I'm a weak piece of shit so sports or a fraternity is out of the picture. I just don't see any way to fight this. I am 20 years old but I feel like I have the social skills and wherewithal of a 14 year old starting high school. Is there a way to redeem myself at this new school where nobody knows me and nobody seems to want to? Has anyone dealt with a total reset like this before?

KeybladesChosen	Starting over at life. How can I not hate myself? | First time poster on this sub. I'm 20 years old now and feel like ive made no progress in life. Depression took everything good out of my life and right before a suicide attempt a few months ago I burned all my bridges. Long story short, I have no friends, no good hobbies, and little hope of ever finding a girlfriend. I've moved to a new city, started at a new university, got on some new psychiatric meds and I think I'm ready to reboot my life.I have already gone cold turkey on alcohol, porn and video games. Ive been feeling a little better the past month but when I look around and see all of the driven, motivated, charismatic and beautiful people who surround me I can't help but feel useless. I don't really have anything great to offer a new friend or a potential partner and I see no reason for someone to choose me over the thousands of other people at this school. I feel outmached by all the people who didnt spend the last 5 years in depression induced isolation. I would appreciate any advice you guys have for a super insecure, socially awkward skinny guy to get his life on track. Thank you.

KeybladesChosen	I wish the girls at my school wore more clothes. | My depression has made it so everything in the world is dull. The only thing that gives me any semblance of emotion is seeing all the beautiful girls on campus. I wish I didnt have to see them because the feeling of awe and excitement I get is immediately followed by the deepest feelings of guilt and despair knowing how lowly I am compared to them and how I will never experience the joy of love and sex.   I know this sounds like a stupid thing to complain about, but I just moved to a big city university and its so frustrating seeing thousands of drop dead gorgeous girls every single day and having to force myself with every ounce of willpower I have not to stare at them. I was that creepy kid in high school and I don't people to hate me here for being weird and staring. Im not attractive enough for hookups or social enough for a relationship so constantly seeing the beauty I can never obtain is depressing beyond belief. It wouldnt be so bad but they all wear such skimpy and revealing clothes. Super short shorts that show off perfect legs, tank tops with the bottom half cut off and bra straps hanging out the side, low cut shirts and tops that frame their incredible cleavage, they all make it so hard to ignore. I know that people have the right to dress however they want and the girls that dress like that probably enjoy the attention they get (from hot guys, not me obviously) but I really wish that I wasnt reminded of how much of a collosal failure I am every time I walk across campus. I'm a loser virgin who never has even been invited to a party and hot college girls might as well be a different species. I don't deserve to be here, I just want to disappear and hide away until I forget what love is. Then I wouldnt have to hate myself for not getting any of it.

KeybladesChosen	They didnt do him justice in the main game. The Brotherhood episode that shows his struggles with loneliness and trying to lose weight made him much more emotionally compelling.
KeybladesChosen	Kill myself to spare my family the pain of watching me fail. | M/20, going back to college in a few weeks. My family keeps encouraging me, telling me that everything will be different this time. They are certain ill be able to make friends, stay healthy, get good grades, find internships and jobs and fend for myself. They all have so much confidence in me and I can't bear for them to see how the child they put so much hope in will turn out in 5 or 10 years.   If I kill myself now they will be sad, but they will at least be able to say I had a bright future ahead. Their faith in who I was as a person wouldn't be taken away. I probably had the potential they talk about at some point but depression has eaten away at it and left a it a hollow shell, a weak facade of the potential for a meaningful existence.   I really dont want them to see me break down into self harm again, to watch as I piss away thousands of dollars on drugs and therapy only to never improve. I don't want them to look at me as a failure when I wash out school because of depression induced exhaustion, or when I have to be homeless because I have no friends I could share a home or apartment with. I don't want to see the look of dissapointment on their face when they finally realize they will never have grandkids because their son is a awkward loser who cant talk to girls. I don't want them to look at me when I turn into a bitter, ugly man, gaining in weight and diminishing in job options. I don't want my family to see me live out the bleak future I see for myself every time I close my eyes.   My past is so much brighter than my future. If I die now, not only will I be free from the shitshow my life is going to become, but my parents won't have to live with the guilt and shame of spawning such a disgusting parasite. I've put up a guise of competence and ambition for them for years, making them believe that I could follow through on my dreams. But the future will soon tear down that flimsy disguise. The only way to preserve it, to protect everyone's memories of me is to make sure that for me that future never arrives.  I would rather have my death be seen as a tragedy than my whole life be considered one.
KeybladesChosen	Rohan would be vulnerable to a sneak attack since he would have to directly show Batman his drawing in order to disable him. I don't think Heaven's Door gives increased reflexes or reaction time so Batman should be able to use stealth and knock him out.
KeybladesChosen	I'm pretty sure Bites the Dust only works on human (or at least fully sentient) beings though. Otherwise wouldnt Stray Cat have gotten blown up when Hayato attacked Kira with it?
KeybladesChosen	Does Heaven's Door work on non-humans? Can Kira create bombs out of things larger than his staff's total range?
KeybladesChosen	[Casual] Godzilla (modern) once again attacks Japan, but his first target is Morioh. Can the stand users band together to defeat him? | Any character good or bad from JoJo part 4 (or 8 of you prefer alternate universe). Godzilla doesnt need to be killed, only repelled before the city is destroyed.
KeybladesChosen	Exactly, if we lived in an even remotely fair world I wouls have been dead long ago and never given a second chance. The fact that I would rather die than suffer through the pain and boredom of the jobs available to me suggests that there is something inherent to my personality that makes me incompatible with the real world. It makes sense to me that I should find a way to die as soon as possible to reduce the burden I put on all those around me.
KeybladesChosen	People without value. | In your guys' worldview, what is the fate of those who cannot provide enough value to society to afford food and other necessities. I struggle with depression and anxiety and it has kept me from going to school, getting a full time job and moving out of my parents house. As a 20 year old, out of shape, emotional trainwreck I have no value in the economic, social or sexual marketplace.   These issues are my fault as I was lazy and spoiled as a teenager and never developed a work ethic or coping mechanisms. I played too many video games and became dependant on constant stimulation that makes the tedium of work unbearable. Because of these things no private charity would ever consider me deserving of aid. Is there any recourse for a worthless parasite like myself that doesnt rely on harming or exploiting others (like using the power of the state to steal resources for SS or welfare). Should I accept the punishment for my poor decisions and turn down any undeserved assistance (condemning myself to a slow death by starvation or a quick one by suicide)?   How would you guys address this moral issue of people like myself who simply failed to develop any abilities that could provide value or who lived purely for immediate gratification?
KeybladesChosen	Sounds like its over for me. If I could compete in the world as it is I wouldn't have ended up as such s sack of shit. I guess there cant be any winners without losers.
KeybladesChosen	I'm Afraid... | Hey there TRP. I'm one of the Nice Guys that the internet constantly attacks. I dont get any happiness from normal things like exercise, parties or spending time with friends. My only good quality is my willingness to help others and be kind to those in need. I just want to live a quiet life and do my part to help the world, but I know that I'm fighting a losing battle against biology. Deep down I know that I will never be satisfied with my life unless I can get an attractive gf (not like a model, just someone who weighs less than I do).   I'm currently in college and see amazing girls every single day. It hurts me to know that because of my depression, social anxiety, and all the video games I played as a teenager instead of exercising, that I have nothing to offer them. There are hundreds of thousands of jocks, frat boys, and ambitious entrepreneurs who are more than willing to take all of the girls and I feel that its too late for me to start to compete.   I'm afraid that even if things miraculously get better for me in terms of my finances and mental health, I will have to live out the rest of my life filled with bitterness and regret that I will never satisfy my most basic, instinctual desire. Is this fear rational, is it too late for a 20 year old Nice Guy virgin loser to turn his life into something worth continuing?
KeybladesChosen	Poor Narancia, being dragged into this stupid debate. He deserved better.
KeybladesChosen	I can't cut it in the real world, I think suicide is the right choice for me. | I believe that I need to die because I am lazy and have no value. If any of you can logically convince me that my non-productive existence should continue I wouls appreciate it. My logical mind is trying to kill me and I feel such guilt For ignoring it and not ending myself.  For the past year I have been unable to physically or mentally handle the exhaustion of a full-time menial job. My depression and anxiety drain all my energy and make it a battle just to get up in the morning. As a result, I am now 20 years old and far behind my peers in terms of accomplishments and life experience. I currently am unable to work more than 25 hours a week and most of the rest of the time I spend asleep or in a depressive slump. In short, I'm making less than $200 a week and not properly preparing for any future career or education development. I currently live with my parents but it won't be long before I get kicked out and have to cheat my way onto some kind of government assistance since I cant deal with a second job and cant survive on my current salary.  I might be able to get disability for my depression, but since tens of millions of people are able to work full time with depression there isnt much moral justification for me needing it. Whatever the origins of my issues, they manifest as the worst, most unforgivable type of laziness.  It seems like for the foreseeable future I am going to be taking more away from society than I am giving. Essentially, I will be leeching off of the hard work of millions of people who grew up with far less privilege than me (I'm white, male and supported by middle class parents). Is there any moral justification for such reprehensible parasitism?  I'm not suggesting that those on government assistance don't deserve help, but I believe I am a unique case since the general consensus has been that my issues are all "fixable" and therefore I bear the moral responsibility of my sloth and failure to work hard. I have tried therapy and medication but nothing seems to assuage my lethargy and low motivation; perhaps my fundamental character is the problem. If this is true, then I am fundamentally someone who enslaves others and steals resources from future generations.  My life cannot have any value high enough to make up for such avarice. I am a drain on those around me, so if all human life is considered to have equal value then I am obligated to kill myself for the greater good.  Is there any flaw in my reasoning here? The principles I believe in right now tell me I must die to benefit society and atone for my parisitic lifestyle. Before anyone asks, I don't have any qualifiable outside of my meager economic contribution. I have no friends who would miss me if I disappeared, I'm unattractive and thus have no sexual market value, and I'm not talented or driven enough to make creative contributions to the world. While there is a chance that these factors might change, to consume society's resource on such slim odds seems immoral since there are other, more deserving young people they could go to.  I think the odds of me finding a job that I can tolerate emotionally and support myself on are so low that suicide is the only rational choice. I don't want to hurt my family but I think it would be better for them to mourn for the future I could've had then to be shamed by the failure ill almost certainly become.  Thanks for reading, any advice or sympathy is appreciated

For the past year I have been unable to physically or mentally handle the exhaustion of a full-time menial job. My depression and anxiety drain all my energy and make it a battle just to get up in the morning. As a result, I am now 20 years old and far behind my peers in terms of accomplishments and life experience. I currently am unable to work more than 25 hours a week and most of the rest of the time I spend asleep or in a depressive slump. In short, I'm making less than $200 a week and not properly preparing for any future career or education development. I currently live with my parents but it won't be long before I get kicked out and have to cheat my way onto some kind of government assistance since I cant deal with a second job and cant survive on my current salary.   I might be able to get disability for my depression, but since tens of millions of people are able to work full time with depression there isnt much moral justification for me needing it. Whatever the origins of my issues, they manifest as the worst, most unforgivable type of laziness.   It seems like for the foreseeable future I am going to be taking more away from society than I am giving. Essentially, I will be leeching off of the hard work of millions of people who grew up with far less privilege than me (I'm white, male and supported by middle class parents). Is there any moral justification for such reprehensible parasitism?  I'm not suggesting that those on government assistance don't deserve help, but I believe I am a unique case since the general consensus has been that my issues are all "fixable" and therefore I bear the moral responsibility of my sloth and failure to work hard. I have tried therapy and medication but nothing seems to assuage my lethargy and low motivation; perhaps my fundamental character is the problem. If this is true, then I am fundamentally someone who enslaves others and steals resources from future generations.    My life cannot have any value high enough to make up for such avarice. I am a drain on those around me, so if all human life is considered to have equal value then I am obligated to kill myself for the greater good.  Is there any flaw in my reasoning here? The principles I believe in right now tell me I must die to benefit society and atone for my parisitic lifestyle. Before anyone asks, I don't have any qualifiable outside of my meager economic contribution. I have no friends who would miss me if I disappeared, I'm unattractive and thus have no sexual market value, and I'm not talented or driven enough to make creative contributions to the world. While there is a chance that these factors might change, to consume society's resource on such slim odds seems immoral since there are other, more deserving young people they could go to.  Let me know what principles you would apply to my situation. Am I correct in deducing that suicide is the moral answer in this scenario to minimize the suffering of myself and others. No platitudes please, I need logic right now.

KeybladesChosen	I'm a hugless, kissless, hand-holdless, phone numberless virgin who... | ...lives with his parents, has droopy eyes and no muscle mass, suffers from depression, social anxiety and agoraphobia, has wasted most of my 20 years of life playing video games, and whose main hobby is sleeping to escape the pain of my friendless existence. Im every unattractive male stereotype rolled up into one hideous abomination of a subhuman. My laziness and fear of leaving my comfort zone have left me paralyzed throughout high school and now I'm years behind my peers in terms of work and life experience.        Every time I see a pretty girl or a hot guy in public I die a little inside imagining all the crazy, fun and sexy things they've surely done with their friends and SOs. I always get mad at myself whenever I catch myself thinking romantic thoughts about girls I see (irl or on tv) because I know I'm the last guy any of these strong, beautiful and amazing women want desiring them.       My shitty decisions have ruined my chances at life and because of my sheltered upbringing I lack the toughness and willpower to change things. I will never experience love or friendship the way real people do. I will never be anymore than a background figure in people's lives, no more significant than a decorative lamp or a table. At least a table doesnt beak down whenever weight is put on it.      Is there any way to redeem myself when I've failed this much? Would it be better if I just killed myself and free up the excesssive resources I consume rather than wait until I'm homeless and starving in a gutter in 5 years. Thanks for reading, I dont deserve your sympathies.

KeybladesChosen	How hot does a guy have to be for you to want to hook up with him? | Pretty self explanatory. Just wondering what kind of physical features a guy can have that will make you interested in sex without knowing much about his personality.
KeybladesChosen	I'm the guy that no one wants to be... | Hello SW. New poster here. My 20th birthday is in less than a month and I dont want to be alive to see it. I don't think I can handle seeing the end of my teen years with nothing to show for it. I was the always the good, straight edge kid growing up, and I've grown in the the classic "nice guy" that the internet despises. My middle class parents sheltered me from the world and wouldnt even let me play sports when I was found. As such I am now a weak, cowardly, lazy piece of shit with no work ethic and a disgusting skinny body that no girl would ever want to touch. I was bullied all throughout junior and high school because of a speech impediment I used to have and this has caused me to develop horrible depression and social anxiety. I haven't had a real friend in over 5 years, every since I moved to a new state in 9th grade.   I know that my problems aren't unique or unusual and that being a white male with a roof over my head already puts me above 90% of the world in terms of privilege, but I just cant live with who I am. I was a straight A honor student at a prestigious university and I thought that my intelligence and grades would be enough to save me from a life of isolation, wage slavery and boredom. I was wrong. Ive taken a leave of absence from school due to multiple suicide attempts and might never be allowed back in. I work a part time job right now and I can barely handle it. There's no way I can cut it in the real world working 40+ hours a week on top of cooking, cleaning, exercising and generally taking care of my self. I am a stimulation addict who grew up on porn and video games and I lack the willpower, discipline, and pain tolerance to change my life even though I've read thousands of pages of self help books and forums and know what needs to be done. I have choices in my life but as I approach my 20th birthday, my last birthday, I don't see any way forward that doesnt lead to embarassment, suffering, loneliness, decay and suicide. I hope there is some way I can make my family understand that I'm a lost cause, that the resources required to maintain my high-maintenance existence deserve to go to those less privileged, and that it is best for me to die now with some dignity than to die of frostbite or starvation on the streets 10 years down the road. I was given all the advantages in the world and I fucked it all up, I truly do not deserve to live on the same planet as you brave people.   Just for shits and giggles here's a picture of me. Roast away: http://imgur.com/a/wrDFY

KeybladesChosen	Getting anxious thinking about girls even though I know I don't have a chance. | How do I stop thinking about girls.  Pretty straightforward. I'm 19M in college right now so I'm surrounded all the time by smart, gorgeous girls. It sucks because I know that all of them are so far out of my league and that they have literally hundreds of better options so why would they ever give me a chance. I don't want to become bitter or desperate since I know that's unattractive so is there anyway I can stop thinking about relationships with these girls. Literally every time I have a conversation with one my mind starts racing and envisioning sex or a relationship. It's distracting, inconvenient, and oftentimes these thoughts make me really depressed since I know that these girls will never think about me in the same way. Does anyone else have this problem? How do you handle it and not let it affect your daily life?

KeybladesChosen	Didn't expect this topic to be so polar-izing. 
KeybladesChosen	Losing weight... | 19M in uni right now. I really want to gain weight (muscle obviously) so I can stop looking like a light breeze could crush me. However the only place I can afford to go to get food is the campus dining hall and I'm always too terrified to eat a full meal there. Either I sit with people I know and feel too uncomfortable to make conversation so I bail halfway through or I sit by myself in the corner surrounded by all the other quiet, friendless losers and just feel my self esteem get destroyed. I'm hungry all the time but the fear of having to eat alone and listen/see everyone else laughing and enjoying themselves just kills me. Anyone else been in a situation like this?
KeybladesChosen	I do that a lot. I feel that I have no right to be taking up their time with my worthless talking and that they will get bored/frustrated if I don't get it over with quickly
KeybladesChosen	Upvote for Kingdom Hearts
KeybladesChosen	Don't worry too much about how you were feeling in the hospital. Head or back injuries can cause unusual emotional responses. Its just your brain trying to assess any damage. When I got a concussion last year I spent about a day crying uncontrollably about tiny stuff (which is totally abnormal for me since I'm usually pretty stoic). You shouldn't take this experience as an accurate reflection of your true emotional state. Best of luck

goredbat2	I'm not getting anywhere in life and I don't think I'm ever going to. I'm depressed and need help but I'm too scared to ask for it. | My life is all just one big joke I sit and do non productive things almost everyday all day I'm 15 going through really bad depression I've cut about 10 times think about suicide all the time  have only 9 hours a week of homeschooling don't study and don't do homework (extra work) I cry all the time and eat a lot of food whenever I do to stop crying I have 1 friend which I barely hangout with and my mom saw my scars before I told her about my depression but she thinks I'm better now but I'm not I just say I'm happy leave me alone whenever she brings it up my education is bad and I have no desire to get a job when I grow up I just hurt and feel very sad and lonely most of the time I need help.
goredbat2	I cried seeing this this is apart of how I feel and it breaks my heart knowing that so many people go through what I have to deal with everyday
goredbat2	Ya I don't exactly eat healthy myself plus I eat twice as much calories a day then I should be consuming.
goredbat2	Idk I don't really like leaving the house but I'll try to see what energy boosters I have and exercise at home
goredbat2	Not really the most healthy thing but I'll try and see what I have for a energy booster.
goredbat2	I have a gym membership but I rarely use it
goredbat2	Yeah I don't imagine it lasts very long I have the luxury of exercise equipment right at my house but I never feel up to using it.
goredbat2	Oh well I already eat 5-6 meals a day anyways to cope with my sadness. Maybe I'll try a protein bar might work for my not so bad days :P
goredbat2	I can't seem to get myself to exercise | I'm depressed and trying to get better by reading and exercising but I'm always either not feeling up to exercising or too tired how can I overcome this?
goredbat2	Lol now I wanna see a toad smoke a cigarette.
goredbat2	Omg I never knew toads smoked cigarettes.
goredbat2	Me too usually I end up drinking like only 2 glasses of water a day I'll look for a app like that in the App Store I think that will help me a lot.
goredbat2	Well thanks for the advice I'm gonna try working out at some point to see if that helps and maby one day I'll try therapy but that might not be for a while.
goredbat2	Idk If I wanna see a therapist or not that's the thing like I guess I wouldn't know if I would like therapy or not unless I tried it. I guess I'm just scared of the thought that I would be telling someone everything that I'm feeling right now and if I did tell my parents that I'm still going through depression they would make me see a therapist cause they already tried having me do activities to make me feel better but it didn't work.
goredbat2	Ok that's actually a good thing you tell me this because I drink very little water I'll go drink some right now thanks.
goredbat2	Me too thanks a lot for all of your help I think I'll try and find something that helps like I'm gonna try and workout tonight I hope I'll be able to get at least 30 minutes to an hour of exercise done
goredbat2	I don't like talking to my parents about it they saw my scars before but they think I'm doing better now which I'm not at all I just lie to them and say I am feeling better plus they offered to pay to get therapy for me but I declined the offer because I'm too scared to talk to anyone about what I'm feeling.
goredbat2	I hope so maybe I'll try to find some activity or something that provides a distraction and makes me feel better thanks for the comment reading this gives me a bit of hope that things will one day get easier but no I don't really have any desire to get anywhere in life at the moment but I'm trying my best to find something that helps with my depression and meds have side affects and stuff so I don't really wanna start taking meds plus I heard it can take a really long time to find a antidepressant that helps you.
goredbat2	Maby I'll think about working out I have a couple of expensive exercise equipment at my house and ya some days aren't terrible but most of the days I'm very sad and don't do anything productive
goredbat2	I'm depressed uneducated and 15 | My life is very sad for I think 4 years I've been homeschooled half of that time only 9 hours a week of schooling never do extra work (homework) and I don't plan on straightening my life out although I know for sure I'm not gonna get anywhere in life if i don't start getting a proper education so that makes me very sad but that's just one part I also have like no friends and barely hangout with my family I just sit playing games atleast 10 hours a day while sad and crying btw my parents are unaware I'm still going through depression they knew I was depressed before when they saw the scars on my arm (don't worry I stopped cutting myself because I'm scared they will see more scars but I would still like to cut :P) I was kindof forced to tell them about it at that point but I stopped talking about it to them said I was doing fine and was happy (wish I still am saying that) so they think I'm better now but inside I'm really still hurting and cry all the time I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with life when I grow up at this point even if my depression stops or gets better I'm still very uneducated I struggle so much with the basics like very basic math (I'm in 9th grade technically) and I doubt I'll get a job at all if i do it certainly won't be a well paying one depression just makes everything so hard but luckily even though I don't want to but have no other choice my parents said I can live with them even when I grow up not really looking forward to that but at the rate I'm at this is what my sad life is gonna end up like I'm not really sure what else to put here  but if anyone maby has suggestions on what I can do to help with my depression (I've done hours of research on what I can do but it's either too hard or I've already tried it) I'd definitely appreciate it I'll try my.best to reply to any comments as fast as I can thanks for reading I know it was long and sorry for the bad punctuation I'm on my iPad though so stuff gets auto corrected thankfully.
goredbat2	It really doesn't ever go away? What about the things articles say online they say it goes away eventually well that sucks if it never goes away I do go to the y and workout every now and then but not frequently exercising isn't really my thing
goredbat2	I don't think I would be cut out for construction work I'm a bit overweight and I never workout so not strong at all plus with my current mental state getting a job right now probably isn't a good idea idk if I'm gonna get one ever really but if I'm gonna i would wait until I'm atleast 18 just hopeing the depression goes away eventually many in 2 or 3 years if I'm lucky 
GOAT_martin	I've been depressed for so long I can't even cry about it anymore. | It upsets me how normalized I've made my depression. I can't even elicit a genuine emotional response from it. Am I just "over" my depression, or is it such a normal part of life now?
GOAT_martin	I hate going to sleep because it makes tomorrow cone faster, but I also love sleep because it lets me avoid myself for a little while. | 
GOAT_martin	"Stupid science bitch, bitch"
GOAT_martin	I think I figured out the cycle of my depression. | Here it is in short: 1) I'm terrified of dying and quickly being forgotten. My own mortality is my worst fear.  2) I want other people to like me so I can always have friends so I can be remembered after I die.  3) I try acting on instinct, or "being myself" to get people to like me. It doesn't work, so I put on a false persona. A persona that is a lot better than me.  4) False persona works, and keeps people from knowing my true self.  5) Lack of intimacy for so long leads to a fear of intimacy.  6) Fear/lack of intimacy makes me feel incredibly alone.  7) Loneliness leads to depression.  8) Once a depressive episode starts I tend to go through everything that depresses me, including realizing that after I die my name might not live on.   Wash. Rinse. Repeat. 
GOAT_martin	What? I genuinely don't understand any of this. Can some please explain?

GOAT_martin	Obama did too much. 
GOAT_martin	You're forgetting that in a free market the consumer has power. If the market shows demand for libraries somebody will notice this demand, and start a profitable library. If the market doesn't show demand for a library then the vast majority of people won't notice or care if there are no libraries. Ask yourself: How different would my life be if there were no public libraries? I feel confident in saying that you would likely go one with your life, and Google something when you want an answer.  One thing the public needs to recognize for the free market to truly succeed is that people want to make money. It is the role of the consumer to exploit the desire. Say the government turned all roads over to private corporations, and these corporations started setting up toll booths. You, the consumer, could just walk off the roads. You don't pay the corporations, they stop making money, and they change so that they can be making money. 
GOAT_martin	Yes. Their freedom to retain the profits that they earned. Capitalists (Libertarians especially) believe that no one has a right to your money. They believe that taxation is simply theft. Now, I don't really know how Libertarians would pay for things such as schools, roads, or libraries; but they've probably thought long and hard about that, and likey have a solution that I'm not seeing. 
GOAT_martin	I think you're missing a crucial point here. Companies like Uber, Lyft, and Air BnB all include consensual sharing of property in exchange for monetary value. What worries capitalists is the non-consensual sharing of goods and services because the government tells you to. This is what capitalists are mainly afraid of; someone taking away their basic freedoms. The freedom to choose who to share their possesions with included.

GOAT_martin	How ironic. 
GOAT_martin	I know I'm a little late, but when I went to see Gaurdians of The Galaxy: Vol. 2, a fairly large family came in just before the movie started. They sat near the front, and I guess they recognized someone sitting near the top because they started whisper shouting to other people. When the other people didn't respond, they progressed to just shouting at them. The movie had started by now, and these people were literally shouting to other people in the theater. Anyway, about 2/3 through the movie the dad got up (there was an area separating the upper seating from the lower seating meant as a walkway to the exits, and he hoped in-between chairs. More anger) I figured he just had to go use the restroom. Whatever. But then I start to faintly smell tobacco. I look over to see this guy standing directly in front of the exit vaping. VAPING. It still makes me mad. 
GOAT_martin	Sleep? Nah, I didn't really need that next week. 
GOAT_martin	What is the Libertarian argument for the stance on Net Neutrality? | I know I'm a little late to the Net Neutrality party today, but this question just popped into my head while thinking about Net Neutrality. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like the Libertarian would argue against Net Neutrality.  My gutteral feeling is that a libertarian would say, "Let the market sort it out, and don't involve it with the government," Is this true, and if so, what is the expanded version of this argument? I feel I should make it clear that I'm not a liberatian, but I do respect how Liberatianism focuses on the economy when making non-economic decisions (if that makes sense).  Edit: After thinking about this more, I thought: Wouldn't giving the power to censor content to the large corporations contradict Libertarian values? This is just another general question. 
GOAT_martin	The exclamation point is immediately followed by a period.

GOAT_martin	As a natural introvert, it feels really good when someone else texts me first. | 
GOAT_martin	That's understandable. I still want to have conversations with people and I feel like someone else starting the conversation takes the pressure off me to. Also, it's a nice dopamine spike when other people seek out a conversation with you. 
GOAT_martin	With all respect, I feel like you're in the minority. Texting allows the time to think of a good response which is why I, at least, prefer texting. 
GOAT_martin	That's also likely!
NoMyNameIsGREG409	fuck this shit | i literally don't give a fuck about anything anymore. i dont even understand why i'm still here tbh. literally the only thing stopping me from offing myself was my parents and yesterday they said that they don't give a fuck about me. im so fucking tired of this shit. fuck feeling lonely and sad and alone i just want this shit to fucking end. i dont even know why im posting this tbh. im just fucking done with everything   i just want this shit to end

Pikabluee	When you read back on your past journal entries... | Anyone that journals their thoughts ever read back to what they wrote days, weeks, months ago and think "Damn, I was really messed up that day." or just wonder what you were even thinking.   Sometimes I get sad and emotional rereading what I wrote because I can feel the pain that I was in in that moment. My handwriting was poor, I rambled on and on for pages upon pages, repeated myself, talked about the littlest things. I would be so introspective and just analyzed every little thing and note weird shit. Then there are times when I surprise myself with things I talk about and it just makes me reflect a little. One thing that I wrote that I just read and is sticking to me was several months ago: "I feel like I'm better off being alone though there are times that I can't handle being alone.". It was around the time that I had my first and so far only panic attack ever and it's just brings back the memory of me alone in my dorm on a Wednesday night, trying not to get tears in the paper...  Another one that's just now fucked me up is a few weeks ago: "Sometimes I feel like such a loser- like I have nothing going for me. It's as though I've made up an illusion for my life that shows how everything is good. Am I really happy?".   I hate that I barely have anything positive in the journal because I always write in it when I'm sad or just feeling dull or bored. I'm trying to write more in it because there's so much on my mind that needs to be poured out. I want to see how my mind progressing and be able to look back on this in a few years- hopefully during a better mental states and see how far I've gotten out of this hole.  Anyone relate though? I don't know. I'm just procrastinating on homework and studying to start a conversation.
Pikabluee	Making self-depreciating jokes about myself around others | I often make fun of myself in a harsh my playful way around people I know especially when there is a very light mood in the conversation. I've been told by my parents that it's a bad habit and can affect my ego even if I don't think it does.  It was only just brought to my full-on attention today when my roommate brought our whole suite two boxes of pizza. I hesitantly took a slice even though I've been trying to eat more healthy and workout and resumed saying "My fatass can't resist this. Why do you do this to me, [insert roommate name here]."  We both laughed at it and went on with what we were doing. Then we sat in the living room and we're talking for a few moments when I have another one of my episodes when I say something every weird or act awkward and just... ugh. I don't even know what I'm thinking sometimes. Anyway, when I did that, I was like "Oh my God. I'm such a fucking dumb ass little bitch. Fuck. I don't know what's wrong with me at times. I feel like I need to formally apologize to you guys because of my weirdness."  And my roommate responds "You know. You really talk down on yourself a lot and you do it ruthlessly."  And I just kind of paused and sank into my chair when I realized how right she was.   She goes on to say "Like people joke a lot about themselves but I feel like there are jokes that have a deeper meaning beyond the joke. Like it's something else going on inside them. I'm not saying that's you but... yea." And then she just politely smiles because she doesn't actually know what's going on inside of me and that she's fucking right deserves a PhD in psychology.  You know when someone tells you something about yourself that you kind of knew before but didn't full give a crap about or put into your full vision and you just sit back and reflect. Then you become silent and half-sad, half-terrified because you don't know what to do. And then the person asks if you're ok because you're suddenly silent and you awkwardly lie and say you are when in reality you mind is crumbling.   I always wonder if the days that I'm actually happy are the days when I'm fooling myself and the days when I'm depressed are when I realize that I'm fooling myself...

Pikabluee	Wtf you took the words right out of my mouth.   I have 3 other roommates and I'm sure they realize by now that I literally do nothing and am boring as hell. I'm always locked in my room while they're talking and discussing life in the living area or going out somewhere. They don't even invite me to anything and if I don't ask what's going on, I'll never know. For instance, there's apparently going to be a party in our dorm since one then has a birthday in two weeks. No one confirmed if I was invited (even though I technically am since I live here).  It's such a strange and sad feeling when you know don't do much and you know your roommates know that too.
Pikabluee	I did but it wouldn't let me post for some reason. I tried over and over. 
Pikabluee	I have work in an hour and wish I didn't have to go. I'm in no mood to do anything and I've just been staring off into space, laying down, and crying all morning. I hate how unproductive I am.   I know it's all my fault and that's what makes it hurt worse.   I have so much coursework and studying to do and I can't do it. I woke up early and everything, ready to get some things done and I just crashed.   I don't even want to look at myself in the mirror because seeing my depressed state just makes me feel worse.   I really wish I could just not show up to work. I'm quitting anyway so what difference does it make? It's not like the 7.50 an hour will help.  
Pikabluee	Does anyone ever feel oblivious or disconnected from what's going on around them? | All my friends know about the latest news, music release, drama, person of interest, and I'm sitting here trying to figure out what they're talking about. I feel so disconnected from people and closeted. It makes it hard for me to relate to people.  It's not even the fact that I'm not really in tuned to social media but little social things, I feel off on. I'm so awkward sometimes... I mean, I can be fun to be around but it feels like everyone I hang around knows a little bit more than me when it comes to societal and social things. I'm always behind so I either have to pretend that I know what they're talking about or just ask for elaboration of everything and feel stupid doing so.  It makes me feel like I don't get out much...
Pikabluee	Put a 60s filter on this pic and it would be amazing. True classic man right there.
Pikabluee	I guess they'll float too. 
Pikabluee	I would not like that in downtown Atlanta. No thank you. 
Pikabluee	I'm literally having a mini mental breakdown and I don't know what to do | My job (which I'm quitting Wednesday) requires that I work from 3am to 7am and 11pm to 1am on Mondays. I have an 11am class on Mondays leaving me with only like 2 hours to sleep. To get a good 7 hours of sleep before the 3am shift I would have to go to bed at 5pm on Sunday.  Also I have a Tuesday class that starts at 8am leaving me with only 4 hours of sleep before that if you take into factors like getting ready for bed and walking back to my dorm and me getting up an hour an a half before class. On top of that, in that 8am class, I have my first big exam of the semester so I'm probably not going to perform well if I'm tired.   I literally don't know what to do. Because I barely have much time left to study, I'm procrastinating as we speak, and I feel like I'm going to fail my bio exam. I'm a bio major. I can't afford to fail bio tests.   I've been crying since yesterday because I feel like I've hit a brick wall. I know this is temporary but a bad grade and lack of sleep isn't.   What if I just don't show up? I'm quitting anyway.   Plus there's a storm coming during my shift at 11pm...   I can't do this and I'm tired of crying.  I feel like I'm in no control of my life right now. 
Pikabluee	Do you have a particular decade that you connect with well/obsess over? If so why? | 
Pikabluee	But it's even worse when you can't even connect with them in my opinion. I call them my friends but there are times when I don't even know if they really are... we live together but don't hang out much if at all. They hang out with each other more than they hang out with me except for one of them.
Pikabluee	If you really really want and must go you MUST familiarize yourself with the culture, laws, and etiquette of the country THOROUGHLY beforehand.   Too many times do tourist think they're being heroes by breaking rules and exposing the government and get in big trouble for it. If you're told not to do something, DON'T DO IT. Don't think you'll be slick enough not I get caught taking a picture here and there of something top secret or stealing a poster or other object.   However, I can't control you actions. If you're going to do these things, do so at your own risk. Imprisonment and the judicial system there is no laughing matter and charges are three times worse than you're use to for simple acts of crimes. A mere citation to you could mean a felony for them. I'm sure you've heard the stories...  I also recommend learning some Korean- at least the basic phrases and how to respond to them. Learn how to address superiors in a polite manner. You'll probably have a translator or guide with you since they don't trust foreigns on their own but I still recommend it so your not completely clueless to in situations of Korean only conversation.   Don't be a rebel and try to get yourself on the news for the wrong reason. If they tell you to do something like bow to a portrait of the leaders of Kim Jong Il's statue, do it. Respect their culture and respect their traditions.   Many of the people there truly love and respect their country just like other nationalities. If you come into direct contact with locals, obviously be polite but don't say things like "They're brainwashing you!" or "You government is terrible!".   Just be a regular tourist above all. Enjoy the culture, history, and whatnot. I do, however, want you to be even more cautious of the fact that there are tensions in the nation as we speak with threat of missile strikes and disputes between other nations.   
Pikabluee	If that makes you feel better, go for it (well technically you already did so...). I smoke sometimes just to relax or take my mind off things too. 
Pikabluee	My dad had the same car. It went to Canada, New York, and Georgia until it was finally laid to rest in 2005. Ahh, memories as a kid riding in that thing with my dad.
Pikabluee	I get so upset for no apparent reason after have a phone call with my mom. | I don't know why but every time I talk to my mom on the phone, I'm overcome with despondence and sadness and lose motivation. I just got off the phone with her and we were talking about simple stuff like what I need my dad to bring me from the store. And I cried and just felt like crap afterward.   I don't know what's triggering it but I can never sound uplifting while talking to my mom and also my dad on the phone. Maybe I'm not a phone conversation person but talking to them- especially long convos just trigger my depression so hard and debilitate me for a good while. Aches that I have get worse and my whole body just hurts.  Maybe I'm passively remembering the arguments we've had about my mental health in the past or just not being on the same page as my parents but I don't know...  I was in the middle of doing coursework and was fine until that call came in. Now I just want to lay in bed for the rest of the day.  Does anyone feel like this? 
Pikabluee	Yea it really sucks because that was one of the things that kept me going, happy, and motivated and when I have to postpone it, it hurts. I love feel confident in myself and feeling accomplished and now I had to mess up.
Pikabluee	Everything feels like it's going down hill... again.   I injured my lower back being a dumbass and doing deadlifts with incorrect form and I barely can walk. All the advice of gotten is ridiculous and people barely seem to care.  I'm absolutely miserable because I can't do anything. I don't even have to motivation anymore because this pain. Someone told me that I should expect it to last a month but I can't even take day two of this. A month of stabbing, hammer hitting pain. Perfect.   Every day feels like I'm just going through the motions. I don't want to be considered lazy but I really just can't do things like I could before.  I hate having to put a smile on my face and act like everything is fine when all I do is stay in my dorm all day long when I'm not going to the dining hall or class am being sad about my progress.  The thing is, it was going well until I just start thinking about things... I feel like a robot sometimes. Just doing everything obediently with no emotions. And even if I do get emotions, they don't feel genuine but artificial.   I'm tired of complaining directly to people because they really really don't care. Thy listen to you and provide you with advice just to have a convo and then go about they're day with no care. I find that even with myself. That's why it feels so lonely.   Now everything hurts, both physically and mentally.   I just wish I could turn back time and warm my stupid self about doing those deadlifts. Oh my god, and it was so embarrassing because I could tell people around me knew I was fucking up by the looks...
Pikabluee	"Bill, how many times I gotta tell ya to walk the damn dog!"  "Oh I thought you said car... Shoot."
Pikabluee	Extreme pain after deadlifting | [removed]
Pikabluee	Noted
Pikabluee	I like that
Pikabluee	Oh man... well then I'm going to have to bring it home pronto. But I fear it'll die by then. Can the plant spring up from its ashes? Or rather could I create an artificial dormancy period with the plant for the time being until I can make arrangements for it to be in a more suitable environment?
Pikabluee	What's your criteria and where do you draw the line on getting revenge on someone? | 
Pikabluee	Why is my Venus fly trap dying? | 
Pikabluee	In-Depth Info:  I've had this plant for about three months. It was kept outside for the most part and caught insects well and was healthy. Got several hours of direct sunlight and rainfall frequently as well as manual waterings when there wasn't much rain.  After I left for college, I brought the plant with me and it's been indoors ever since. There is no direct sunlight through my window but there is light throughout the day as I keep my blinds open. For about a month it was doing well and I kept watering it when needed with distilled water.  After that month I notified some of the leaves were dying but since there was new growth I didn't think anything of it. Then the plant flowered and with my knowledge of young VFT can be weakened my flowers, I snipped off the stem. It only flower once.   The plant continued to grow but the trap part of the leaves had stunted growth an would even wilt before reaching maturity. The rest of the stem and leaves would remain green and healthy-looking for several weeks until wilting.   Right now there are two leaves that are following that path with wilting traps and green stems and two others that are younger that look fairly normal.   I have just started implementing an artificial light source with is just a fluorescent desk lamp bulb over it that I leave on for about 4 to 5 hours.  I do not know if the plant is going into dormancy or if it can even sense the season change to Fall while indoors. I'm hoping it's trying to go dormant but I'm not sure.  My room is kept at about 72 to 78 degrees.
Pikabluee	I'm not going to skip brushing my teeth before bed. That's disgusting.  Secondly, I don't "dick around". There are actually some things I need to take care of before going to bed and I don't exactly  fall asleep in a snap.  
Pikabluee	My supervisor wants me working 3am to 7am shifts when I have early morning classes | I have an on-campus job at my university that involves tending to the front desk in the lobby of one of the dormitories.   I have an 11am class every Monday and Wednesday. I am supposed to work from 3am to 7am every Monday for the rest of the semester which would leave me only an hour of sleep before class. (It would take me an hour to walk back to my dorm, brush my teeth, get myself together, and settle into bed and I usually wake up an hour and a half before my class starts)   I have pressed with him how this will ruin my sleep cycle and I won't be prepared for class because I'll be a zombie from lack of sleep. He told me to make my hours more flexible and I did so but during the official schedule-setting time, he still didn't change my hours at all but in fact added hours to one of my days so I work 6 hours after my class from 1 pm to 7 pm instead of 4.  I told him I would be more available on the weekends and Wednesday afternoons and I understand a lot of other employees are being scheduled but this is ridiculous.   I know this is going to inhibit my school performance but not only take away the time I have to study but also sleep.  They always say to prioritize my coursework before my schoolwork and that's what I'm doing. He's making me seem selfish for doing such things- saying "This is a team-run job. You have to make sacrifices." when there are people in the same predicament as me.  I have tried trading hours with people but they won't pick up my hours because they're no desirable.  And it's not like I'm learning from this job. I'm sitting at a desk all day checking people's IDs as they walk in. The only benefit I get is a $7.50/hour pay.  What do I do?
Pikabluee	Oh I did and I ran so much omg. I added almost 40 pounds more to my weights and it felt like nothing. I was killing the fuck out of the weights omg. I'm wondering if when I go back when I'm sober if I'll keep the same strength.   But I had a great session overall. 
Pikabluee	I'm on the treadmill as we speak and high af lol. Let's see how this goes. Feelin great rn.
Pikabluee	So I'm thinking about eating an edible before working out | I've wanted to try working out while high for a while and I feel like doing it tomorrow morning. I wake up around 6 am and wait around for the sun to come up a little before heading out so during that time I could eat a likkle piece of an edible and then head out as soon as I feel it hit lol. (I'm literally laughing to myself thinking about this.)  I'm not going to eat too much of the edible as I'll be on an empty stomach and because I've gone a while without smoking or having any ingestion of weed.   I just heard that weed helps you to perform better during workouts and I was wanting to try it.   I think it's going to be hilarious just running on the treadmill high af at 7 am idk. Lol.  But also, now that I'm thinking about it... My heart beats pretty fast when I'm high  so would that fuck up my heart if I'm running?   Has anyone been high and worked out before? And if so, how'd it go?
Pikabluee	Yea true. They actually implemented a new law in my state (Georgia) known as Campus Carry in which students can carry guns in designated areas in universities. I'll probably stick to pepper spray though because if my am is shit in CoD, it's gonna be shittier in real life lmao.
Pikabluee	When I miss going to the gym in the early morning so I have to go when it's packed to the brim in the afternoon. Just pisses me off when all the equipment is taken especially the shit that I use often.   Also what's annoying is when I do wake up early- around 6 am it's still dark out and I have to walk to the gym. In the city. Where there have been reports of mugging. As a girl... I literally debate every day "Should I wait it out or just risk it?" 
Pikabluee	Lol on that canteen thing. I have one of those 28 oz steel air-tight water bottles that I carry lol.  And it's about four blocks but there are a bunch of homeless men that have the tendency to catcall and follow you (yea...). And there will be guys that literally come to a full stop on the road along the curb to say something to you.   I actually went this morning and I'm back from the gym now and it wasn't too bad.   I have a little knapsack where I carry everything. I never hold my phone in the early mornings- only after the sun comes up so I can listen to music on my way back from the gym.
Pikabluee	lol I'm at university but there's a home gym back at my house. 
Pikabluee	I don't carry a bicycle to university and it would be a slight inconvenience for me with my situation. 
Pikabluee	Sometimes I wonder how people have so many friends. | Every day my roommates are always bringing in someone new, have tons of texts coming in, and hanging out with all kinds of people.  I'm a very sociable person and I would consider myself kind, outgoing, and nice to be around. I've heard it from people that I am.  Yet I barely have any friends. I literally don't do anything.  I just sit in my room most of the time and do coursework or play video games. Going to the gym helps me pass the time but besides that, I'm really boring.   It's so embarrassing when I think about how my roommates have never seen me go out somewhere or have a friend over. I'm always tagging along with them.  I always feel lame. Most of the time I don't think about it and go on my merry way because I have other things to bother me. But there are times like this that it really hits me...
Pikabluee	Shit, I wish I had a bf... :/
Pikabluee	Is this an eating disorder? | I've been very conscious about going to the gym during my scheduled times and have felt very upset with myself for missing it two times in the span of two weeks. So much so that I cry just thinking about it.  I feel like I've wasted time not going. There's a fixed time frame for when I can go to the gym since I'm in college and have classes.  I also noticed that I've had a decreased appetite lately. I don't know if it's because I have a cold or what. But every time I eat sweets or desserts, I feel unhealthy and irresponsible about my health.   My friend brought s'mores yesterday and I ate like three and kept saying "There's so many calories in this. I can't keep eating these." and she's like "It's alright. Treat yourself once in a while." but it just made me scared.  My roommate put a scale in the bathroom and I've been checking it about three times a day, freaking out when my weight goes up DURING THE DAY. And then I can only hope it's from eating and the theory that you gain weight through the day...  I'm really scared for myself but I can't fight the feelings.   I don't believe I'm overweight or anything- I'm 5'7" and 133 lbs. (the scale says different things at times :( ) but I feel like I have a long way to go to get the figure I want.   Should I be concerned and does anyone have any tips to counteract these thoughts I'm having?
Pikabluee	Thanks for that. I really needed it.
Pikabluee	Thank you. I'll look into it.
Pikabluee	I get really upset and depressed after missing a workout. | [removed]
Pikabluee	Do I ask them if I was invited? | So last week my suitemates had their friends over- two of whom I'm acquainted with and a new girl that I click with because of her cool personality. We shared laughs and had a great time hanging out- the 8 of us.   At one point, one of the girls mentioned a sleepover that she was planning at her dorm. I didn't exactly feel excluded since they didn't turn away from me and chat secretly but I didn't feel fully included- of that makes sense. I just met these few girls but I've know my suitemates for a while so it makes me the middle person a little.  Anyway, at one point, one of my suitemates discussed what they would be doing at the sleepover and made the inclination that I would be involved when she turned to me and and the others and quoted "you all".   It's not the type of thing where someone hands you a physical invite or anything because it's a casual girl's night.  I assumed they would be cool with me attending since we all got along well. And I also assumed that they assumed that I was invite but I'm not 100% sure.  The sleepover is this Thursday but I don't want to day to come and I'm all excited and I get into an awkward moment when they say something like "Oh I didn't know you were coming too." or "We were thinking it was just going to be us this time."  I'm not the big party animal but I like to enjoy myself with good people once in while. I'm also not that outward and overly social so it's hard for me to get my intentions across to people without feeling pushy.  How do I see if I'm invited. Like do I just ask "Hey guys, so I can tag along with this sleepover, right?". It feels so weird.  In the past it's always been invites or open college parties that I've attended.   I don't want to have my hopes up and end up sitting in my dorm alone Thursday night feeling like a loser.
Pikabluee	Wish my friends bars were that large... Actually I think mine are nonexistent now that I think about it.  There were be a whole lot of purple though, that's for sure...
Pikabluee	Advice on how to complain about roommate's indecency. | Ok so I'm in college and live in a dorm with three other girls. We all have own own rooms.   I'm friends with all of them as we had the same Chem lecture last semester and we all hung out with each other.  One of the girls is the type that is very outward about her looks and very confident which I have no problem with. However, she will walk around topless and have conversations with you while topless and it's awkward. She also sleeps on the couch instead of her room a lot and snores loudly- loud enough for me to hear from my room down the hallway.  She's up late and invite people over often and I hear her laughing and talking up until 5 am in the morning.  This morning was really awkward though. I went into the kitchen to get something and look to my right into the living room and was stunned when I saw her laying in the couch fully naked with nothing covering her, boobs and everything out while she's there snoring away.   Imagine if someone brought over a guest or had their parents coming to visit.   Now so know there will be those people that say "We were all born naked." and "You're all girls so what's the problem." but there's are things called decency and modesty which have lines that can be crossed.   I've had to complain to her about cleaning up after herself and multiple things before but this by far will be the most awkward. Like what am I to say "I saw you naked this morning and don't think it's cool for you to be sleep ok the couch with your whole body exposed."?  
Pikabluee	That's awesome to hear. Good luck!
Pikabluee	"Welcome to your tape."
Pikabluee	I was about to give you my condolences then I saw what subreddit this is under...  I've been fooled again...
Pikabluee	Wait wtf you've seen this girl at the gym for the past year. Huh?? Ask her out!!!   And she's glancing at you?? What...   Um. Helloooo!   Ask. Her. Out.  Make. A. Move.  What have you got to lose? Worse case scenario is that she says "No" or "I have a boyfriend.". It's better to take the risk than go to that gym every day wondering.  Next time you see this girl, I don't care if it's in the damn parking lot of that gym. You're asking her out. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  I can't tell you how many times I've had the same situation as you. Guys looking at my while I'm doing my squats and crunches lol while they're busting out those deadlifts. It's hard at the gym because that's where those attractive human beings come out but you have to just nip it in the bud and do it. JUST DO IT!   You are getting this girl. You have the power. The ball is in your court.  
Pikabluee	I never realized...
Pikabluee	So in other words, it doesn't help my 19 year old female self lol.
Pikabluee	Is it true that multivitamins are most unnecessary unless you're low in many vitamins and nutrients? | My mom has been making me take multivitamins since I was a kid and it was only a few years ago that I started to doubt their necessity. I eat balanced meals. I'm healthy and even more so now that I'm exercising and eating even better.  I'm strictly told to take two chewable Women's multivitamins by vitaFusion but do I really need them? My doctor says I'm not deficient in anything.  I heard that you shouldn't take vitamins unless you're deficient in the things that the vitamin provides or it's really not helping you.  Thoughts?
Pikabluee	Ok scratch that. Beneficial or harmful. 
Pikabluee	Lol oh no... 😂😂

Pikabluee	ASMR by far the greatest help for sleep. I fall asleep within minutes.  However, I like to have background noise as well since I was a kid. I like hearing commotion outside my room like people talking or a TV going. It's calming for some reason.   Rain also helps- preferably rainy, thunderous rain. I like having a little light in my room so I open my blinds just a little to have some moonlight or, since I'm now at uni in the city, building and car lights.  Having a poker game playing in the background always has me falling asleep lol. Something about the chips clicking and the quiet, short convos between the players and the announcers dull voice put be to sleep. I always love accidentally finding the poker channel right before bed. Haha.
Pikabluee	I'm just rude as hell. Lol!

Pikabluee	Should I trim off dying Venus Fly Trap lead? | 
Pikabluee	An ex-friend of mine had tormented me, belittled me, and gaslighted me for two semesters last year in college. I still can't believe to this day that I let her get away with it for so long. It caused me to be depressed and I cried almost every day because of her narcissistic psychopathy. She would always prioritize herself and not give two shits about my personal availability or mood.   Anyway, we got into a big argument one day- one of many- and didn't speak to each other for over a week. She was my only friend so it sucked not having anyone around. Anyway, I broke the silence by sending her an email apologizing for any offense I brought to her (I really had nothing to apologize for but I did so because I was too empathetic and nice and desperate.) and also how she hurt me with the way she acted towards me. It was a lengthy email and took me about 20 minutes to write.  I told her to read the email in a text and literally a minute later she said she finished it. But how could that be when the email was literally an essay. I know she didn't read it fully.  Anyways, this was her "apology" message. "Omg, I read it. [crying emoji]" Next message: "Let's go to the dining hall and eat. I think they have wings today."  She literally acted as though nothing happened. I was sitting there crying my eyes out while she didn't even give a damn.  She literally changed my whole mindset on people and I now do not give my trust to people as easily. She hurt me that much. I forgive her but I told myself that I would never fall for that bullshit again.
Pikabluee	That'a me too lol. Playing League past 3 even when I have work in the morning. Then I mentally kick myself for being so dumb. I'm a night owl though so I can't help it.
Pikabluee	That happens to me too but I would never have the energy to get up and take a cold shower. You're good.
Pikabluee	I... I like you.
Pikabluee	I disagree. They didn't say that they hated black women. They said that they aren't attracted to them. That doesn't make them a racist.  Also nothing is wrong with not being attracted to a particular group of people. There's a psychological reason why that could be. I'm a black female and I'm not really attracted to black males. It's seen as wrong because of the expectation that I should like the opposite gender within my race.   This person is only asking this question because society pressures people to have an attraction to everyone and include all races when it comes to them relationship radar. Everyone should be free to be attracted to whomever they choose.
Pikabluee	Deranged homeless man holding a large rock and walking up and down the sidewalk, threatening to throw it at each passerby while shouting random things about getting his "shit" together and the government. The funniest part was when this girl pretended as though she was on her phone with her mom and tried to play it cool while scurrying away from the man.
Pikabluee	Not being attracted to a race doesn't equal being racist towards them. It simply means that you don't see yourself in a relationship with them. Don't jump to conclusions like that.
Pikabluee	My neighbor was driving my parents and I to the airport a few months ago when someone coming out of a neighborhood entrance to our right whizzed passed the stop sign at full speed to turn left onto the same road we were on.   The driver came super close to us while they were turning and my neighbor had to swerve over to the other side of the road. An incoming car drove towards us on that side and she quickly had to swerve back into the right lane.  She literally dodged two cars in less than 5 seconds. Had she not had quick thinking and reflexes my dad and I would have been dead (since we were sitting on the right side of the car) and my mom and neighbor would have been severely injured. My heart skipped two beats in those moments. I had to clap to my neighbor.  
Pikabluee	Ok... I see your point. It's better to be safe than sorry. Thanks for looking out for me. I see to making up an appointment.
Pikabluee	I've been doing a lot of walking anyway since I walk to work everyday and run errands around the city so I'll see how that goes.
Pikabluee	Why am I getting chest pain days after running? | I went for a morning run two days ago and right after the run I felt some pressure in my chest and ears that slowly went away. The following day (yesterday) the right side of my sternum was hurting when I expanded my chest to breathe, coughed, or laughed. It still hurts today.  This has never happened to me when I've ran in the past. However, this is my first time in a while doing serious running.  I ran in short intervals throughout a mile. Walking then running. I'm in the city so I stopped frequently for traffic at the end of blocks.   But the pain was so bad today that I didn't go for another run because I was worried I would be overexerting myself.   I ate only an energy bar and drank a cup of water beforehand. I made sure to stay hydrated the days before and the morning of. I also stretched and warmed up to get my heart rate going.   I'm not out of shape and am fairly lean but I haven't done serious exercise in a while.
Pikabluee	I'm a bit nervous by you saying that I should go to the doctor. I'm going to give it a few days and see what transpires.

Pikabluee	I put miracle grow sticks in it a month ago. I don't know if that will keep it at bay.  There aren't any vents blowing directly on it.
Pikabluee	I'm afraid that it might be root rot according to your link which, by the way, was very helpful and informative.  I'm planning on transporting the plant into a new pot with new soil but do you have any more advice on what to do to help it further. I would really be disappointed if it dies.  Also, should I trim off the already discoloured leaves or leave them on? Do they provide the plant any benefit if they have some green in them?
Pikabluee	Ivy watered recently with slightly damp soil dropping and having discoloration. Why? | 
Pikabluee	I've had this for almost a year and it's grown quite fast but lately has started to grow very slowly. The stems at the bottom have been present since I've bought them so I don't know...   The residence hall room that I was in before faced the west and provided plenty of sunlight but it was several months in that my Ivy started to drop. Watering it perked it up again but it needs to be watered almost every day.  In the shade it was great and only was watered twice or thrice a week. However, I am now remembering that I stupidly put hot water into a water bottle thinking that hot water equaled distilled water and poured that into the Ivy. I'm thinking that the minerals in the plastic is what is causing the problem because the discolouration didn't start until after the water bottle incident.  I'm going to stop watering it for now. Though I have pour a tiny bit of hydrogen peroxide into the soil as I heard that helps allow more oxygen to the plant.  I'm thinking of just repotting it over the weekend since it's grown significantly. It's about 2 feet tall with the vines extended.  Will a lamp help as I have one at the desk that the plant is at? The bulb is a compact fluorescent coil. It's brand new so I don't mind burning it to help the plant. 
Pikabluee	I'm getting this empty feeling again. Sitting in my dorm alone after my suitemate tells me that she's off to hang out with her friends.   Sometimes I feel like such a loser- like I have nothing going for me. I manage to put a smile on my face and act an upbeat way around people but at the end of the day when I'm back and alone in my room with just my thoughts, I see the truth and the facade that I've created for myself.   I don't feel like I have any real friends- just people that are around me constantly and have a quick conversation with. Everything just feels so dull and repetitive.   I'm feeling so numb and unable to do anything right now. Everything was going smoothly a couple days ago and now something had to trigger it.   I feel like sometimes I take things too seriously and make it worry me but even so I can't control how I think ever.   I feel like crying but I can't. I feel the knot in my throat. You know that mood that you get in when you can't do anything but just sit in silence and look off in space and have a completely empty conscience? I literally did that just now for ten minutes and somehow snapped out of it. I don't even know what the hell is wrong with me.   I need to keep myself occupied.  I feel like I'm now just rambling so I'll stop.   This thread helps me just release my thoughts. I have so many ups and downs that I'm tired of it. This time around the down is not as severe but still affecting me. 
Pikabluee	It's coming back again and I don't know what I'm going to do.   My mom is not helping with her endless angry whatsoever. She literally gets irritated at everything. She loves to have mini lessons based on behavior I had shown or things that I've said days before and it just puts me in a bad mood. She makes me feel like a child and a bad person at times. Don't get me wrong, she's not an abusive parent or anything but she constantly has ways of just bringing me down and making me more depressed. I sometimes question if I'm a good person because of her.  Sometimes I wish I just wasn't here- not kill myself but just be some entity that no one knows exists but I still live in the world. At times I hate my life so much and then other times I'm like "Oh man. Im so going to change the world for the better. I'm going to do surgery on people's brains and stuff and travel the world and be a philanthropist.".   I feel so broken a lot and feel like I've spent 75% of the time being sad or just in a dull mood. I get happy at times and can share laughs with people but at the end of the day I just look at myself like "What am I doing with myself. Am I actually happy in those moments."  And gosh, my parents are so hard on me. They're so quick to tell each other all the bad things I've done. I just here them constantly talking about me and arguing over my behavior. Constant bickering. I just sit on the steps listening to them downstairs just rambling on.  I can't even finish typing this...  Anyway, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm a brick room.  Sorry for any typos.
Pikabluee	Thank you for that. I'll keep trying.
Pikabluee	This literally put me in the best mood ever. I've been having a tough couple of days and needed something like this. 
Pikabluee	I have tried the couseling system twice at my university and didn't find it helpful. And it took them weeks and weeks to get back to me with scheduled appointment and someone that could be my regular therapist.   I liked talking to someone about my issues but I wanted solutions and something more out of it.
Pikabluee	I have gotten information on a few therapists in my area but haven't had the time to go to any or make an appointment. I'm going back to college in a few days and I know I won't have the time to see one.
Pikabluee	My mom worked with me to get some contact information of therapists in my area but we haven't had the time to actually go see anyone. And now I'm leaving for college on Monday so I will have no time to see one...
Pikabluee	When your mom says "At least look happy that you're alive." and you're not. | I still don't think she quite gets it and it's sad that she never will. It gives me less hope because it's my parents that I would think would be the first to be more understanding.  Every time I'm down or depressed, she says "Could you make your face look more pleasing." or "At least pretend to be happy." or "Can you just smile this once.".   No! I can't. I'm not here to please anyone.   She's always talking about how I don't take pride in my appearance because I rarely wear makeup anymore and don't wear earrings as much. She's like "Put yourself together some more and look appealing." Do I need makeup and jewelry to look appealing? Like I'm sorry I'm fine with how I look without extra stuff. Fucking hell, we were just going to Wal-Mart the other day and she acted like I'm going to a Cinderella ball.   She gets so pissed when I tell her that I'm being more progressive and embracing my natural self and even more so when I explain that I'm not always in the best of mood and that my moods are unpredictable.  She's so annoying and inconsiderate. I love her but there are times that her behavior gets to me so much that I despise her. Her go-to mood is anger and she throws a fit at every little thing I do and don't do.  There are times when I literally have no desire or energy to do things and she calls me lazy and orders me out of my room. She babies me a lot and will order me to eat when I'm not hungry, call my name every hour while I'm up in my room just for the hell of it, and make me do a bunch of random busy tasks when I just want to lie down and be alone.   She triggers my depression so much...  I'm going back to college next week and I don't know if I'm glad to be away from my mom or if I'm sad to be back where the stress originated from. I cried so much during my last year of college, had suicidal thoughts, and isolated myself from people and I'm afraid I'm going back to where the hell is.   There are times when I'm really not happy to be alive and times when I'm just going through the motions and am neutral about it. The world just makes me sad. I feel like my parents, especially my mom, are ignorant to it all and ignorant to what I'm going through and that I'll never be at peace with myself.   I have to be so so so careful when interacting with my mom and talking to her. One little change in my voice, being too confident in my opinions, answering questions too "intelligently" will set her off. I'm scared that it's damaging me mentally, making me timid but also making me have moments when I have bundled up my emotions for so long that I release them in a big explosion.   I have had countless discussions with my mom and told her about my concerns and she agreed to changed and has a bit but her behavior persists and still bothers me. I barely can open up to her anymore. She's always busy and when she's not, she sitting in front of the TV engrossed in the lies and bullshit that media throws at people called news. If I want to talk to her while the news is on, she'll shush me and get angry that I'm talking over the tv and I have to wait until commercials come on when I try to spit everything out before the news comes back on. News is apparently more important than me.  She also says "Try to concise your stories a little more." and shows frustration like my talking to her is a bother. But if she's telling me a long story, I have to listen intently even if it's just about a funny thing her friend told her on the phone that day. Ok I'm not a good storyteller but still listen to your child maybe?   Sometimes I end up just talking to myself about things when I'm alone because no one else will see eye to eye with me even if they do listen.  I get jealous of other people's moms. They all seem so cool and down to earth and nice... I know not everyone's mom is like that but my friends moms are so much more lenient and likable. Even my mom's colleague that visited us... she was so warm and funny. I bonded with her more those five days that she was here than I did with my mom for 19 years.   I don't know if it's me or the outside world anymore. I'm about done.
Pikabluee	Does anyone believe in depressive realism- that depression gives one a more accurate perception of reality? | I've thought about this for sometime and it was only today that I found out that it had a name. Apparently depressive realism is the theory that people with depression perceive reality more realistically than those without depression.  I've had depression for several years and it has intensified as my ideologies have changed. When I think about, most of my thoughts that trigger my depression stem from my opinions about society and sort of conspiracies about people and how the world works. It all feels like this whole world is a big fraud/hoax/lie and a trap that you can only really escape through death- as morbid as that sounds. I feel like other people- that don't have depression- don't see how pitiful the world is. They just feed into this survival game of a world and pretend that everything is ok.  I'm not saying I'm a big pessimist. I'm being a realist here.   I don't know how else to describe what I'm trying to say so I hope that I get my point across correctly.   I'm just saying what if depression is just being more aware of the world around you and life in general and the awareness of things is what leads to depression. Like some people can block that stuff out easily but the rest of us let all this stimuli in and are overburdened by it. What if we just think deeper than other people? They say ignorance is bliss so maybe our brains are more calculating and, dare I say, advanced?   Like have you ever gotten so frustrated when you try to explain to someone about your condition and they suggest all this crap like "talk to people" and "exercise" and what-not? Or even anything in general and it's like talking to a child or someone that speaks another language than you. What if they just aren't thinking as widely and as advanced?   I feel like I'm going to offend some people but I don't mean to. I just feel like this theory is onto something because studies have shown people with depression to be more intelligent than average. I'm not trying to blow my own horn here and glamorize depression because if I could, I would just take it away. I'm dead serious. It's caused me nothing but pain and misery.  I'm just wondering if maybe, just maybe, it had to do with perception, intelligence, and ways of thinking. I know I'm different than a lot of people and I'm yet to find someone that truly understands me and is on the same wavelength as me and I know there are other people out there that can relate.   I'm just looking for opinions.
Pikabluee	I was at the Dolphin Cove resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica last month and the coordinator was giving us training before we interacted with the dolphins. There was a French couple in front of me as I sat on the benches. The wife was smoking a cigarette and standing up blocking people's vision in the back while looking through her bag for something. Mind you, there are children that participate and it's a no-smoking area.  The instructor called her repeatedly and she pretended not to hear until finally she turned to him.  "No smoking here, ma'am." The instructor said. And she turned to him and was like "No speak English." even though a few minutes before she asked someone about where the bathroom was in perfect English.   She literally made the instructor have to make hand gestures to tell her to take out the cigarette and then she had to have an attitude about it- throwing it on the ground, stomping on it, covering it with sand with her foot, and turning back to the instructor as if to say "Is that good for you?".   She was lucky I'm rusty in French because I would have asked her who she thinks she was. Lol! 
Pikabluee	That's cool/interesting selection that you have there yourself. I just got into The Shins and actually mistook them for a 70s /80s group after hearing their song Dead Alive. Very unique sound they have though.
Pikabluee	Don't Stop Me Now - Queen (makes me feel invincible)  My House - Flo Rida (makes me dance like an idiot and I have a mini party in my car)  How Deep Is Your Love - Bee Gees (makes me reflect on life and think about my wedding since I want this to be the main song that plays during it)  Blossom - Milky Chance (makes me reflect on life as well but has a nice beat that lifts my spirits)  My music tastes sound like it's all over the place because it is lol! I like 70s music a lot though.
Pikabluee	Glad I could help. Good luck!
Pikabluee	Running and other rigorous activities can facilitate the production of hormones in the stomach lining due to all the movement. Mucosal permeability, which is how easily materials pass through the gastrointestinal tract, can also be altered.  There are also other factors which include genetics and how often a person needs to poo in general.  It's actually quite common that runners have the urge to use the toilet when running. A lot of runners complain about stomach pains and some even tell about accidents they've had while running...  To avoid this or lessen the possibility runners are told to not eat foods rich in fiber, fat, protein, or fructose within three hours before a run. Doctors also say not to take ibuprofen, aspirin, or other related medication before since they are known to cause GI problems as well and running will just amplify these issues. Don't eat right before a running and give time (at least 2 hours) for your food to digest. It's smart to do a warm up jog in which you run at a comfortable, leisurely pace around your neighborhood or a park and make a pit stop at home or the water fountain before doing the real thing.   Stay hydrated so that stools pass easily and come out when they should. You don't want to be holding them in due to constipation and then they decide to come along during a run. 
Pikabluee	There are people like that and you have to accept that about him. Children don't always follow suit with their parents when it comes to personality. He may just be more comfortable being by himself.  However, you should still look for clues if he is not in the best of mood and feeling lonely. But he can be alone but not be lonely, remember that. As long as he is happy, you shouldn't be too concerned.   I'm 19 but when I was in middle school, I was more social and an all-round person that was always trying to meet new people. Now that I'm older, I've had a change in my ideologies and keep to myself a little more. I have a handful of friends but most of the time I feel comfortable on my own, discovering things by myself.   He may be similar. Just keep an eye on him but don't bug him and say "Why aren't you hanging out with people more?" or "You're always home and not out.". Don't highlight that fact about him because it'll probably embarrass him or put him in a bad mood. You mentioned the friend that he had over some time- ask him about how that friend's doing, etc.   Maybe suggest an activity he could invite his friend to do with him. If he doesn't show interest, don't push it. Let him find himself.  Right now you should try to show that you are open to any conversation he wants to have with you and that you would be happy to talk with him about anything. So if he is facing a problem that relates to his introversion, he can readily talk to you. But don't jump to conclusions- just be neutral about it for now.  Best of luck to you and your son!
kbleth694	School is killing me | I literally don't know what to do anymore. I am only in high school and school makes me want to kill myself. I am in all honor's and AP courses and I don't know what to do. My stress levels are through the roof and every time something comes up about school I want to cry. My friends try to help but they can't. All my teachers make me useless and dumb. On top of that I am in the marching band which is an almost all the time commitment and I just feel like crying.

PureSilver108	My grandfather is dying | Over the last three months I have been in Scotland. Basic story is that my grandfather who survived two cancers, still smokes 10+ Cigars a day and drinks a bottle of whiskey is dying of renal failure. If you ever knew my Grandpa you would know he is the most stubborn son of a bitch that ever did exist.  But my main concern is with my grandmother. She has only had one boyfriend and further one husband her entire life, and if you can gather from anything else I have said he controlled their entire relationship for 52 years.  So here I am, a failure son who only came up to their remote house in scotland (literally its 20+ miles away from the nearest village) because my parents couldn't stand me anymore. Trying my hardest to keep my grandma together while I want to go back and fix my fucking life after three months in the boonies,  I dont know what I should do. Abandon all my friends, hope of employment and apprenticeships or look after my grandma. Fuck, I don't know whether I can look after her, I'm a fuck up drunk after all. BTW 20yr M.  
PureSilver108	I agree, all I do is distract myself until i fall asleep with no thoughts at all, usually after 22+ hours
PureSilver108	Hey if you need somebody to chat to there's always this random anonymous person here who feels like I'm in a similar situation to you... Its gonna be okay and life may be shit sometimes but it has its good points too :) 
PureSilver108	Break ups and depression, But a new future | These last 4 years have been hell. I got ill (at 16) with my girlfriend and after four years of being an absolute champ she said she could not deal with me anymore and she had found somebody who could be there for her, loved her and had no mental illness... And this broke me, to pieces, not only the constant barrage of crap that I feel naturally I had this girl which I couldn't get over...  But 7 months on and a new councillor I have actually been able to pick my life up, I have a stable job for the first time in my life, I have quit smoking (Proudest achievement in my life so far) and actually feel ready to a new future so all I can say is so far the past has been crap but I'm a believer in a new future and new loves and a possibly happy life. So thank you to r/Depression! you have helped me through so many tough times but I may have to leave you behind to a new happy future :)  Goodbye, and thank you <3
PureSilver108	Failed and not sure what to do. | I just tried hanging myself and the rope broke, all fun and laughs though. My girlfriend left me due to me being to depressed and I only have one real friend left, and I just unloaded on him now I am terrified I will scare him away like I've scared away my past relationships and family members. Tbh I just don't want to wake up tomorrow and feel the same pain as I do everyday
PureSilver108	Thank you for answering, people like you are indispensable. I know how hard it is for people to deal with suicide and that is part of the reason why I ended up there (good friend). I will try to sleep and hopefully dream of happier things :) Thank you again, im in the after suicide high so I will try to keep this going for a while :)
PureSilver108	I think there is absolutely no harm in doing so, just send them a message and there is almost a 100% chance of them just saying okay, what have they got to lose? I think its a great idea and maybe a chance to reinvigorate your social life. What have you got to lose? As the great shia labeouf once said, just do it! :D
PureSilver108	tbh I feel like you just need to talk about anything and all the things which are bothering you, I feel the same as you and at the moment I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. There are no easy answers and I think you need to take things one step at a time :)  I think talking to the doctors will be a good thing for you it won't give all the answers, and there are usually no ways to get them.  Just work on yourself and ways to improve yourself, and I honestly hope you will be feeling better soon.  Btw I found most jobs to be shitty but thats why we get payed to do them. There is no rush, you're allowed to figure out your life in your own time.
PureSilver108	This whole situation is really fucking unfair, no-one asked for this yet here we are. I personally find that other people that try and helped get hella burned when they step in, but thats just my experience. Personally (not a trained individual) someone else to talk to really helps but i can understand your reluctance when making someone else come in, especially when you know what they will go through. My personal advice is to see someone who can help i.e. a therapist or even talking to someone close to you might help. I feel for your difficult decision and I don't know if I could have been as honest as you. Hope things get better soon
PureSilver108	Its no problem at all :) I think it might be best too, There are 100 and 1 reasons for all of this but somebody that can listen to you and give you helpful advice is beyond comparison. It personally helped me, but I can't proclaim that that is the right thing for all people. I sincerely wish you the best and hope that someday you feel better soon :)
PureSilver108	There is no easy way to stop thinking about it, often I find myself over a bridge and check to see if the fall will kill me, or whether this knife is sharp enough to cut through me. Personally (I'm not a qualified individual) It seems like you probably need to talk to someone, whether a friend, a discreet professional or a family member it is best to just get out with it. However, people can't mind read so don't be too discouraged if they are not as receptive as you wish them to be (especially family) there is nothing wrong with feeling sad when not distracted but I do advice to personally deal with these problems as they you seem fit as they have a habit of compounding and worsening. 
PureSilver108	Thats a horrible situation to be with, I know if I had a child I would want to see them as much as possible, and i really sympathise with your situation. I have felt and am feeling at the moment the same as you are, there is no light at the end of the tunnel and it might just get worse. But tbh it does not matter how much of your life is left, maybe you'll get to see your son more, maybe you won't. What will happen tomorrow? you never know, I know this advice sounds pretty weak and I advise you talk to someone more qualified and closer to you then I am, but life doesn't stay crap, there are too many variables for it to keep going down so look for the up points, and keep going.
PureSilver108	I completely know how you feel, My girlfriend just left me after saying that putting up with me gave her depression (today). But I understand how hard it is to deal with someone which has these problems, that constant stess. But its not my fault, and its not your fault. Fuck this fucking situation. This illness has a tendency to take those we care about and ruin them. But I'm not going to give up, even though I personally want to die so much its choking me. It will get better, i keep chanting this mantra :') sorry for the crappy paragraph, i just want you to know you're not alone. (BTW it really is shitty ain't it)
PureSilver108	I understand why she did though, being with me is shit. However she gave so much to me its hard not to love her unconditionally. especially because she needs me because i gave her mental health problems.   Anyway your advice is spot on and helps an awful lot, and i really appreciate both you and Kostly for talking to me, I think i will survive this night. I will go to the doctors and I will talk to them again about meds. Its just hard to see the light when it keeps getting snuffed out again and again.
PureSilver108	Just remember don't keep putting yourself off till the next time, then the next time :') I don't know how many times I did that.
PureSilver108	Its just the whole thing I told myself, the whole reason for carrying on is that its going to get better. But i'm in a darker place now then i was before. I'm off my medication, and have been for months, my counselor/therapist even agreed with me when i said i beat it. I just can't tell myself the same shit which got me through before.  But hey, i really appreciate your answer. Thank you so much for answering me :') i honestly thought I would be alone in my dingy flat.
PureSilver108	We were really close going through the same kinda shit, but he messaged me when he was going through a bad week and told me he was going to drink car anti-freeze in his flat to try and finish it, he sent me a paragraph as well about how he was sorry for being such a shithead and keeping me down, but he doesn't know that he really helped me. I never heard from him again and we never had details of each other.  If you have any contact details you could always contact his family to try and find out if the worst does happen. If not I'm afraid that you are going to never really know what happened but deal with it like the worse has happened, and im really sorry for you if thats what is going to transpire. I'm really glad that talking to your sister helped :) Its good to have close siblings which can support you but if you still can't cope there is no shame in wanting to get more help, for example from a pro :) I am really glad you are feeling somewhat better and I hope the best happens :)
PureSilver108	I thought I won. | I genuinely did, I've spent the last 6 months of my life free of all of this shit and was moving on. I got a job, I finished college, my room was fucking tidy for the first time in the last 4 years.  But then the realisation started creeping in, you know that job which you got, well they don't want you anymore. You know those grades, well you fucked up because you were trying to do everything else at the same time, fix these last couple years of being a fuck up. You know that girlfriend that helped you through all this shit, well turns out you fucked up her head badly by relying on her and now it turns out she fucking hates you and has been making out with her best friend. My room is still tidy though.  I really don't see the fucking point anymore. I tried my hardest, I didn't kill myself for the people who cared about me and the fact they told me the future would be better. I really did give my all and now I have nothing. The future is bleak and I'm not as sure I can last this one.
PureSilver108	Are you sure you didn't take too many, with some of my sleep meds they didn't seem to work straight away or at all. Anyway its my advice not to take too many at all and if you feel like you need to talk to someone about what you are going through, and tbh it seems like you are going through a really shitty situation. But there is always somebody there for you, even if you've never talked to them before.
PureSilver108	I hope it turns out alright, but remember there is always somebody to talk too here. A year ago a friend of mine who was going through the same thing committed suicide, we only ever talked online as well. That being said life as a habit of throwing the spanner in the works and you never know what has happened. I honestly wish all the best, I personally recommend talking to someone close to you about this whole situation, it always turned out to help me talking to someone (even if they gave shitty advice, having someone listen is worth it) I really wish you the best. 
PureSilver108	The reason I started, a cruel torture to me when I am feeling better. Now I am both poorer and more likely to die of cancer. Its morbidly funny in a way.
PureSilver108	Are you okay? You never know what is going through somebody elses head :/ But there is nothing wrong with both hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. Personally when i've been suicidal I would only want people to know after it happened, due to the pain lying to you that it is best this way and other people may stop you. I honestly hope your friend is okay.
FuckJewDank	I hate the change of growing up. | Incoming wall of text. I just needed to type these words out.    I don't know what I'm doing in my life. I'm 25, a college graduate, I have an apartment with my girlfriend, have a pet that I love dearly, a great family and maybe 2 good friends that I see maybe once every 2 weeks. I absolutely despise my job. I have to deal with the most brain dead people in the world, every day non stop. I have no energy. I barely can go to work, but i was taught just to push through the tough times. The no energy is making me become out of shape. I know I'm not obese by any means, but I'm definitely fat. I feel like I'm developing an eating disorder. I used to be a pretty popular kid. In high school I would hang out with my friends 6 nights a week. In college I had a great group of friends and had the time of my life for 4 years away at a school that I absolutely loved. That was the happiest I ever was. Now I maybe go out once every 2-3 weeks and have no hobbies.   My family is great and lives in the same town as me ,but Ironically I think my love for them is what's holding me back in my life. I already feel like I'm seeing them age at crazy speeds. I'm afraid if I move away, I'll never really get to see them again.   My brother is 28, my best friend, and lives at home. He's never had a girlfriend to my knowledge. Despite the fact he has a lot of friends and a great social life (definitely more active than me) he never seems to want to grow up. He's had an eating disorder since he was a kid. Hes afraid to try 80% of foods put in front of him. He has a diet of a 5th grader. I used to be affect with this until I was about 14-15, but luckily I forced myself to try new things. I feel like if I move away I will lose touch with him and won't help him grow out of this lifestyle.   My girlfriend is the best thing to happen to me. We met at college and We've been together for 3 years, broke up once for a month. I barely even have the energy to have sex with her. I basically have to force myself to become aroused once a week so I can at least say we had sex this week. I know this is crushing her on the inside. She's told me multiple times. I used to smoke once in a while just as a change up from drinking, but ever since I moved in with her, Ive become an everyday smoker. I think deep down I despise that she made me this dependent on marijuana. She wants to move away from our state and she's determine to do it. I feel like our relationship is on a time clock until she moves away while I stay here with my family.   I have no idea why but I despise the thought of the future. I'm afraid that my parents will pass away. I'm afraid my brother will never grow up into an adult. I'm afraid that I will lose my girlfriend and be alone for my life. It's starting to consume me and I can't escape these thoughts. I don't think anyone knows this.
FuckJewDank	She reminds me of Maisie Williams if Maisie Williams was hot 
FuckJewDank	Pick me
FuckJewDank	Man you gotta get over the average dick thing. 
FuckJewDank	I do that basically every time I'm hungover. It for real makes me want to die 
FuckJewDank	What a tale 
FuckJewDank	JennaSienna@MyFreeCams.com
FuckJewDank	S A D B O Y E
FuckJewDank	I wish I loved anything as much as Randy Gregory loves weed 
FuckJewDank	Might have to make another username soon 
FuckJewDank	Hi
FuckJewDank	And everybody all around the wooooooorld
FuckJewDank	I'm just here for the bamboozle 
FuckJewDank	PFT?
litaddict	Coffee is great | Mornings are difficult,  but after a cup of coffee it's like I'm a regular person.  Its ability to lift me up is  like nothing else. Anyone else thank the stars for their coffee? 
litaddict	This is definitely a dark place to hang out. For that reason,  I think a lot of people who are trying to get better,  or start to feel better on their own,  avoid coming here. During my dips of depression I find myself coming to reddit,  but during my up periods I don't have so much of a reason to, or I don't want to bring myself back down.  So just because you don't see people posting about getting better or trying to get better doesn't mean it's not happening. It just means they're not using this sub to talk about it. 
litaddict	A single cup of coffee in the morning? Hardly. 
litaddict	Enjoying something is not the same as being dependent on it. 
litaddict	Seriously. PC is a breeding ground for drama. 
litaddict	I'm so tired of almost being run over by tourists on Divvies. Is tourist season over yet? 
litaddict	I hated it so much. It got to the point where I would start berating people (usually young men) for blatantly taking photos of me when I was just trying to live my life. 
litaddict	I haven't spent a fall in Chicago yet. I see that there are quite a few Oktoberfests going on this weekend,  so which tend to be the best for music, beer selection,  and overall liveliness? 
litaddict	The Green Mill and House of Blues are both pretty great and have music every night. 
litaddict	Comedy club? Live music? 
litaddict	Don't you mean ex-boyfriend? 
litaddict	Senior when we were freshman. Charismatic, charming,  the works. Also a compulsive liar. All my friends fell for his bullshit,  but I saw through it. Eventually they all saw the light,  but not before being hurt. AFAIK he's still manipulating women. 
litaddict	Do you think sprog is just one person who spends all day creating beautiful art,  or many poets who trade shifts?
litaddict	Do men actually say that to you?? I would definitely kick them in the balls if they said that to me. 
litaddict	Seriously,  I don't understand how people make this mistake. It's like they're combining "wary" and "leery". 
litaddict	I actually love being an adult. Having a couple drinks and going home early is great. And not giving a fuck if people think I'm lame for it. 
litaddict	"Eating meat is immoral." 
litaddict	It's so confusing. I need to find a new doctor for the first time in my life,  and I don't understand it. I have a few things I want to get checked out,  so do I go for a general consultation? Is that a normal thing to do? Also,  do I just show up at the office,  ask if they're taking new patients,  and say,  "Sign me up"? I don't get it. 
litaddict	For me it's how gross my sponges get,  very quickly. Sucks not having a dishwasher. 
litaddict	Trying to figure out how health insurance works. Ugh. 
litaddict	Being excited to get home early and go to sleep instead of raging all night. 
litaddict	I'm in Chicago and there's a tax on grocery bags,  so I'm actually running into the problem of not having ENOUGH grocery bags. I took a bunch from my parents' house last time I visited. 
litaddict	I need adult Lunchables. So sick of preparing work lunches. 
litaddict	That's what I did today! 
litaddict	I also take the pill continuously and never have a period. It's a beautiful life. 
litaddict	Bloating. It's uncomfortable and makes you look fat. And then you fart a lot. 
litaddict	If he's not carrying it for 9 months and pushing it out at the end,  he's not pregnant. 
litaddict	Posting because OP may be interested. There's a great memoir called Half a Life by Darin Strauss. It's about how he accidentally killed a classmate when he was a teenager and how it affected his life afterward. I highly recommend it. 
litaddict	I say this a lot...sorry.
litaddict	Chicken tenders. 
litaddict	Gotta be careful though. I went vegetarian and gained weight because I replaced protein with carbs. 
litaddict	"Ew, McDonald's is so gross."   Get over it. It's tasty and cheap. 
litaddict	Moved to a new city and started throwing myself into social events to meet people and make friends. It was really difficult because I'm a textbook introvert,  but it was worth it. 
litaddict	Yep. No car,  no house,  no pets, no kids. 
litaddict	Oh,  we are not content with it. We just have no other option unless we marry a European and never go back to the US. 
litaddict	Doesn't do shit most of the week, and the one day he does he brags about how productive he was. All the while I've been picking up the slack.   Okay,  it mainly just annoys me. 
litaddict	4 sucks. There's way fewer things to do. 
litaddict	I think McDonald's is delicious,  and assume anyone who looks down on it is a pretentious asshole. 
litaddict	That's gonna be rough. I have a tiny studio in Old Town for $830, but my commute to the loop is only 25 min door to door. 
litaddict	I'm sure the US isn't spending billions in taxpayer money to support those other states,  though. 
litaddict	Your description almost made me cry. For me it's a completely dark, empty room.
litaddict	I get you. I feel the same way. 
litaddict	It's creeping back into my life... | I'm not expecting anyone to read this, but somehow I just need to get it out there.  I'm not anywhere as depressed as I used to be. The last couple years of college were the worse. I almost didn't graduate because I couldn't bring myself to get up and go to class in the morning. Nothing mattered to me, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship that really brought me down, I started considering the easiest way to end things.  Things got significantly better after graduation (which only happened through some extremely kind intervention by the dean of students and a couple understanding professors). I moved abroad for a while, and altogether I've lived just over three years outside the US until I moved back for good last year.   In May I moved to a new city for a job, and I'm still really happy I did. But it's really hard to make new friends as an adult, and it's been lonely. This summer I started actively dating, having not really dated since the breakup with the abusive ex 5 years ago. They say you know you're ready to date when you don't feel like you HAVE to, and that's how I felt. But I feel like it's making me lonelier. I feel like I can't make a real connection with anyone.   I thought for the last couple weeks that I was connecting with someone. It was someone I met socially through a group I'm involved with, and he seemed genuinely interested in me, pursuing me, asking me questions about myself. We have a lot in common, moreso than anyone I've dated in a long time. But the other night we were hanging out, and when I finally got up the courage to kiss him, something changed. He quite literally said immediately after, "So your place or mine?" And even though it felt dirty and demeaning, I went back to his apartment and had an awkward night with him. I felt betrayed, and I'm mad at myself for going through with it. And this wouldn't have happened if I didn't feel so damn lonely here. I won't pretend it was my first hookup. I've had my share of one-night stands. But I never regretted it afterward. I never went through with something I didn't really want to do. And I'm ashamed of doing that the other night.  At times like this my first reaction is to start looking for opportunities to work outside the US. But I'm getting to the point in my life where I have to be serious and think about my future. And I worked so hard to get this job in this city, to have some stability, that I can't fathom throwing that away right now.  But even worse...I can feel the darkness creeping back. It's getting a little harder every morning to drag myself out of bed to go to work, and it'll only be worse as winter approaches. I find myself thinking when my alarm goes off, "What if I just call in this one time?" The thought never lasts more than a second or two, but I don't know how long I can hold it off. I'm afraid I'm going to fall back down that hole and lose everything I've worked for, disappoint myself and my family, have to start from scratch again.  And I'm not helping myself by reaching for these "real connections" that turn out to be nothing but an attempt to get in my jeans.  My chest feels heavy all the time now, and that worries me. I know that feeling, and it never brings anything good to my life.
litaddict	Lou Malnati's over Giordano's. You need the butter crust. Also,  Lagunitas isn't a Chicago company,  so maybe check out one of the local breweries? 
litaddict	I just saw a straight-up propaganda ad for the soda tax...paid for by Michael Bloomberg. Wtf? 
litaddict	Agreed. I wore sneakers with my skirts every day to school,  and that would not fly in the US. I was also in East Africa,  BTW. 
litaddict	I didn't miss having to make sure my clothes match before leaving the house,  or having to wash my hair every day. Or making sure my shoes go with my outfit. 
litaddict	Summer camps,  traveling,  drinking,  and reading a looooot. 
litaddict	Maybe your god should stop making people depressed. That might help. 
litaddict	I think you're describing actual torture. Dear Lord. 
litaddict	I taught high school,  so I probably would have been pretty honest and tell them I don't like him,  but leave it at that. 
litaddict	I really like Guthrie's. It's pretty chill, and the beer menu's pretty good. And they have board games. 
litaddict	Where can I go to listen to live jazz, but be able to also talk to my date (meaning talking is allowed and the music isn't obscenely loud)? 
litaddict	I majored in Spanish and ended up in Africa. Then again,  I applied back when you couldn't apply for certain countries or sectors. 
litaddict	Not true. It depends highly on the program. On the other hand,  being an RPCV makes it more likely to get funding other than Coverdell.
litaddict	Is requesting a site change an option? 
litaddict	I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm sure eventually some of them will come around once they've come to terms with your decision. And your fellow PCVs will always be supportive :) 
litaddict	This comment is so Peace Corps. We are dirty people. 
litaddict	I agree with this so hard. 
litaddict	I was well-integrated in my community because it was small enough that everyone knew who I was,  even if I didn't necessarily know all of them. It was challenging every day,  but it forced me to grow like I wouldn't have if I had lived in a nice apartment with WiFi and AC.   In short,  I was looking for the classic Peace Corps experience. I didn't have to haul water from a river and I had electricity 80% of the time,  so it wasn't like living in a hut or anything. But it was a challenge,  and a worthwhile one.   Congrats and good luck! If you have questions,  feel free to PM me. 
litaddict	The tap in my compound would come on MAYBE once or twice a week,  and I'd fill up a couple big jerry cans. It really taught me how to conserve and make priorities with water.  #1: drinking,  #2 cooking/cleaning dishes,  #3 washing my hair,  #4 washing the rest of me,  and #5 washing clothes. I was not able to get to #4-5 as often as a wish. 
litaddict	I don't know,  but Ethiopia was not one of them. Not by a long shot. And I'm okay with that. I feel like I got the experience I was looking for. 
litaddict	You should join the Peace Corps Ethiopia Facebook group (the one that includes invitees is Peace Corps Ethiopia! with the exclamation mark). And you should create a group for your cohort!
litaddict	Exactly. As I saw it,  it made my entire experience easier and saved my sanity to travel to cities once in a while for a hot shower and WiFi. I didn't save as much as some people,  but I still had enough. It made me happy to spend my money that way,  and it helped me make it through service. 
litaddict	That's very helpful,  but I don't see why you had to be so mean to OP. I had no idea that existed,  and he/she probably didn't either. 
litaddict	Wisconsin also uses property taxes to pay for schools,  FYI. 
litaddict	I'm not sure that anyone is trying to excuse the violence by pointing out that it's worse in other places. I think it's fair to defend the city when so many claim it's the most violent place in the US. 
litaddict	Working all day,  but at least the train wasn't crowded this morning. 
litaddict	I'd say troll USA jobs and see what interests you. I was really interested in getting a federal job and applied a bunch of places. I ended up with USCIS and couldn't be happier. 
litaddict	There were a lot of little ones,  but a big one was having four of my students be junior counselors for Camp GLOW. 
litaddict	I'm less than a year out,  but I'm working for USCIS and I love it. I could see myself staying in this agency indefinitely. 
litaddict	Most adorable abduction ever. 
litaddict	Hello from 181
litaddict	There's a difference between calling yourself a dyke and being called a dyke because someone hates you. 
litaddict	It's not really moving. I'm sitting between two stations still. Ugh. 
litaddict	It's a really cool exhibit. Highly recommend checking it out. 
litaddict	Honestly this fest was such a ripoff. Pay $20 just to get in,  then wait in line for a half hour in the blazing sun for what was often mediocre food. 
litaddict	Streets blocked off downtown? | I heard a woman jumped from a parking structure onto a car. Does anyone know more?   Edit: Near Washington/Wells. 
litaddict	Holy shit, this almost brought me to tears. I hope you're okay. Thank you for sharing. 
litaddict	W Madison,  near Washington /Wells stop. 
litaddict	Do you know which street and parking structure? 
litaddict	It's never nice to leave kids out,  but you could consider doing an application and limiting the number of students who can participate. That's what we had to do for all our camps. 
litaddict	25% is actually about the average throughout PC. 
litaddict	My job is not nearly that cool,  but someday! 
litaddict	I'm planning to go to Printer's Row Lit Fest, though maybe not what you're looking for, haha. 
litaddict	No way you're going to change the world. I feel like I made a positive impact in the lives of a handful of people,  and that's enough for me. 
litaddict	Working for USCIS,  and feeling so lucky for it. Of all the federal agencies,  this is one I feel passionately about. 
litaddict	Does anyone know if there's going to be AN Ethiopian fest this year? 
litaddict	I'm from Milwaukee,  and it's still the Sears Tower. 
litaddict	It's not...but my building manager seems really great so far, so I'm optimistic. 
litaddict	Oh yeah, but worth it. 
litaddict	I've been eating SO MUCH ASPARAGUS lately. So delicious. 
litaddict	I'm moving into a garden apt in Lincoln Park this week.  Here's hoping it's just as good. 
litaddict	As a Wisconsinite newly moved to Chicago, this whole post and the comments warmed my heart. Thanks for all the Wisco love,  guys! 
litaddict	Use gen.lib.rus.ec for ebooks! 
litaddict	Rocky's is a chain,  you can find them in a bunch of places around the Milwaukee area! 
litaddict	You really can't know for sure. I accepted an invitation to be a teacher trainer,  and then they switched my program to secondary school EFL. 
litaddict	Cooking materials are a great idea! 
litaddict	I also have a picture book to my family, but I think the scenery was so outside of what they were familiar with that it kind of flopped...they didn't seem that interested. 
litaddict	I appreciate this. I understand why others find it condescending because I would have too a few years ago. When you're in a really dark place,  it seems like that's all there is. But I got out of it too. There are times when it seems like the black is creeping in again,  but I've been able to hold it back for 5 years now. I've done things I never thought I could do. So it is possible,  even if not inevitable. 
ebbandflow96	I keep hearing about "terfs" on this sub, what do they even believe in? Can anyone give me a quick summary?
ebbandflow96	This is also my title. I'm suing you for copyright infringement. 
ebbandflow96	10 days ago I attempted suicide.. I'm already feeling miserable and hopeless again. | 10 days ago I attempted to kill myself by taking a box of sleeping pills. I was in the hospital for hours then sent to an inpatient program . The inpatient program was a complete joke. I wasn't even allowed to see a doctor until I got my mother to come down and demand I see one(Legally I should be able to see one within 24 hours) After finally getting to see a doctor, and what I thought would be the start of dealing with my problems, I was released. He told me at inpatient programs there wasn't any real progress to be made there job is to stabilize you then you are supposed to go and seek actual therapy outside by yourself. He deemed I was ready to go out and seek help already. So I got out and I went on my insurance website and have tried to get in touch with therapists and after a cancellation and an attempted reschedule by the first(ended up not having matching availability)  I'm just playing phone tag with others now. I called last Friday to schedule an appointment to the most recent place. Didn't get a response until Tuesday and the response was just basic information which they said they will verify and then they will contact me with a list of therapists I can actually try and set up an appointment with. Today is now Saturday so I assume the earliest I will hear from them is Monday and then I get to play phone tag over the next week with the actual office, whom then will schedule me a once a week appointment in a week or two.   That is my current situation so before you say "Go get help OP you just have to try!" I am trying and at this time I literally can't get help any faster.   After my suicide attempt I had a brief moment of motivation to actually try and do something about my giant mountain of problems. No I didn't have some profound clarity about how life is actually amazing. I just wanted to not feel like shit for a day or two. Didn't even believe it would happen, I just allowed myself to want it to for a change. All of that is gone though. I've only received the bill for the ambulance ride from the ER to the inpatient facility and the ER stay and its almost 3 grand. Me and my family literally struggle to buy toilet paper and groceries. I already have hospital debt that is close to 2 grand. The inpatient facility charges a little over 2 grand from what I've read online. I haven't been able to work for over a year due to extreme anxiety attacks and depression. Even after I find a therapist I don't know how I will be able to get to the sessions or pay for them. Getting a job seems impossible for me. I have no car, no recent work experience, and have literally no social skills. I'm not diagnosed but I'm positive I have some form of autism. All-In-All I'm utterly hopeless. It costs money to try and get better, it costs money to stay alive, and I am unable to make money myself. On top of that my mother is being forced to pay for me when she can barely afford to pay for herself. I'm literally killing her.   So I tried to sell my body to someone last night. They did what they did and then just left. I didn't even get paid for what I forced myself to do. I'm disgusting and hopeless. Now I can't help but want to die again.   You can give me the talk on how suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but me being unable to function as a normal human isn't something that is temporary. If I had a well off family that was able to take care of me and get me a lot of help then maybe I could find some kind of assisted living where I can at least psuedo-function but I come from a poor family where supporting me means not supporting themselves. So I will receive no help. I'm all out of options and am already contemplating if I should make another attempt. It's only been 10 fucking days and I just want to die again. I feel like I've wanted to cry to past couple days but my body just wont. All the stress is going to drive me insane. I just want to not be here anymore.
ebbandflow96	> Life's tough.  If my life is so shit and I'm not getting anything out of it, with no future prospects on top of that, then why even have one? You are right. Life is tough. Life is too tough. It's why I don't want to be alive anymore. I have no idea how you are able to cope day to day knowing what you are, and being helpless to change that fact, but I can't take it. I feel like my head is going to explode. At least with a successful suicide I won't have to feel anything ever again. No more worry, no more frustration. Just complete nothingness.
ebbandflow96	[Unfortunately she is in fact pretty cute](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&bih=659&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Hoshinomori%2C+Chiaki&oq=Hoshinomori%2C+Chiaki&gs_l=psy-ab.3...0.0.0.8396.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.fwDwhaAmbTQ)  
ebbandflow96	At that price this character has 2500usd worth of games sitting on her floor. Or close to 30 bucks at your local gamestop!
ebbandflow96	I've briefly looked at NAMI there is nothing close enough. My county has one free program but you have to be homeless for so many days before you can join. I've called my crisis line countless times. They are no help at all. They tell me to check with my insurance. Which is what I did and am currently doing. Literally all I can do right now is just sit and wait until I can get a response from the place I'm currently trying to talk to, then I see how much the copays are and if their availability lines up with mine(no car so I only have small windows where I can use my moms unless the office happens to be in walking distance). If not I have to continue going down the list until I find someone I can talk to. It's just days and days of waiting so someone will listen to me complain.  
ebbandflow96	She's not helping me pay off any kind of debt. She's letting me live with her and feeding me. My mother is the only person I have ever came close to loving, if she were to die I would kill myself immediately because then there would be truly no reason for me to be alive, but I think me dying would actually be very beneficial to her, which I've told her. If I were no longer around she wouldn't struggle financially so much. She could spend her 40's trying to move out of this apartment into a one bedroom place or save up to finally get a decent car that isn't constantly having problems instead of having to try and keep me alive. I have no talents or skills. Where I live everyone knows me, I'm the town crazy person, if I were to try to beg for money I would just be laughed at and mocked.   My mom is the only person who cares about me;however, I really think she would be better off if I was dead. I'm just a parasite. A leech feeding off her. The only way I can make anything better for her would be to just disappear somehow. If anything staying alive and continuing to feed off of her is just an insult to how hard she tried for me. She's feeding all of her time and money into a pointless cause when she could be bettering her own life.   Tbh I don't see any reason not to kill myself. I think it would make the world a better place for the one person it would actually affect.
ebbandflow96	Other then the starts the city is better in every way.
ebbandflow96	you monster..
ebbandflow96	original content machine broke
ebbandflow96	Playing with people 2 ranks below you and 2 ranks above you is normal though. The fact that it was four low gold 5 players is actually pretty good.
ebbandflow96	I work here my life is already shit enough tyvm
ebbandflow96	Amazon, it is where I bought all of my wigs. It will tell you who is shipping as well, most of the time Amazon themselves ship it so it won't say "GirlyGirl Wigs" on the package or anything like that.   Or soon Halloween stores will be popping up. If you are afraid of someone you know noticing or unable to buy things online you can just drive to a nearby town and go to one of those stores.   Sense Halloween is coming up it's an easy excuse if someone somehow does notice as well. No way you would ever want to look cute and girly, you just want to be a bad ass samurai for a day :p
ebbandflow96	http://www.mangabb.co/boku-no-hero-academia/chapter-59/13 read that page and also the next one.   What I'm saying is that after you give One-For-All to the next person you start dying. So if Deku thinks Mirio is more deserving and wants to give him OFA it would mean killing himself in the process.   Edit: When or why he passes OFA to the next person is beyond me. But why I'm pointing it out is because I think All-Might is dying and Deku wanting to give away the quirk to Mirio would force All-Might to tell Deku about that. 
ebbandflow96	Actually after further research I've learned depression isn't a gender, so I've settled with female :p  Anytime though!
ebbandflow96	the sooner you start the better chance you have (:
ebbandflow96	I don't believe so, I could be wrong though. 
ebbandflow96	I'm pretty sure he is dying though. That is what Gran Torino was referring to when he got mad at All Might for not telling Deku something specific about One For All. Give me a sec and I'll find the pages to support my crazy theory :p
ebbandflow96	Deku wanting to give his quirk to Mirio would force All-Might to tell Deku that transferring one-for-all kills you! At least that is what I think All-Might can't tell Deku...
ebbandflow96	Before you sat down and decided it did you ever have any kind of natural attraction to either sex?
ebbandflow96	Why did you guys feel that making some of the challenges require you to be in a premade was necessary? I personally was annoyed that you had to have a full group of 5 and don't really see why you guys and girls added in that prerequisite for the missions. Couldn't the missions still have been just as challenging if you had done them in Solo Que? For me the only thing I could guess was you were trying to raise the difficulty of the challenge by getting a 5-man together, but that doesn't sit right with me, I feel like there has to be a better reason. Were you just trying to push the Team thematic of the two star guardian squads? 
ebbandflow96	post a picture! Let us see!
ebbandflow96	I'm pretty sure that Riot confirmed that it wasn't what they had planned but were open to crossovers if it made sense in the future. 
ebbandflow96	Why did you guys make Ahri and Ezreal's hair blonde with only a little bit of their color mixed in. Was it just overlapping with other star guardians? If that is the case why did you do Syndra and Janna both purple? 
ebbandflow96	How come Ezreal didn't get a skirt too?
ebbandflow96	To be fair Lucian is only that good as a counter pick into certain champs. A blind pick Lucian isn't A to S tier. At least from what I've seen in pro, which I assume really high elo resembles.
ebbandflow96	upvoted for using "feel feels"
ebbandflow96	Everyone is going to argue about this because the person is trans but imagine if this happened to someone who was cis gender. If a security officer assumes a lady took something and put it in her bra does she have to undress? If a guy is a accused of stealing should he have to strip down? The answer is no. Don't let the word "trans" make you irrational please.
ebbandflow96	It's a pretty new thing! I saw it for the first time like a month ago and thought "where has this been all my life"
ebbandflow96	/s is what you are looking for
ebbandflow96	Hi I'm the friend please love me
ebbandflow96	I can't wait until HRT completely destroys my sex drive. I don't want to wake up hating myself because my body does the same stupid thing every morning and the only way I can stop it is looking at that crap. Why is there no cute vanilla porn for people like me? Why does it all have to be "serve him slut, you're just a sex whole?" Why can't it just be "This person thinks you are beautiful and here is a scenario of you two treating each other with respect and making each other feel good?" It's stupid and I can't stand it.
ebbandflow96	It can still be invisible girl though. She could theoretically have found a way to spy on the meeting and ran there before the hero's showed up, right? This could explain why she was only able to just tell them. She only was able to get in and hear the second meeting so she was only given a short amount of time to go warn them.   Also would explain why we wouldn't see her with the villians, she could be hiding or could have easily slipped by the heros after telling them.   Also sense we are on the topic, how do we know Hagakure is even a teenager? Sense nobody has ever seen her, and with the right voice, she could easily just lie about her age to blend in as a school student. AFO could have taken the quirk from someone and just given it to any female goon and sent her to go undercover when he caught word that All-Might was heading to UA to look for a potential new candidate for OFA.
ebbandflow96	Thank you! I hope so too (:
ebbandflow96	I have my first appointment with a therapist tomorrow to try and get my letter of recommendation for an endo. So it will probably still be a little while but at least I'm starting the process (:
ebbandflow96	My mic conveniently breaks when I meet new people :p
ebbandflow96	(Spoilers!!)What do you think Bakugo will think of... | What do you think Bakugo will think of Mirio now? Do you think he will look down on him?
ebbandflow96	Yea! He wasn't there but I feel like he should know about them! He wants to be the best so someone like "the big 3" I feel like would draw his attention. And after how he looked down on Deku for not having a quirk I want to see how he thinks of someone who now doesn't have a quirk that he saw as really strong before. And I just want to know what he thinks about the entire situation in general. Do you think he thinks Mirio's sacrifice was worth it? Or maybe he thinks Mirio is dumb for doing what he did. Ugh I wanna know so bad!
ebbandflow96	If it does I'll stop coming here :p
ebbandflow96	Yea that what everyone is telling me lol. I guess I just had them over hyped in my head. I feel like society just lost little All Might. 
ebbandflow96	Surely he has heard of him, they are well known in the school. Even if Bakugo never actually talks to him about it I would love to know what he thinks about everything.
ebbandflow96	I'm still upset he isn't wearing a skirt. I'm not sure if I'll ever let it go..
ebbandflow96	Cat girls are always best girls you heathen. 
ebbandflow96	Yea and I really want to just see how much he has grown as a person after everything with Deku and All Might. I wanna see the differences from how he used to treat someone without a quirk, Deku, to now with Mirio.
ebbandflow96	Whaaaaat I feel like Izuku and him are basically friends by now. And I see it as Bakugo is on the freshman team and Mirio is one of the stars on Varsity. Sense Bakugo strives to be in that position I feel like he might not have actually been introduced but he would at least know about him.   Also I'm sure this is going to be huge for the hero world and U.A. specifically! If Bakugo doesn't know him now I'm sure he will hear all about him soon.
ebbandflow96	close enough, I mean [just look at her] (http://media.comicbook.com/2017/08/star-guardian-skins-1014688.jpg).
ebbandflow96	I always try the good old "Hey think I could get a gank? (:"  if they say no you give them a quick no worries and continue on with your lane.
ebbandflow96	True the younger generation did just hear about "the big 3" so the name must not be that popular. It's probably more of just a nickname among the older students to say those are the strongest among them. I kind of saw it more of like College football stars where the whole town knows them, because look at how much attention even the freshman got after the tournament. I guess if Deku, the huge hero nerd, barely knew of him it would make sense that Bakugo hasn't ever heard of him yet.   Either way I'm still interested to see what he thinks of everything even if it is from just hearing about it on the news. I wonder if they will treat a student losing a quirk like they did when the villains attacked the training camp. Do you think this will be televised and actually be a huge deal or it will be kept under wraps?
ebbandflow96	"How do you deal with people you don't agree with?" Then a follow up question of "What do you think of Muslims and/or gay/trans people?"
ebbandflow96	Is there a way I can stop a specific song from ever auto-playing and/or block a video from even appearing in my suggested? | I absolutely can't stand swish swish by Katy Perry. If you like it, good for you, that is your thing but I would prefer to never hear it again if I don't have to. I made a post in this sub awhile ago asking the same thing and was told to dislike the song and it would stop it from playing inside of mixes but I don't ever listen to mixes. I will type in a song I like then let it autoplay, assuming that the next songs will be similar. But here recently if I put on any pop song Swish Swish is one of the next 3 songs. Taylor Swift, Kesha, Demi Lavato, Tove Stryke, Blackbear, and many more somehow always lead me to Swish Swish and then a non stop playlist of either just Katy Perry or whatever the recent big radio songs are. What is so annoying about this is I don't like Katy Perry in general, she is one of my least favorite pop artists but she is brought into my auto play the most. So is there a way I can block all songs by Katy Perry, specific videos or anything with a certain phrase in the title to never be showed to me again?
ebbandflow96	Nobody is forcing you to read this either :p If you hate posts like these so much stop complaining and move on!   So you know I'm not trying to be mean I'm just trying to point out you are complaining about complaining, which people are allowed to do, and excepted to do with gaming companies. They want our feedback. Sometimes that feedback is negative. 
ebbandflow96	I think it is because they put everything into bundles. That is what frustrates me at least. Want the Syndra icon? You have to buy the Syndra skin, border and icon.
ebbandflow96	I just wish you didn't have to buy both. I don't want the icon and if they really want to charge 175 rp for the broder I have to live with that but they forced all of the content into bundles to make you buy stuff you don't want so you can get the stuff you do want. It's kind of frustrating /:

ebbandflow96	Where I live, California, the average person does smoke weed. They are absolutely not more violent, intolerant or impulsive. I have to question how much exposure you've had to people who do the drug based on what you are saying. If you were arguing against alcohol then maybe I could get on board with it makes people more aggressive, impulsive and intolerant. But even then I think your views are more aimed at people who use drugs irresponsibly or already have underlying mental health issues. 
ebbandflow96	Well not necessarily. If I think the best color is blue and your favorite is orange then we would have to say we didn't 'agree with' each other. Sense there isn't a technical right answer here we just have to accept that fact we have different opinions.  I do think I get what you are saying though. For certain things we will use the phrase "people you don't agree with" to politely say "people you hold irrational bias towards." I could say "How do you think we should treat people you hate, like maybe Muslims or gay/trans people?" But I don't think it is very tactful. It almost forces confrontation and I would rather not do that. If I can I would like to steer any conversation I have into a polite one.
ebbandflow96	Teenage trans girls and cis girls are both girls though. I understand if you are unable to see them that way; however, they view themselves as normal girls with a medical condition they need to fix. So giving them a separate magazine from "normal" girls would be insulting to them.  Tons of gay teens read those magazines as well. Sure this one article might be more geared towards a particular group of readers but I don't think the other readers shouldn't be showed this content.    Teen vogue covers sexual content all the time. They released a guide on how to masturbate and nobody cared. In my opinion if a teen girl can read that she can read about anal sex as well.   I think a lot of this comes down to a stigma around anal sex and the idea that people who participate in it are lesser. A lot of people don't want girls to be exposed to it because they don't want their daughter doing it, not because it is actually offensive or inappropriate for the audience in anyway.  So to wrap up my little rant I would like to say a 16 year old girl, in my opinion, is definitely mature enough to read an article about anal sex, and if she wants to go ahead and do that, that is her choice, at least now she can do it safely!
ebbandflow96	I'm pretty sure this is a /s, I hope it is.   But if it is not you are very misinformed about what marijuana does to the average person. 
ebbandflow96	I just got back home after being stuck in an inpatient facility for a suicide attempt. It definitely solves absolutely nothing. 
ebbandflow96	So I agree that it can negatively affect kids if it is abused as a recreational drug, just like alcohol, Xanax or Ritalin, however these drugs are abused by kids just as much and Xanax and Ritalin are also given to kids by doctors and nobody complains. Most of the kids who are legally getting marijuana are doing it for epilepsy, cancer or some other serious illness where the trade offs are more then worth it.   Almost any drug can be abused that doesn't mean that they can't still have overall positives if used correctly.   
ebbandflow96	What about trans girls and gay teens, how else are they supposed to have sex, don't they deserve sexual education as well?   And "sodomy laws" were literally just targeting gay people, in 2003 they were repealed by the supreme court.   quick after thought Edit: we disagree and I even insulted your opinion a little bit with my sarcastic comment, thank you for your polite response!
ebbandflow96	Teens are learning about sex!? Why!? If we never tell them about it they will never do it!!! /s
ebbandflow96	I think the government should without a doubt be able to make money off of doing things they are supposed to do in order for them to continue helping people. Like seat belt tickets or when someone runs a red light. A fine and maybe strike on your license is an appropriate response. They have to be able to pay their bills and it helps people make smarter decisions in the future.   I am all for regulation and making sure it is used responsibly, just like alcohol, my problem is it victimizes people who aren't doing anything wrong in order to make money.
ebbandflow96	You are thinking of alcohol actually! The one that is perfectly legal and has been for awhile!
ebbandflow96	That is why marijuana is still illegal, yes. But also one of the main reasons why it shouldn't be. Just because the government can make money off of it doesn't mean they should. You could fine someone everyday they missed work because they aren't contributing to society that day but is it a good idea? Fuck no it isn't.
ebbandflow96	Well we wasted money before so who cares if we continue wasting money!
ebbandflow96	The number 1 way of illegal immigration is by plane. They don't ever have to toss it over any walls. Any actual big time drug smuggler is going on with business as usual if a wall is put up.
ebbandflow96	like a dream? I guess. I feel really light. my stomach hurts a lot. my head is starting to hurt. i cant decide if i want to puke of just go to bed. i almost feel asleep on the floor. I still want to die. I was hoping it would be a lot faster then this. I also need more alcohol. Also I've discorded that my toilet smells like poop. i dont want to talk but i do. i want to be part of a conversation but i dont want to talk if that makes any sense.  Edit: after rereading my own reply im worried i might be incoherent 
ebbandflow96	the dirties
ebbandflow96	hi
ebbandflow96	thanks but you are right. Im not looking for help and ive already taken them. Thanks for the positive thoughts, you tried, no reason to feel guilty
ebbandflow96	i already did it.  I took about 30 of them. ithink one might have already been used. what should i expect?
ebbandflow96	Some games already do this! Blade and Soul is an MMO that does it yearly and the creations are always really cool. They even let each region create there own personal skin.
ebbandflow96	Emotional problems, lack of social skills and lack of money to have friends.   I had quite a few friends in school and the ones that didn't move away still hang out from what I see on social media, but my depression and anxiety just make me a chore to bring along. I have no self confidence and I am constantly in a state of panic in any kind of social setting, this inhibits what they can do and they end up having to appease me. It frustrates them and makes me feel like shit. So it's better if I don't hang out with them. It's been a couple years at this point so I wouldn't even consider them acquaintances anymore.  Trying to find new friends is almost impossible for someone like me, when I do leave the house it is for as short a time as humanly possible, I'm unable to look anyone in the eye, and even if someone does come up to me and try to talk to me I just frantically push them away so they don't have to actually get to know me. I'm not exactly a functioning healthy person and the faster they know that the faster they will just look down on me.  Let's say I do find someone to hangout with, I'm super poor so we wouldn't even be able to do anything. Like ate cheese for lunch yesterday poor. Going to the movies or out to lunch is out of the question. Some big event like a concert or something? It would be next to impossible unless I planned and saved up all year for it. and I'm not going to invite someone to come over. I don't even have cable. What are they gonna do watch me sit on the computer? What if they get hungry? All I have to offer is water. No thanks.  Instead of finding someone who will take enough pity on me to babysit me I'll just pass. I don't want to be some charity case while someone tries to cheer me up. I would much rather just be left alone, at least then I can have some peace of mind.
ebbandflow96	The idea that relationships are only based on looks is ridiculous. Ugly people have relationships all the time. The views on this sub are views that keep that person exactly where they are. If they tell themselves they're too short to be loved and they can't change that then they'll be able to stop trying without having to accept the fact that they stopped trying because the emotional pain of going through rejections in order to find a girlfriend is too much for them to handle.  
ebbandflow96	I think it will work out in the future for you because it has or others. The average entrepreneur will have 3 failed business's before having a successful one. THE AVERAGE PERSON FAILS. Some people might get it in there first try, some people it might take 10 tries. The average is 3. If everyone used your logic and thought they are either successful or not then we would have a lot less stores.   It sounds like you had a pretty rough upbringing. In school I wouldn't get invited to anything either, sometimes I would catch word of it and go anyways and get kicked out. I know how shitty it is to get publicly mocked for being socially awkward as well. Does that mean I'll never go outside again? Fuck no.   Making friends gets a lot harder as life goes on but that doesn't mean it is impossible. Your username is a star wars reference, you know how many people are online right now who are more then willing to talk about that with you? Star wars subreddit has over 3k people online right now. Sure that isn't a buddy you can hangout with in person, which is a lot better and probably what you want, but at least its something. There are star wars conventions all the time. You can go and meet a ton of people who share an interest with you and possibly make some friends but even if you don't it will be practice with socializing that will help you make friends next time.   I completely understand not wanting to work a shitty job. Good job for wanting to improve yourself with studying. I'm sure that was a hard decision to make. You failed and probably felt like shit after, felt like you are incapable of doing it. But you can try again. Maybe get a tutor next time, maybe on the first day of class ask if anyone is interested in forming a study group. College will be a challenge for most people, my mother just started going to community college last year after finally getting her GED after being out of high school for over 15 years and every night while doing homework she complains about how impossible it all seems, but she will work through it, and so can you.   I' not trying to accuse you of not trying I'm accusing you of giving up. Don't. 
ebbandflow96	I think convincing people who could get better to stay miserable is worse then spreading false hope. I would rather trick a sad person into being happy then trick a happy person into staying sad.
ebbandflow96	You height does not correlate how successful you will be. Don't look at yourself and look for a reason why you will never succeed. All that does is rationalize why you should give up.   Instead focus on things you can improve. Focus on being a good person.   Edit: as a side note my father hit his last growth spurt at the age of 22, from what I've been told he did hit puberty late though. If you are honestly that worried about if you will grow or not you can go get an x-ray and see if your growth plates are still open or not. If you do that though, no matter the outcome, life doesn't have to suck. Just because you don't want it to be doesn't mean it won't be but if you never try it always will be. 
ebbandflow96	AUTOMODERATOR IS DESIGNED TO REINFORCE NEGATIVE VIEWS OF THE WORLD. It literally just said it is too old, too short, and not white enough to be happy. NONE OF THOSE THINGS DETERMINE HAPPINESS!!!!
ebbandflow96	Some girls? Sure. All girls? Definitely not. There are a ton of girls who think Brad Pitt is unattractive. Do you think because every girl doesn't think he is attractive he should stop trying to find girls that do? You might be an unattractive dude, you might not get to marry a super model, but the idea that no girl will ever find you attractive is just stupid.   Really want to put it to the test? Make a tinder, don't talk to anyone, and just swipe people. I guarantee you you will get at least one match from a real person who thinks you are hot.   That isn't even the biggest issue though. The issue here is how you view relationships. If it is going to be a hookup or fwb situation, sure, that is all based on fucking someone you find attractive, but an actual relationship is more based on personality and enjoying each others company. Focus on meeting a girl who you can be friends with and who you will really like, not some girl who will see you and want to hop on your dick.  
ebbandflow96	So you are misunderstanding some things. Some guys will be naturally more attractive and naturally attract more girls. That doesn't mean their relationships work out well. Everyone here talks about how much they hate "chads" but then they idolize them and want to be like them.   If you think only guys who attract girls off of raw sex appeal alone can get girlfriends you are sadly mistaken. You yourself might not be able to do that, that sucks man I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean a girl can't like you for a different reason like let's say similar interests or maybe your sense of humor. 
ebbandflow96	The post above yours is deleted so I can only see what you said but the only stupid thing about trying again is if you try and do the same thing and expect different results. If you weren't happy then try a different approach don't just accept everything is impossible for you to achieve. I'm sure you've talked yourself really deep into this mindset but I hope you can see the difference between self imposed limitations and things you are actually incapable of doing. 
ebbandflow96	When you say that it will put you as an equal what do you mean by that? Do you mean you will never be able to be as happy as them? I think everyone knows the cliche "peaked in highschool" type of kids. Just because they had sex as a kid doesn't mean they will have a good life after.   The only thing leftover from your 8 years of failure is your own negative opinion of yourself. If two guys are walking down the street it is impossible to tell which one had sex at a younger age. One guy might act more confident, but for all you know he is acting confident because he just beat a level in dark souls hes been having trouble with and now he feels like the shit because of it.  You are right that is some twisted and evil shit you did. Does that mean you can never redeem yourself? Nope. If people were unable to change then after every crime there would be a death sentence and therapy wouldn't exist. People do change.   You are currently damaged, that does not mean you can't get help and fix yourself.   You are getting "revenge on woman" but you do realize that it wasn't woman who made you like this right? It was your own self hatred becuase you couldn't do a thing that you tied so much importance to. Some people purposly choose to keep their virginity until they are married. Are any of thoose people forever fucked in the head? Absolutley not. The only difference is you took your virginity and turned it into something that tortured you day in and day out while they took pride in the fact. Same exact thing happened to you both, you didn't get laid, drastic different outcomes.  It can be repaired but if you constantly tell yourself it can't then it probably won't. 
ebbandflow96	You can get a job and earn money to continue playing. If every person to get a girlfriend was over an 8 there would only be people with god tier genes left.   Some girls might only date super model guys. All girls? Definitely not. Thinking that way will only ruin your chances with girls who might be interested in you.
ebbandflow96	I already have Astolfo as my desktop background, would making my phone background Astolfo as well be overkill? Probably, but I'm doing it anyways.
ebbandflow96	AUTOMODERATOR IS DESIGNED TO REINFORCE NEGATIVE VIEWS OF THE WORLD. 
ebbandflow96	Therapy exists. If you are having self-esteem issues because you weren't able to live up to a certain standard when you were younger you can work through that. Constantly beating yourself up over things you couldn't do in the past, and have done now, is just pointless and if you would really think about, it doesn't even make sense to do so.   You possibly felt angry and possibly hated yourself because of this. You possibly viewed yourself as less then the average person because of this. You told yourself you couldn't possibly be as good as others because you never did that one thing.  Well guess what? You did do that one thing you worried so much about. So obviously all of your worries weren't true. You viewed yourself as less but then proved to yourself that you aren't. Some of those opinions of inadequacy might still be left over but you are able to get over that, just like you got over being a virgin. 
ebbandflow96	Plenty of people lose their virginity after that. Telling yourself that is just a way to give yourself an excuse as to why you never will so you don't feel bad about giving up. 
ebbandflow96	That is defeatism. If you never buy a lottery ticket you can't get mad if you never win the power ball. You might not win on every ticket, but as soon as you stop buying tickets you lose your chance to win.   If you still want to be happy, you have to try. 
ebbandflow96	You need to realize relationships aren't solely based on attraction. The main focus is compatible personalities. Instead of trying to make your body instantly make girls wanna drool on you, you should focus on being a good person. If you go into a relationship with the mindset of "the only thing that matters is that she is hot" then there is no point in actually having a relationship with that person. All you want to do is fuck her.   Would you want a girl to only want you because you are attractive or would you want her to genuinely like you and share your interests? Stop pointing at your body and saying "That's the part she doesn't like!" and start reassessing what a healthy relationship is.
ebbandflow96	I know plenty of short guys in relationships. I had a friend in high school named Adam who was 5'2 and always had a girlfriend. Some girls will care about height and it will be a deal breaker but that doesn't mean all girls will.   Think of it like this: you yourself probably have a preferred type, whether it be you wouldn't date someone with tattoos or maybe you wouldn't date someone who was really religious. That doesn't mean there aren't guys out there who would want to date girls with tattoos or who are religious. That's alomst kind of obvious right? Different guys like different things, so is it so hard to believe there is a girl out there who doesn't have hangups on guys shorter then her?  Also, even if it mattered, 5'3 isn't even that short. At that height there are still plenty of girls who are shorter then you.   Don't make excuses for why you can't succeed. That is defeatism. Instead think of ways you can improve yourself.
ebbandflow96	that is a self imposed limitation
ebbandflow96	The idea that you can only be successful if you have a certain body image is wrong. Skinny guys have girlfriends all the time, as well as a ton of single body builders. 
ebbandflow96	You are aware that the only reason nobody could currently love you is your toxic attitude right? It is so obvious that you are trying to put the blame on absolutely anything else when the problem is obviously your personality. Don't try and give me the "omg I'm not a super model that's why nobody likes me" because ugly guys have amazing families all the time. Girls don't like who you are, your personality, work on that, be a decent human and people will treat you like one. Gay people aren't convincing straight girls not to have sex with you. They don't want to have sex with you because of how you think and probably act. Woman aren't subhuman because they won't appease you and just give you what you want. Why would any person give themselves to another person and not expect something back in return? If all you want to do is use a girl to masturbate with it's pretty obvious why she will never want to talk to you.   If I were to tell you I think you're a worthless piece of shit and that I'm better then you then tell you to go to the grocery store and buy me some food would you do it? Probably not because why would you do anything for someone who treats you that way. So, with that in mind, how can you possibly have a flair that reads "women are subhuman" then expect for any girl to give you the time of day?  If you are incapable of seeing this and changing your personality into something much healthier that's fine, it is your choice if you want to stay miserable like this forever; however, you shouldn't blame others for you not getting what you want, that's just childish, and you shouldn't try to discourage others who actually want to improve themselves.   Hopefully I helped you in someway.
ebbandflow96	females > males though right?
ebbandflow96	Work horses, reserved, conservative. That is the general stereotype for all Asians though. I've never heard of anyone clarifying between a Southeast or Western Asian before. They are all just Asian people.
ebbandflow96	Stuck between silver 3-1, really want to hit gold before the end of the season. Can anyone give me any tips? | https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=a%20little%20shadow  That is my op.gg. As you can see I main Kennen and Ahri. I was a Kennen one trick for mid and top(mid main) but after his nerfs awhile ago that changed his ult and took away a lot of his burst I only feel comfortable playing him top. In general I feel I am a lot worse at top and dislike how it can be such an island because as soon as I start doing bad in lane I feel like all I can do is sit there and slowly bleed out as the other top lane slowly snowballs. So deciding to have Kennen be my off role main and to focus on mid I picked up a handful of mid laners(Akali, Fizz, Syndra, Veigar, Ahri) and eventually whittled it down to one tricking Ahri in the mid lane.   When I am in the low silvers I will have a solid win rate, I'll climb up to silver 2ish and then go on huge lose streaks all the way back down. Currently I'm Silver 1 6lp and I'm afraid of it happening again so I'm here trying to fix my problems before that.  I have most of my problems with people who can poke me without me being able to retaliate like Lux, Xerath or Vel'koz and strong all in champs like Fizz, Diana or Zed. With poke champs if I'm able to get a snowball going early I do fine but if not I get completely run over.   For example my most recent ranked game into vel'koz I was doing good early. Level 3 I thought I caught him and all ined him with ignite. He lived with barely any health. I was at about half health and the wave allowed him to safetly sit under tower. when the wave finally pushes my jungler does a really awkward flash gank while vel is still under tower and im near my tower farming. Rammus almost dies. Me and vel stay in lane and I force a flash out of vel.  Right after kha'zix ganks and I die. Vel pushed the wave after and hit level 6 and backed. I get amp tome and boots I believe and idr what he buys. Before I hit level 6 kha ganks again and vel ults me and i die.  Then vel and kha invade my jungler red buff together as it is coming back up and kill him. Vel then comes back to lane tries to shove and does a lazy back and I am able to kill him. As soon as we both get back to lane though he lands a knock up on me and almost kills me, forcing me to back while barely being able to farm at all. Jayce then roams from top and they start taking my tower, I try to save it and end up dying again. At this point Vel is so much farther ahead of me he just snowballs uncontrollably while my team flames me to hell and back. He does so much more damage then me at this point he can sit back and just try and poke me and even if I all in him he just ults me and wins the trade anyway. With any other type of laner this is when I would try to shove and gank side lanes but vel can shove just as fast me and if i walk up to the wave to try and hit a q on all the minions I get chuncked. So I'm forced to be basically useless and try to just get any farm I can. Mid game he does so much more damage then me and I'm so under powered I am basically just a stun bot and end the game 6-12-12.   That is basically the story of what happens whenever someone who can outrange me gets ahead. They can just wail on me and I just have to try and endure. This gives them the priority for roaming and then they influence the map while I try and react to them.  So in those situations and in general from what you can see on my op.gg what can I do to be able to get better?
ebbandflow96	I would really love if the Mixtapes got back together. Modern Baseball too.
ebbandflow96	Cirque du freak! Also Eragon.
pixidust70	I'm the stupidest and weakest person alive. I just want to end it all. | I am finally living with the man I love. We got along great until a few weeks ago. Long story short, he has a woman "best friend" who he chats with frequently. He knows my feelings towards that friendship, as she was the reason he moved away a couple years ago.  He won't tell me anything about their friendship, just that she's a really good friend. They had a fight around the time he moved in with me, and he didn't speak with her for 7 months. Now they're speaking again, and he never tells me what they chat about. He won't even tell me what the fight was about, other than it was a misunderstanding. We are going on a trip next week, and I have paid for about 90% of it, because I love him, and want him to experience some fun. He has depression and anxiety as well. He is not himself since he started on a new med, he doesn't even cuddle me anymore. Today, we were grocery shopping, and whenever he texts this woman, he never says anything. He had a huge smile on his face, which I haven't seen in a long time. I asked if it was because he was excited about the trip, and he said he hasn't really been thinking about it. I want to fucking kill myself so bad right now. This is the same pain I felt when he moved away. I do not want to go through this again. I can't go through this again!!! 
pixidust70	I'm just sick of him not telling me the truth. I'm in so much pain emotionally right now. I don't want to lose him. We had such a great relationship, until she came back into the picture. I'm sick of being lied to. But I know if I push too hard, he will leave me. 
pixidust70	I'm done
pixidust70	I did therapy, tried meditation and mindfulness. Both cause me more anxiety, especially mindfulness. I'm working against my better judgement, because I wanted to move away from my mother. She brings me down even more. My dad passed away last week, and she's even worse now. I can't handle it. I've told her to find a therapist or something, but to not talk to me about it, because I have enough issues. She won't stop. I want to explode. And when she's done talking, my brain races. Nothing stops it. I need peace.  I was going to do it this weekend, but promised a friend I would wait. I'm sick of being hurt, and not being able to trust people, or even my own judgement when it comes to people. So just going through the motions now.
pixidust70	Keep slipping back into the black hole. | I'm back to wanting to end it all again. I am sick of feeling depressed, disappointed, anxious, and I just want it all to stop. I can't do this anymore. I feel like crying all the time now. What's the point to this? I finally got a job I dreamed of, but keep screwing up, and feel like I am too stupid to do it, and too slow to keep up the demand of the job. I need to just quit, but then I would screw things up for them, but then again, I suck anyway. Anyway, I don't even know why I'm writing this here, except that I can't talk to anyone, and the people I can normally talk to, are too busy. I have what I need to do it, I am probably going to be gone by the weekend. Peace out!
pixidust70	Been hurt too many times to count. | It seems that no matter what I do, or what I say, in the end, I will always end up getting hurt. I can be the nicest person, and still get shit on. The pain is too much, and I am just too tired to do it anymore. I have a couple things to do, and then I'm going to finally have peace.  This is a great site. I've met a lot of cool people. I guess my time is done on here. I hope everyone finds the peace they deserve.  I'll be back on here one more time. Take care everyone. 
pixidust70	Have you considered looking into a career? Try going to school?
pixidust70	I know how it feels after losing a job, it sucks, and it makes the depression so much worse. As the other poster suggested, talk to your husband, his job is to be there to support you, whatever you need. The other thing is, be patient with yourself, it sounds like your husband is being patient, which is great. Give yourself some time to move forward, before looking for a job. It's difficult, no matter the circumstances. But it's even more difficult when dealing with depression.  Every day give yourself a goal, it doesn't have to be big. It could be anything. Say cleaning the litter box. Once that goal is set, and you do it, you will feel a bit better. If you can't think of one every day, then maybe every other day. Something you know you can do. It will help you feel a bit better. And once you're feeling stronger, maybe a goal will be to apply for one job a day. But keep it simple, until you're stronger. Take care.
pixidust70	Have you tried talking to your doctor about it, or a professional? Sometimes it helps to have a professional help you sort through your thoughts and see where this is coming from. As for not knowing what you want to do, you should try and see a career counsellor. They can help you sort through different career paths that suit you, and that would give you a focus. Good luck.
pixidust70	Never knew there was a nausea side effect to Wellbutrin, I was on it, never had that issue. But it affects people differently. Not sure what that med would be you got, but hopefully it helps. I'm glad you got to the doctor.
pixidust70	You are not poison, and have not had bad luck. You have been through so much, so I understand why you think that. Going through what you have, and still here breathing, makes you stronger than you think. I'm not sure what country you're in, but some will let you take sick leave for mental health. You will be able to have some time off to concentrate on yourself. Your health comes above anything else. If you can't do that, or don't want to do that, then do one thing, just for yourself, every day. Take a bubble bath, watch a movie, take yourself out for dinner. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something you enjoy.  It sounds like you have a very important job, but like I said, you're more important. I am really sorry for all you've gone through, you didn't deserve any of it. But you have done really well with your career, it sounds like, and have two kids, that I know you cherish.  Take care, and I wish you well.
pixidust70	Have you ever gone to counselling for your abuse? If not, that's a start. Try to find victim's services or something of that nature. They can connect you with counselling. You shouldn't have to deal with this alone. As for your children. You are their whole world. Your five year old will be so confused and lost, and will wonder where mommy went. Your fourteen year old, being a teenager, is trying to find his place in this world, he's still developing. He loves you, but he is fourteen, and teenagers can act as if they don't care, but they do. He would be devastated. Kids can be resilient, but they shouldn't have to be. Please, for your sake, and your kids' sake, seek some professional help. You can feel better with the right care. 
pixidust70	That's awesome.Hope it works out. 
pixidust70	Totally agree.
pixidust70	You are right. The down votes should be trashed. Too many trolls out there. 
pixidust70	You are great friend. It doesn't hurt to stop by to check up on her, and the gofundme page is an excellent idea. How do you think she would react to something like that? Maybe call her before going over, just to make sure it's ok. Don't have to tell her why, maybe just tell her you just want to hang out for a bit. Friends like you are awesome. You have a good heart. I hope your friend gets the help she needs.
pixidust70	You should apply. You never know. 
pixidust70	I used to do that. It was kind of distresser for me. Anything that was bothering me didn't when I did that. Why do you want to kill yourself?
pixidust70	Having a job will help with your thoughts, will give you a focus.
pixidust70	Have you applied anywhere?
pixidust70	That's cool. Do you like anything else? Do you work?
pixidust70	There is help out there. Do you think if you got help, you would never be allowed back out there? I'm sure it would be temporary. It will take some time, but you could be back doing what you love, once you're stable. You are important, you come first. You need help, and I know it's difficult to ask for it, especially with your fears. I'm sure there are plenty of other officers out there who are on antidepressants, doing their job just as well. There are millions of people living their normal lives on them. Give yourself that chance. Take care.
pixidust70	You have lots of support here. You aren't alone. The loneliness only makes those thoughts louder. I know exactly how you feel. What kind of things do you like to do? What makes you happy?
pixidust70	Hope your mom can take you. I'm not sure how your guardian became a guardian at all. Talk about really failing you.
pixidust70	Is there any other way of getting there? Another worker even? I wish I lived closer, I would take you. Wish there was more I could do. I'm so sorry. What about your guardian or mom?
pixidust70	Could depend on what country you live in. They all have different ways of doing things.
pixidust70	Thank you. I can't even get excited about the job, but once it gets closer, I know my anxiety will go through the roof. But I am hoping I can learn fast, and will like it. I have so many fears about it.
pixidust70	Is there a way to get to a walk in clinic? You could talk to a doctor there. They may help you.
pixidust70	Getting fed up | I want to end it, but I don't. I am sick of feeling the way I do. I want to be happy, I want to have that special someone. But it feels like it's drifting farther away. I feel like everything I have gone through, and have worked for was for nothing. I know the man I love is doing things, that he knows would hurt me, and stringing me along at the same time. But I'm too stupid and weak to tell him. I met with him yesterday, and he said he wants to move in with me, BUT it may be a year from now, he doesn't know. I should be at least happy he wants to, but I know he's with other women, and it's ok, because we aren't a couple, he can do what he wants, but it hurts that he won't be honest with me. I could tell him I know, but he will deny it. He always wants to protect me. I just hope he didn't say he wants to move in with me to make me happy, and then when he thinks I'm stable, tell me he's changed his mind. I hate him, but I love him. I am the stupidest person on the planet. I'm also the biggest chicken. I am afraid to tell him off, just in case he really does mean what he says. I just needed to get it out. I am starting a new job in just over a week, and he's all excited about it. I should be too, it's been a long haul. But, I have this fear I will have a breakdown, and it won't last. If that happens, I will most definitely end it, I will have no choice, because then I will lose everything.
pixidust70	Have you ever tried meditation? Or anything of that nature? A lot of people swear by it. Just a suggestion.
pixidust70	Sorry I haven't messaged you, been going through some stuff. I don't know what to tell you. Except keep pushing your social worker. Tell him he needs to find you a safe place, that's his job. If he can't find something, maybe he needs to talk to his superior and get some advice. I know it isn't easy there, but it isn't easy anywhere, but there has to be a better place for you to be.
pixidust70	Don't stoop to other people's level. You have integrity, that's honourable. You have a family, so many people have never had the experience of being a parent. I know how hard it is when looking at finances. Being let go the way you were, I know exactly what it's like. My ex employer lied about why I was being let go (three different lies). I have been struggling ever since. I finally went back to school, and just got a job, and now, hopefully, I'll be starting a new chapter. I'm terrified, because if this doesn't work out, I don't know what I will do. You have a family who would rather have you, than the money. You are their whole world. You can always get another job, go to school, and learn something new, there are things you can do, you just have to see what's out there. Don't give up without at least trying. Take care.
pixidust70	My apologies to the poster. This went totally off topic. I have deleted my responses. You deserve a loving, caring person. Simple as that, and there are plenty out there. Take care.
pixidust70	I don't know why she doesn't take a pay cut before hurting those who can't afford things like transportation.
pixidust70	I know, she has no clue about anything. That was one of the stupidest decisions ever. She loves to make the most vulnerable suffer. Seems to be her favourite pass time.
pixidust70	Not looking into that. But I know there are other options, just looking into it. Sometimes they make it hard to find, because our provincial government sucks. 
pixidust70	I'm glad your social worker is going to get you to your doctor, that's great. If you're concerned about whether or not Wellbutrin is Asperger's friendly, can always ask the pharmacist, they will know. I have been trying so hard to find something for you, but I have fallen short. I can find services in other countries, but not in my own province. Sad state of affairs. But I will keep looking when I am on my computer, you never know, something might come up. Take care.
pixidust70	Yeah, since the Liberals came into power, our health care has gone from number one in Canada to almost last. They are more for big business. Christy Clark always said families first. Yeah her's and her friend's families, the rest of us can drown, which she is doing a great job at doing.
pixidust70	Ok. I'm a fellow BC person, don't have the same issues, but I know how hard it's been for you. I know my way around the area, I was born and raised in Abbotsford. I am still looking into it.  
pixidust70	No she may not, it takes some digging, but I'm sure she can stay in province, but might have to move further than she thinks. Like Prince George, she should know where that is. There are a lot of small towns around there, that are still reasonable for rent.
pixidust70	I'm trying to figure out where it would be feasible for you to move to get out of there. It will take a bit, but there are places, just have to dig.
pixidust70	Ok here's a link that you should look into..http://www.supportworkercentral.com/ also look into WorkBC, they're awesome to help you find work, and give you so much support, I'm using them right now for a new job. If you want specifics, let me know. They will even pay for your schooling, or anything to like that. 
pixidust70	Not other province, but other city in the province. Just to clarify 
pixidust70	First off, I'm sorry for what you're going through. Second off, ask your doctor about Wellbutrin for you depression, it's supposed to be really good. I am looking into what I can do to get you some support, and get yourself out of there. I know very well how hard it is to find affordable housing, I live in the same province, but the city is exactly how it is in Vancouver. Even the Fraser Valley is having the same issues. Give me a bit, and will see what I can figure out. There are ways to get help, just have to know how. And if you do have to move, you don't have to worry about finding another social worker, your file will be transferred, and you will automatically get a new one in your new town, that's if you decide to move.
pixidust70	Try this site. Looks like it's not much different than here at all. Hope this can help you....http://www.woodshomes.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=woods_homes_homepage
pixidust70	Try to tell your doctor all of your concerns. If it would be easier, write everything down and give it to your doctor, then you can go over it point by point. Some doctors will try to get you in sooner to see someone, if possible. I'm in Canada so I know all about wait lists. It is just as bad here. I was told it would take months to get to see another psychiatrist, so decided on seeing a counsellor instead. She helps, it's nice to have someone to talk to. I will see if I can find anything to help you get in sooner. Take care.
pixidust70	I'm sorry, I can hear the pain as I read this. At 16, you're still developing, you're still growing, so you are not a lost cause. Good for you for seeking help, this puts you on the right path. May I ask what country you are in? Some countries you can get in sooner, with the right resources, and I will do my best to help you.
pixidust70	You made a good decision by coming here looking for help. That's a start. Everyone has something they're good at, you just haven't realized it yet. Do you drive? Do you cook? You can obviously write, you're very articulate. Don't sell yourself short. Maybe go see a career counsellor, and get tested to see what you might be good at. You never know what secret talent you have.
pixidust70	Why can't you tell your parents?
pixidust70	Most likely not. I would never wish this on anyone, even my worst enemy. 
pixidust70	I asked my cousin, her girlfriend is a cop in Edmonton, need an address for her.
pixidust70	I'm working on something, give me a minute
pixidust70	Tell her to call 911
pixidust70	Ok, she needs to call the police and tell them everything. They will take her and her kids to a safe place. 
pixidust70	http://www.johnhoward.org/programs-and-services/family-violence-prevention  tell her to go here, they will help her.
pixidust70	What State. There are resources out there, let me help you find them. I help someone out not too long ago with it.
pixidust70	Ok. Give me a minute. Do you know her name? You can pm me if you want. 
pixidust70	Or what city?
pixidust70	I'm in Canada. Do you know what province?
pixidust70	They don't understand depression at all. That isn't understanding, because those are what people who don't understand think. What country do you live in?
pixidust70	Do you know where she lives?
pixidust70	You're 21, an adult, you can go to a psychiatrist without their consent. Maybe talk to your doctor, he/she may be able to get you on a medication that would help. Your parents could also be scared, because they don't understand depression, not making excuses, but there are still too many people out there who don't understand.
pixidust70	I'm not treating you like a burden, or telling you to kill yourself. I never would. You are not a burden, you have rights like everyone else. And anyone who says things like that are not worth knowing. I'm sorry you've been treated so horrendously, no one deserves that. I'm here if you let me be. 
pixidust70	I'm sure not everything is your fault. People like to lay blame on others to make themselves feel superior. I get blamed a lot for stuff too, I know that feeling. 
pixidust70	I will listen, please just talk it out. Not like it will hurt anything will it? 
pixidust70	Thank you.
pixidust70	Doesn't hurt to let your doctor know before the ten days are up. It's a good idea to let him know asap, so you will be, the very least, monitored a little closer.
pixidust70	Don't do what I am planning | I have been living in a torturous mind for years. The last couple years have been even worse for me. I am trapped in this mind, with no way out. I don't handle medications well, actually make me feel worse, and everything else I have tried, hasn't worked. My whole body is shaking, my mind is heavy, and I am just tired. I need it all to stop. I have a few things to do, and then I will be gone. Thank you, everyone, for your support, but this is really the end. I still have a few days before this will happen, because I do believe things can change, but I'm not sure it's going to be enough. The pain is unbearable, and I just don't want to keep fighting anymore.  If I was younger, I could see a reason to keep going, but not now. Take care.
pixidust70	I can understand that. Do you have any family around that could be with you?
pixidust70	Why can't you go to the hospital until Monday?
pixidust70	Thank you for all the information. I will consider it, but like my friend said, because of the schedule of medication for a separate issue, and the fact it will just add to my stress on figuring out when to take anything else, I just can't do it anymore. I usually forget, or just can't be bothered with it because, for me, it's just not viable. Can't really explain more than that. Sorry, I'm tired, so this probably doesn't make much sense.
pixidust70	She will be ok, she has new meds and a relationship. There are plenty of people on here she can reach out to. She's been a great friend and if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here now. We do have a unique friendship, and even though I know it will end with me, I don't have any other choice.
pixidust70	I've tried a lot of supplements, and I can't afford to get allergy testing. I would love to see a naturopath, but can't afford that at all. Maybe if I could afford to see one, things might be different. Doctors just keep throwing meds at me, and every time I tell them they aren't working, they increase it, only to make me feel worse. I finally am done with all meds, and I just don't want to feel these feelings anymore. I am so tired, and just don't have it in me.
pixidust70	Hi. Yes it is quite possible that the increase in the medication is causing it. I have had the same issue when I had an increase in medication as well. Your best bet is to call your doctor and let them know what's happening, so they can help you. Take care. 
pixidust70	I'm 46, I've been fighting this since I was 13. It got worse the last couple of years, and I'm exhausted. I don't have much left to fight with. I don't want to feel this for another year, I can't feel this for another year. I am physically and mentally exhausted. I just want to be done.
pixidust70	My sister has seen a naturopath, and had improved a great deal because of it. Her thyroid was so out of control, her doctor kept increasing her medication, and she could not lose weight. Then when she saw the naturopath, she was given new supplements, and the weight fell off, and she's healthier than she has been in years. Her mental health has vastly improved with it. They aren't all whack. 
pixidust70	I've been diagnosed with depression, general and social anxiety, and adjustment disorder. I'm sure there's some PTSD and ADD in there somewhere too, but not enough for them to diagnose it.
pixidust70	What's going on? At least talk it out.
pixidust70	I know the exact feeling. It's torture. Have you seen anyone about this? Are you on any medication? I know it doesn't feel like it, but you can get through this. I'm here if you need to talk.
pixidust70	Potential is a one way street. It's up to you to decide what you're going to do. At 16, you have so much potential. You have support here, and a lot of people understand how you feel. That sense that it is going nowhere is understandable. At 16 you feel like everything is so far away, and out of reach, but it isn't. You have so many opportunities out there, you just have to look. You definitely have more than I did at 16. Please, talk to your therapist, you need to be 100% open with them to help you. What you think, isn't necessarily what is.
pixidust70	Sorry, tried to separate them, but click on the different lines. I really hope this helps.
pixidust70	I believe you, and I am so sorry you're going through this. Even though it's been a couple of years, you can still press charges against him, and you should. If your mom won't help you, then find someone you trust to help you, and have them be your advocate. Try to sit down and tell your mom what happened, I'm sure she loves you, and will listen. I'm sure if she knew, she would never see him again, and would have your back. Just give her a chance to be there for you. Also, get hold of victim's services, or something like that, and talk to someone there, they may give you some ideas on how to go about pressing charges. Take care. I'm here if you want to talk. 
pixidust70	That's great that you've been getting help. If you don't think the therapy is working, it doesn't hurt to request an antidepressant. Sometimes both together works better than just one. Just don't give up, you're on the right track.
pixidust70	It's late here, I'm in Canada, but will be on tomorrow. Take care, and if you message me, I promise I will reply when I wake up in the morning.
pixidust70	Here's websites you might find helpful.http://justspeak.org.nz/resources/here-to-help/personal-and-victim-help/ http://www.victimsupport.org.nz/get-help/support-after-sexual-violence-or-family-violence/  http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/victims/victims-rape-or-sexual-assault I hope this helps you.
pixidust70	Ok. Just so you know, it will take weeks the way you want to do it, not days. So be prepared to wait a long time.
pixidust70	Call victim's services. They will help you. Can I ask you what country you live in?
pixidust70	At 16, you have a lot to improve. You haven't even graduated, gone to college, you haven't given yourself a chance to see what you're capable of. You sound like me at 16, and with the right support ,you can move mountains.
pixidust70	You sound exactly like me. I didn't even have a real career until this year. Up until now I only worked are deadend jobs, still live with my mom, and don't have a significant other, yes I'm a loser, but trying to keep going. My last date I set was for last month, if I had done it, I would have never got this job.
pixidust70	I know it's hard to keep the motivation, I'm 46 and have given up so many times, only to come back and try again. I know how much it sucks, I've been so close to giving up, I technically shouldn't even be here now, never thought things would get better, but slowly they are.
pixidust70	They won't work over night, they take time, just like anything. Meditation takes a long time to master, healthy eating isn't just a short term thing, it's long term, it won't make you feel better right away, but all of it together can help, just have to stick with it.
pixidust70	The one person who will never get over it, even though you may not think so, is your mom. My brother died 29 years ago, and she still cries on his birthday, the anniversary of his death, and holidays. She has faced a lot of loss in her life, but that was the hardest.  I hate therapists and doctors as well, so trying things on my own. I have a friend who is kind of like a guru who is trying to help me. I'm stubborn, so some stuff I laugh at, but some of it rings true. Maybe try looking into mindfulness or meditation. Don't give up before at least trying everything out there. 
pixidust70	That's great news. Just keep doing what you can. Definitely keep talking here, that's what it's here for. I'm sure Julia would be very proud of you. :)
pixidust70	I was also bullied, and I agree, people do suck. But there are also good people out there. I'm sorry for the pain that people have caused you, especially your family. My family is the same way, I can't stand them half the time. But I still fight. I just got a job 40 minutes away because I want so badly to get out of here and away from everyone. If you want to talk, I'll listen, this site has helped me out a lot, and is full of awesome people, just give it a chance. Take care.
pixidust70	It will be more than one year of grief you will cause, it will be a lifetime of grief. But more important, why would you want to do this? Has something happened? I know how it feels to want to die, I get the thoughts very strongly, and have even set dates, but keep fighting. Please try and get some help, there is help out there, you just need to ask. Take care.
pixidust70	Also, maybe, when you're ready, look into going to a grief support group, or some kind of grief counselling, that may help you too. 
pixidust70	I'm so sorry for your loss. I know the pain is unbearable, and understand your thinking. Give yourself time to process everything, and give yourself time to heal. I'm glad you're not alone in this, you have people to lean on. You talking about it ,will help you through it too.  Be kind to yourself, and be patient with yourself. Yes your life has changed, but you will learn to move on. You will always love and miss her. But you will feel happiness again. Grieving is a process, and everyone grieves differently, so like I said , just be kind to yourself, and let yourself grieve. You will know when you're ready to start putting the pieces back together. Take care.
pixidust70	Do you have the means to move to a bigger town?
pixidust70	Why would you want to kill yourself? Plus, no guarantee you will die, not everyone dies. You may permanently make yourself handicapped instead.
pixidust70	You're more than welcome :) Hope it helps.

Future-officer	For this case though?!   It's not like she's asking money for a shitty YouTube series, she's got *real* issues that may screw up her life.  
Future-officer	American health prices are fucking criminal.   You really need the money.   I'd start one if I was you. 
Future-officer	Hmm, fair point.  Most sane people, hopefully, realize that scammers make fake go-fund-me pages quit frequently and thus not wanna risk wasting money to a fake cause.  However for the people she does know it would be perfectly viable way to help her out. She could share it on Facebook so all of her close, distant, and acquaintances all know who she is and therefore have more confidence in themselves IF they wish to donate money.  
Future-officer	Twas a dream once when I first was introduced to reddit.   Now that's all its ever gonna be
Future-officer	Considering all of these articles I've seen in the past months, I've learned that mechanical failures are no freaking joke in the military.   Hope they come home safe. 
Future-officer	As generic as this sounds, push harder.   Here's the science. It takes a vigorous exercise to get the "feel-good" exercise chemicals to do there work in your fantastic complicated brain of yours.   Endorphines are released in your brain in order to:  1. nullify the pain of mico-tearing of your muscles  2. To make you feel *really* good while doing so  However, you have to get to a certain point of vigorous activity in order for endorphins and other chemicals to start up.   Don't be like those people who just sit on the stationary bicycle pedaling at a turtles pace while updating there Instagram page.  That does absolutely nothing.   Instead, push yourself till you start to feel "the burn!"  After a solid 30-50 minutes of feeling "the burn" you can stumble home, take a nice long sleep, and next day reap the rewards of increased dopamine and other "feel good" chemicals.

Future-officer	there we go brother  
Future-officer	I already do wayyyy too much.....  
Future-officer	just how it should be hah
Future-officer	stop   doing   drugs
Future-officer	I understand that.  I'm talking about pathways for becoming an officer by enlisting first.  Do you believe that enlisting with reserves, then doing to SMP to gain commission is a legit way to becoming an officer by first enlisting? 
Future-officer	I'm no scientist, but 99% sure you're gonna be just fine.   
Future-officer	What about SMP?
Future-officer	Okay, make sure to keep it that way. Military has zero tolerance for weed.   But, enough of that.   To answer your question, it depends. Have you been running and or doing physical exercise? If so how much? 
Future-officer	They said in the contract I signed that I had to.....  
Future-officer	I got one. I gave a local gym my marine DEP contract to which I was already discharged from. I enlisted into the USMC DEP and my boot camp date was set for October 24th. After taking a good hard look at marine jobs, none of them really interested me. So, instead I went to join the army reserve as a 68C and got my ship date for BCT in January. Well, unfortunately gym memberships are expensive as hell on a monthly basis, not only that this gym wanted me to pay a 150 BUCK cancellation fee. But, heres the catch. They only make people pay IF you don't have a legit excuse. So, I showed them my USMC DEP application and got it cancelled saved about 350 bucks in monthly charges and cancellation fees.

Future-officer	There is going to be a day when the last memory of your exististance is going to perish to the decay of time.   There will be a day will that one family members who's only heard of you as a great-great grandfather who lived during that funky 21st century. That one last person who has any memory of your existence will shrivel up and die.   You're existence in the grand scheme of things is nothing but a grain of sand resting in a desert.  With all this considered, why waste time feeling bad about yourself?  Right now you have the ability to live. LIVE.   babies are born with cancer before they even have the chance to go to grade school and even MAKE a friend. regardless wether he goes to the next school over or not.   good people get killed for unjust reasons. Genocides like the holocaust, Darfur, hotel Rwanda. But here you are still breathing  life is fragile  and here you are living in the best time to ever be alive in the history of man kind in no less one of the best countries. Getting your education, living a very healthy life while having the internet at the tips of your fingers.   If you look at it the right way..... why.....why arent you happy?  You have *so* *so* much
Future-officer	Yes, all the time.   Not so much SO, but more so with casual friends I make at school.   I get asked sometimes that "why don't you come and do <insert fun, adventurous thing>?"   I don't feel that I fit in   
Future-officer	Try embracing it instead of denying it, life is a lot easier when you "man up."
Future-officer	You think, therefore you are.   
Future-officer	you gon die
Future-officer	keep on keeping on
Future-officer	Basic training counts as one of those summer training schools. I forgot which one because I am not 100% clear on this subject myself.  I would speculate that the personal experience with going to BCT is going to give you intangible fortitude and military bearing.   You have a taste of the real army for a while. Those months you spend at BCT and AIT will be the first steps to getting used to the "Army way."  Sorry I can't really get too specific because I for one haven't even experienced this myself yet lol, I just linger the fuck out of r/ROTC and r/army for others who were SMP and just remember what they said about it.   I'm sure if you ask on r/ROTC you'll find a cadet or past cadet who has been through ROTC.   Hope this helps
Future-officer	Do you what you gotta do my man.   hmu if you have anymore questions. 
Future-officer	Just like Bilboa69 said.   I spoke with an ROTC recruiter and he told me the same thing. It's called a "lateral entry."   You'll have no *pressing* issues with entering ROTC as a junior, however you will have a bit of a difficult time adjusting to the lifestyle.   There are going to be cadets there who were in since they were MS1's and MS2's and they will have much more ROTC experience than you. Considering this, entering as a lateral entry, you'll have to play catch-up. You will be expected to perform to the standards which they set for you. Not saying its impossible, I'm saying you'll have a tougher time meeting those standards since you are coming in late into ROTC.   My ROTC recruiter informed me that it is much more challenging coming in as a junior than it is as a freshman or sophomore. Which is why he recommended me to do the SMP program.   Currently, I'm a sophomore who is just about to graduate with a degree in liberal arts. I'm enlisting in the army reserve so I can become an SMP cadet. why do I do this?  1: that sweet TA. Sure it will not cover all of my tuition, however it will take a descent chunk out with the help of FAFSA.  2. Other scholarships like the minutemen, ROTC scholarships, etc.   3. Having the real army experience under your belt, something that many other cadets do not have.  4. A steady, part-time job which you'll do one weekend a month WITH the added benefit that you will be shadowing a leader (an officer ranging from O-1 to O-5) so you can learn in a hands on environment how to become a leader.   All in all, SMP is a great opportunity.      
Future-officer	https://www.reddit.com/r/ROTC/wiki/smp  Here's a good start.  
Future-officer	Hello,   I'm a native to Rochester and have been going to college there for 2-years now.   Good news for you, Rochester has very reasonable housing prices (relative to the cities). No clue about specific pricing, but I've heard nothing but good things about prices.   Beautiful scenery? Honestly its everywhere. there are plenty of houses which I've seen had very beautiful views.   Rochester has sizable heavily wooded hills surrounding it. There are plenty of houses which perch on tall hills overlooking sizable distances. If you have the money, you could find a really top notch home.   Seasons consist of this:  winter: cold as living hell. regularly gets below zero  spring: when its not raining (or when seasons having a identity crisis wether it should snow or rain) its amazing weather, probably the best during the year.   summer: hotter than living hell. Being land of 10,000 lakes our humidity is off the charts. Staying in the shade will not keep you cool.   fall: heat begins to dial down to great weather, but cold nights start creeping up.   then back to winter.  Rochester has you covered for food. Rochester has fancy, 5-star restaurants like Victorias, fast food, and a food court.   Roch has a lot of evergreens and huge maples.   You'll see scattered lakes surrounding the area.   Hope this helps  
Future-officer	I haven't made the transition from community college to a university/ROTC yet, however I will be in the next couple years or so.   I'm enlisting as a reservist and then attending ROTC at a local university to earn commission in the army medical corps.   * 1. tl:dr *It is a realistic goal (with my past shitty GPA) which will give me amazing opportunities for my life.*   As cheesy as it sounds, I feel that ROTC will give me the opportunity to challenge myself to do great things academically. For example, I was an incredible slacker 1-2 years ago who didn't give 2 shits about school. I had no ambition, nor did I have the confidence to do anything because I felt that my actions in school would not get me anywhere. So, since I believed school wasn't going to do anything for me I decided to slack off. My High School GPA was 2.2 and the first 2 semesters at my community college was 2.8  Then, while taking a college tour at a big state university with a buddy of mine we bumped into a ROTC recruiter and thats were it all began.   Its a program which *needs* bodies. The army is always looking for new recruits and they do not have the highest standards to commission there recruits. Heck, the minimum GPA to stay in ROTC is a 2.0!!!! It was a realistic goal which (with a lot of suffering and getting my ass kicked) will pay off for me for decades to become.   Becoming a 2nd LT in the army is a incredible springboard for not only if you want to stay in the army, but if you want to jump into the civilian side.   Now, the more motivated me just pulled a 3.6 and a 3.7 my last 2 semesters at community college because the army gave me a goal to strive towards.   * two. haven't attended ROTC yet, can't answer.  * three. ^  
Future-officer	whoops, my bad
Future-officer	HOG is great for playing a serious game  Free Candy Van is great if you want to play a semi-serious game with a hell of alot more tolerance for well-intentioned fucking around.  
Future-officer	TL;DR: Actually, on the contrary thats not really fishy at all. He wasn't really being unreasonable at all.   Being a MP doesn't take a high score at all. I know an old high school friend of mine who became an army MP constantly dropped C's and D's in his High School level math and English classes and he got a high enough score (barely) to get that job.  Considering you are taking calculus at a high school level, you should be able to blow the math portion out of the water.  source: I had a 2.15 GPA in high school, took the ASVAB one year out and got a 87.   
Future-officer	>I would be under no obligation to join the military if I attend boot camp   .....wut  Going to MEPS, taking your physical, and swearing in IS obligating yourself to the military.   You can't go to BCT unless you are contracted for a certain number of years.   I don't really know who to believe here because that is one hell of a lie. Like, almost an unbelievable one. Like wtf either your recruiter is terrible at lying/dickface or you are leaving somthing out. 
Future-officer	Never, I just want to see the world

Future-officer	About 2-years ago I took behavioral counciling sessions. I revealed to my therapist that I have smoked quite a bit of weed and had suicidal thoughts in high school. Also, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.   A lot of time has passed and I've made great progress in my life. I'm about to earn my 2-year liberal arts degree with a 3.2 GPA, I earned a student leadership position at my community college, and I have been in great overall mental/physical shape.   Am I automatically disqualified in joining the police force with my past depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts?
Future-officer	I understand what you are saying, but I don't have depression issues anymore.   It was a very small episode, about 6 months, which really doesn't affect me anymore.

Future-officer	Are degrees in history worth it? | Guys, I love history. It's been a passion of mine ever since I was 10. My dad got me a sweet WWII DVD box set with the Pacific, European, and African theaters of war. Ever since then, I've been compulsively watching YouTube vids and playing historical video games, and taking college classes.   It's the one subject I really look forward to.   However due to bad luck my family is poor as shit, therefore I am poor as shit. I have an opportunity to study history at the U of Minnesota which holds one of the best history programs in the Midwest.   It would be a blast earning a degree in the field, however if I choose to pursue this route, I more than likely will have to take large loans out to pay for college.   What are the chances of getting a descent enough job to pay off my loans after I complete my B.S.?   Edit: Thanks for the help guys, means a lot    
Future-officer	This is all amazing information.  However, here's the issue.   I'm already earning my A.A.S degree in the summer with 60 credit hours and about a 3.2 GPA.   Soooo, I'm not sure if I can get as much opportunity as I could have a couple years ago.
Future-officer	I should......

Future-officer	Hmm, how's the pay??  What kind of degree?
Future-officer	Considering pursuing a degree in HR, any tips? | Is this a good job to go into?  How is the pay if you just have a B.S. in HR?  Overall, are you guys satisfied?   
Future-officer	You mean I can be a 2nd lieutenant and go to grad school?? 
Future-officer	DOD medical board | I know a cadet must past DOD medical standards in order to be contracted into ROTC.   I have past therapy for depression/anxiety.  It's long gone now, and I'm fine now.   Do I even have a chance of being medically qualified to contract?
Future-officer	Hypothetically, during those duration of 7 years I would have earned my B.S., had about 2-3 years of ROTC exp., and some time in the workforce, and <insert random student government/ student life activities>   That should beefin' up my chances.....hypothetically. Fuck, idk this is pretty far off in the future. 
Future-officer	Fuck it, I'm joining ISIS  
Future-officer	It's going to be awhile before I can join the right way. In about 4-5 years I can join no sweat.( they don't care about anything medically related if it was 7-years ago or more.)   Back up plan? I'm pretty freaking lost. Maybe I can just do ROTC as a non-contract, get my B.S., work in the civilian market, and try out for OCS??   Are 25ish year old 2nd Lt's a thing?? 
Future-officer	I'm majoring in Human Resources, I hope that can beef-up my chances.
Future-officer	Fucking shit   Edit: That's basically my situation.....every recruiter I've talked with says the only way I'm getting in, is if I lie.   
Future-officer	No not yet, I'm still figuring out a game plan.   Haven't even touched the MEPS physical yet, nor do I really want to quite yet.   Getting a medical waiver for my past mental health issues aren't very likely and my recruiter(s) heavily-suggested to me that there's little chance I'm going to be granted one. 
DoritoFan55	Help with feelings | So, recently, I've been participating on reddit, and I posted a bit here. But, also, I've been looking at things that I've done before in the past years, and things that I've left. I feel like my regrets and losses are just sitting there.. Any help? I don't know if this is strictly depression, but it really sucks. Just knowing what you missed out on, and friends that you've left.. It's kind of left me feeling weird.

DoritoFan55	Hey, I hope therapy helps you! I've had friends with depression before, and can't even begin to imagine how bad it is. But that's why you have to pull through! I promise, once you get through therapy, it'll be better than ever before. If you need any help or support, don't be afraid to shoot me a pm :)

DoritoFan55	Hey, would it be possible to create an application that would scan your replays and search for inconsistencies/misplays? I've been interested in doing this, recently. Unfortunetely, the only languages I know is python and a little c++. Also, how could the code be used maliciously? I'm thinking getting the opponent's elixir?  EDIT: Also, I know you can't show th code for how you get the stats from cr's servers, but could you tell the method? I also know HTML and CSS, btw.
DoritoFan55	Thanks for the help! I've almost figure everything out.
DoritoFan55	Ok, thanks! I might try to emulate CHIP-8 first
DoritoFan55	Okay, so I'm confused about how I'm supposed to make a CHIP-8 emulator. What language should I use, and what should I write?
DoritoFan55	And so, if I understand correctly, emulating things is just making functions for all the things and listing the operation codes? Or am I getting my terms mixed up?

DoritoFan55	Well, let's see. I'm at 3700 now playing under leveled log bait, so my skill is respectable. I'm a pro at picking draft cards, especially when it's for specific cards, as I know what can counter and what doesn't.  Your teammate leaves? Boom, you lose. I'm not saying it happens all the time, but every time it DOES, that's 1/3 to losing.  Your teammate picks spear goblins over pekka? Yeah, who in the right mind could think that you could carry that guy? Don't get me wrong, I can carry people pretty well, but if you have THAT little skill... Jesus, what am I even supposed to do?  I can also say that my card placement is pretty accurate. After playing for over a year, I've gotten used to knowing where to place stuff. Hell, I can place a inferno tower in the right spot with a blindfold on.  And if I'm matched with a idiot from builder's workshop, I can assume I'm screwed. Cause that guy has no f-ing idea about what to do..  So, all in all, I did win on my third try. But due to sheer luck, after having four afk players in a row on the second match, and countless players from lower arenas, I made it. But jeez, some of the bad plays I saw were just stupid.

mariana9012	Just need a place to let some of it out. | I've been in queue to chat for over an hour at National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. I'm afraid to call after reading their privacy policy and that they can and will call the police at their discretion.    Basically I just feel done with life. I messed up too badly and permanently too many times to fix it. I am full of regret and self-loathing and I can't stand it but though I have the means to do it, I won't. Just because of my family members I believe love me and my two dogs. My husband is away for work for a few months and there wouldn't be anyone to take care of them if I do it. Plus no one would love them like I do.   I thought having more to do would give me that sense of purpose instead of all this despair. But I can't do the things I want to most (ruined those opportunities via life decisions that cannot be unmade) so instead I....started grad school. While working full time. In a program I chose ONLY because I could get tuition reimbursement from work. So now my days are absolutely filled and all I want to do every second of every day is go to sleep and never wake up.    I guess I don't really have a point, I just wanted to talk and think someone was listening. 
mariana9012	I've recently accepted I won't ever have my own family. And that I was always too repulsive to have ever had that as one of my life goals. I have some painful physical issues that have gotten worse as I've gotten older which has made me drop the goal to travel. These were/are things for a younger woman to do. So that really just leaves work. Unfortunately, I have always seen work as the thing I have to do to pay for 'real life.' I am trying so hard to get into the headspace that work IS life. That is what everyone has been trying to tell me my whole life. And this program very likely will lead to a career instead of just a job. I have been trying for months to convince myself that's just what I should do. It will fill up my time and my thoughts. I just don't have any balance, never did, in life. 
mariana9012	I should have used past tense. "Wanted" to do most. I would say I honestly don't want to do those things anymore. I don't want to do anything at all. I used nothing but logical reasoning to decide to go to grad school - much higher pay, can do it for not too much debt (tuition reimbursement), can be done in 2 years. I told myself I'd be crazy not to take advantage of this opportunity. I still agree with myself. I just don't have my heart in it. I can't think of anything at all I want to do. I can't even entertain myself anymore. I figured school and then a potentially better job is a way to kill time until I die. You know?
Temp1977	Kleinfelters/ intersex | I have a condition called Kleinfelter's where I have two x chromosomes and a y. It's is an intersex condition. I'm heterosexual and quite popular with women but avoid relationships because of this. I have a female shaped body, OCD, extreme anxiety, depression, fatigue, am very baby faced and tend to put on weight in the areas a woman would boobs, hips, butt and feel i am a freak of nature.  Too much information I know and I don't want to come across as a creep but I only have a slightly over 5 inch penis and feel i never went through puberty normally. I would just like to be in a relationship and have a family and not feel like a physical and mental freak of nature and a human being worthy of respect and love. I'm not some alpha male that wants to be with loads of women I just want to not feel like a sub human that's destined to be alone for the rest of their lives.  Anyway rant over I am pretty close to the edge and would like to get my story out as I never want anyone else to go through a sad, lonely life where you genuinely wish you were never born. Thanks for listening needed to get this off my chest.
Temp1977	Am in England NHS wheels move slow still waiting for referral. GP sister in law positive I haven't got it from history. I know its weird to talk about with your sister in law but have been on the brink on suicide due to this. Feel free to PM me if you like take care :)
Temp1977	Women at work and some female friends tell them. I don't react but might accidently tell a joke at a later date when they're in earshot which picks apart one of their insecurities. I rarely do it but if I'm in a pissed off mood I might, it's mean but hey taste a bit of your own medicine lol.
Temp1977	No equivalent I can think of. If there was the issue would be treated seriously and sympathetically by the media not ruthlessly mocked and the butt of jokes.
Temp1977	Some fucked up and shitty responses to a woman pouring her heart out. Really sorry for your loss and thanks for the kind words and encouragement. I've got the problem of being rusty and inexperienced sexually due to huge anxiety and body dysmporphia so have a double whammy. Should be experienced but am not greatly and don't want to look a fool, need to find a way to get past it. Anyway wish you all the best in the future thanks for the post.
Temp1977	Don't laugh would be the main thing. I'm super small flaccid so the unveil is always a nightmare. I tend to discuss it myself with women and am open to using toys etc so just be respectful. Obviously don't talk about it to your friends or laugh behind our backs those are probably the two biggest fears of small dick guys. Remember we want sex to be awesome for you so sensitive and respectful communication is key.
Temp1977	Real shame you were bullied out, you rock and I feel you had nothing but good intentions. I like female presence hear although sometimes feel I'm in the minority on this one. It's just the chance of meeting someone like you in real life seem really slim, unicorms do exist just wish I had a radar for them ha.
Temp1977	Showering at school and being mocked left a lasting impression on me. Female friends and working in hospital with lots of small dick jokes haven't helped either. Sex should be exciting and instinctual as opposed to having a borderline panic attack each time your with someone new. Makes me very envious of women and average guys who don't have to deal with this monumental head fuck.
Temp1977	I'd be in two minds to tell someone whether to speak to a therapist as I used to have a work colleague who trained as psychologist but never practised who used to make small dick jokes all the time. You could be trying to talk through your issues and they either don't get it or are secretly laughing inside.
Temp1977	It's annoying when family members and friends constantly ask why your single. It's caused me to deliberately ghost friends due to embarrassment. I hated big family do's where I constantly turn up single and everyone else was coupled up made me feel like a freak. I've even changed jobs because of it. I hope you can get over your hang up and give it a go with this girl.
Temp1977	When people don't experience something first hand they say annoying things. I struck up the courage to talk to a therapist re penis size issues and she compared anxiety over a small dick to women's anxiety over the size of their feet or thighs. She told me watching naked attraction would be good therapy as it shows all body types. If I went on that show I'd be laughed at and voted off immediately. Some women complain about being treated like sex objects, it's a whole lot better than being treated like a freak and a joke who's totally undeserving of sex.
Temp1977	Sometimes it's passed down from genetics sometimes it's just bad luck too much oestrogen in the womb, hypogonadism etc. My dad and brother are normal ( I played sports with them lol) and I'm def not. Saying that with my genetics I would feel exceptionally guilty ever giving birth to a boy knowing how fucked and suicidal at times I've been due to feeling like a freak. It sucks that due to things outside your control your chances of a life you want are greatly diminished. It also makes you bitter as you see people and women as the shallow superficial judgemental things they are.
Temp1977	Don't know why women do that, there regarded to be the more sensitive of the sexes and they never assume that if you have a small dick comments like that rip you apart I've had it countless times from so called female friends and it makes me want to turn into a social recluse. Sorry your going through this can totally relate. Having a small dick is a weird one as people and women treat you with respect and dignity when they think your normal and like shit when they realise your not. People are generally cunts to those who fall outside the social and physical norms, men and women.
Temp1977	That's why I find therapy for small dick issues to be a waste of time. It gives you false confidence and then reality punches you in the face after all the feel good bullshit when you get rejected and talked about. Therapy is probably very good for true body dsymorphia a smaller than average dick is sadly not in the mind as other peoples reactions will immediately tell you. Doomed to a life of mockery and lonely ness due to shitty genetics fantastic.
Temp1977	Revenge is definitely justified. Sounds like a good plot starter for a horror film. Sadly In real life you'd end up in prison for that ha. I'd think of a devious way to fuck him over though, taking the moral high ground will get you walked over in life. He's clearly a cunt though and you need to remove him from your life as soon as is practical, difficult with him being your roommate however.
Temp1977	Social Issues from small dick. | I work with mostly women and for some reason have mostly female friends and hear occasional dick jokes. This never used to bother me but at 5 X 4.8 nbp every time I hear them now I take them as a personal attack. I posted on small dick problems and was told I have body dsymorphia but I don't believe the average bone pressed is 5.5 for a second. It's got to the stage where I've stopped responding to texts from most of my friends (female) and am much less friendly (but still not rude) at work.  I'm starting to resent them and feel increasingly dejected. I feel like every single one of them would laugh at me and mock me if only they knew. One of my best friends comes round and she wants to watch naked attraction which makes me feel like shit. Don't know what to do, any advice on how to get over this mental fuck up as it's leading to serious depression and apathy?
Temp1977	No I didn't you don't have to say if you don't want to. Looking back I really wish I did, I kept it inside. I work in healthcare and I now some Drs too, they wont be remotely bothered by you saying it. In the end I told a female Dr re penis size issues (was embarrassed and shaking pathetic I know) and she was very understanding. Referred me to Endochronolgy and Urology (nothing came of it), who knows with you they might find something. My advice would be to do both, but you don't have to. All the best good luck.
Temp1977	Totally understand the anger have you been to a doctor or psychiatrist regarding the anger. I think most of us on this sub have been there. Difficult to tell where your problems lie without a accurate measurement also. Pisses me off that a problem which makes many suicidal is a fucking joke to most people. I've been there hope you pull through this. Had to go antidepressants for the same issue myself at times I would almost blank female friends and felt people would be laughing at me if only they knew what I looked like, fucked me up deeply but it can pass. Please don't kill yourself over this man, from someone who's been there and yes I know it fucking sucks.
Temp1977	Sorry, its cos I look like a fucking Greek statue flaccid (the only part being the cock and balls sadly). Wasn't my intention to piss anyone on this sub off. Wanted to give advice to help people medically.
Temp1977	Game of thrones is over rated any way. Jofrey was evil and had a small dick to I think. The GOT creators are obsessed with dicks, see south park's very funny game of thrones episode. Maybe it's time to say the evil female characters are so because of a fat arse and small tits (which they shouldn't) and watch the SJWs go ape over body shaming. 
Temp1977	Hormonal issues/ Kleinfelters | Does anyone here have any other weird body and mind stuff as well as a small dick. I have long arms, baby face, curves like a woman, don't put on muscle easily, small balls, OCD, autism and anxiety.   I'm due to get tested for Kleinfelters it's too late for my penis to grow now, but if you do please go the doctors whilst your in puberty as it's been the biggest regret of my life. I was too ashamed to go this was 20 years ago now. My flaccid penis looks childlike and I have peno scotal webbing which makes it look much smaller which until recently I never knew you could get surgery for. I'm 5 x 4.7 nbp but look more like 4 due to the webbing.  It's had a huge impact on my life, avoiding jobs where I would have to shower (have been laughed anytime anyone's seen me flaccid), stopping team sports, friend zoning nice women, ie the nurse who was really nice but looked at dicks all day long and I was too ashamed to pursue her despite her persistence. Missing out on friends with benefits and one night stands, some people assumed I was gay , not that being gays a problem obviously.  It sucks as I'm sure you all know, sitting with female colleges at work while they laugh about small dicks, not knowing you have felt suicidal about it, that it's really hurtful and you have to sit there and say nothing. It's helped shape my piss poor self esteem and alienated me significantly in life.   Anyway vent over, long time lurker appreciate the support of the sub as it's an issue which eats us up inside but we can't talk to anyone about it. Don't mean to piss off (def not my intention) smaller guys as I feel the hormonal stuff has truly fucked me up mentally in addition to dick size and look worries.
Temp1977	Have seen the pics after surgery looks fucked up. You'll have to explain why your shafts way thicker than the head of your dick too. Better come up with a story on that one. Should be a lot cheaper than 5k though.
Temp1977	Wouldn't have thought so. Small boobed women get support and reassurance from main steam society small dick men get shamed and stigmatised. Just look at the amount of google hits for worried about small dick, compared to worried about small boobs. A woman with small boobs isn't viewed as a terrible hate filled person. Plus if it was as easy to enlarge dicks as it is boobs this sub would be a lot more quiet.
Temp1977	Nice to know as someone with anxiety issues due to hormonal problems which caused my small dick that I effectively have 2 small dicks lol. Also as someone who grew up with the rave scene taking two drugs that make it difficult to get erect and one (MDMA) which shrinks anyone's dick to laughable proportions may just be some of the worlds shittiest advice, at least you'll be having fun in the process though.
Temp1977	Definitely double standards . Women suffer from them but so do men too and it's rarely reported. The body acceptance movement is hypocritical bullshit which picks and chooses what's okay to target. Also women's feelings are viewed as Important men's aren't. I find it no surprise why the male/female suicide gap is increasing and no one seems to give a shit.
Temp1977	Years of shame, bullying, suicidal thoughts, been constantly told that your inferior and worthless, and that your most likely a terrible evil person because of a genetic trait you had no control over. It's an issue that leads to depression and sometimes suicide, yet is still viewed by the vast majority of men and women as a joke. That's why.
Temp1977	Thanks a lot appreciate the support.
Temp1977	Kleinfelters Advice | I have always felt different. I have a woman's shaped body, long arms, baby face, didn't shave until 25, tend put weight on hips and stomach, have to work out to avoid man boobs. Am tall for my family but not overly, I also have mild autism and anxiety, am shy and very feminine for a man. Always felt that I never went through pubertal changes like everyone else (penis never grew, no body hair at all until 25)  I have seen an Endochrinolgist who did hormone levels, all normal, he said I had normal sized testicles - or at least within the normal range as was my penis. He has discharged me, do any of you think a karotype blood test would be useful as I have many KF symptoms am also tired with poor muscle strength and endurance.   Any help would be greatly appreciated - thanks.
Temp1977	Unlikely to work, have tried sleeping pills and codeine. More likely to fuck you up. You wake up out of your head or end up in hospital it achieves fuck all but may give you bad health. If your depression is bad now it will be worse if you mess your health up believe me I know. Ring a crisis line. You can PM me to if you like. I've been there can relate won't judge.
Temp1977	Thanks thought I should do
Temp1977	Can relate loved playing sport but gave up entirely due to this. Have always avoided any activity which involves nakedness, go to gym but shower at home. Dread having to go to hospital even. Can you blag an excuse why you can't do PE.
Temp1977	Your a similar size to me although I'm smaller flaccid, think Greek statue size and look smaller erect due to a peno scrotal web. Have zero confidence but mines primarily comes from my flaccid. Most people who've seen me flaccid have laughed but with you i'd say your erect size is fine especially for your country. You need to feign confidence good luck.
Temp1977	Have peno-scrotal webbing makes it look even smaller, cant afford surgery either plus I'm uncircumcised too which also makes it look smaller. That's a safe-ish surgery too - fucking annoying.
Temp1977	Non bone pressed but I know both down to the decimal inch plus I'm not fat. Even none bone pressed gives me a good half to one inch that I feel doesn't count as visual as I've got penoscotal webbing too fml. Dick looks like 4 inches not 5
Temp1977	Have depression as well so If you could fix both that as well I'm taking the normal body and mind. My life would have gone in a very different direction not having to friend zone awesome women and denying opportunities for relationships:(
Temp1977	Thanks for the kind words hope you are well x
Temp1977	Wow lots of scary similarities to my life - small dick, piss poor self esteem and alcoholic dad great combo thanks for that god. Friend zoning women you don't want to eats away at you big time have really struggled with this too. Glad thinks are now working out for you.
Temp1977	Make and listen to music. Like to look at modern art too.
Temp1977	If you've got a thin dick circular motion is your friend - look it up
Temp1977	At 5.5 nbp you might not be ideal but your fine most of us aren't that lucky. Especially if you've got good girth. Under 5 nbp is where you may start having problems still possible though
Temp1977	Sounds like it could be. I have similar stuff - long arms, tall for family, low muscle tone for a man, baby face, almost pear shaped body, plus autistic (mild) and anxiety. Thought I had Kleinfelters or excess oestrogen when I was in the womb. You need to see an endochrinologist to review hormone levels, they can test for xxy (Kleinfelters) also. You could also see a urologist. Sadly too late to make your dick bigger. Do you have small balls or man boobs if so get tested. I work in healthcare as do most of my family so have some background info on this. Good luck pulling for you.
Temp1977	How small do you reckon?
NothingNever	I'm so tired of the costant need to express myself, to vent, to create but being to disheartend and anxious to do anything at all | it's 4 am and i've been here writing half-sentences and deleting them for the past hour. I had to made a new account, just to come here and whine, out of fear of being judged by people looking through my account like there was something to hide or be ashamed of
zafkaf	I don't know when I might kill myself, but I'm tired of being alone | Having perspective, my life could be so much worse I get it. I have a roof over my head, I have some money to feed myself, I've had some good times in the past. Yet, this isn't enough I realise. Selfish right. I have come to horrible realisation that I really do hate who I am. I used to like myself. I used to like how small and quirky I thought I was, how I liked culture, how people liked me. Now I realise people only like the surface of me, meeting me briefly is a pleasant account. I'm polite and nice but really, I have nothing to say when it comes to longer convos. I went to uni for a bit, put myself out there to meet loads of people but now I hardly keep in contact with anyone. I took a year out and this summer has been hard because almost everyone I know has had a good time with friends and family, even strangers that pop up on my facebook are having a better time than me. I now have had to delay going to uni due to how depressed I am. All I have been doing is sitting in bed depressed. I try to leave the house and do things but I do thing alone most of the time. Another thing is, I don't have a close family. I hardly speak to my mum. She feeds me and gives me money but we don't have any connection and I never really knew my dad, I don't have any close relatives who I speak to, I'm not ethnically English so I stand out from that, I look younger for my age, I've not been in a relationship, I was in care for many years but I don't keep in contact with the foster carers (long story) I knew, I have no basis. I went to a posh uni but came from poor background/area and grew apart from most people I went to school with. Having no constant socialising, I get lonely. I thought about trying to go out and meet new people but realise I'm not interesting enough. Even having a family you get on makes you more interesting. Even having friends you frequently do stuff with or chat you makes you more interesting. I don't have those things. I thought about reaching out to people I do know but most of them have their own lives and haven't really replied to me when I have started convo or tried to arrange to hang out. I am currently lounging at a friends house for free, his mum has been so nice and good to me but I now just feel guilty and if I do kill myself, it's going to hurt her as well as my friend. His mum doesn't even know me that well, I've just rocked up and she's taken me in. If it was a case of 'oh I need somewhere to stay' then fair, I wouldn't feel too too bad but its the fact that I am also so depressed you know... I have other carers but they don't always contact or message me. They help me when I need it but can go ages without talking to me. Again, did I do something wrong to make them not give that unconditional love I feel like I deserve? My friend works loads now so I don't see him which is good because I don't want to burden him with what I'm going through entirely (don't want to explain this one, I have my reasons). I need to get a job so I can start paying my friend's mum back. I'm in a new city and don't know anyone really. I don't think I'm really really strange or anything. I just think everyone has been way luckier than me in life. life has a funny way of making you feel guilty to be safe and lucky but will throw shit at you all the time until you can't cope. I'm a nice person. Before being where I am now, I was at uni and met few people who liked me. But they've all drifted from me and I also lived with people who weren't nice to me and I had nothing in common with. I think a lot of life is luck. I put myself out there but I got nothing back. I think maybe it's also due to where I came from and who I am personality wise that I can't hold down strong friendships. My facebook is full of people reminiscing funny shit they did with each other or photos with each other sayin how much they all love each other. All I long for is connection and unconditional love from some people. I want to discuss funny times, have good memories with people, share good things, invest time to grow and have hobbies, can go for drinks with people without feeling so empty. And when I do meet people, I've been stuck in my depression bubble for so long that I have nothing to say to people. I don't care about my hobbies anymore. I am useless. I'm 21 living in the UK. There's no hope anymore, no help. Don't worry, I've tried to get help but it will stay like this as long as I am living this shitty life. Maybe some people were meant to not live...

WlDOWBREAK3R	This is stupid, I don't care. | I just had a nightmare, or a dream, in which my loved ones stopped loving me because of my mental illnesses.   I am currently freaking out because of it because it's very possible and I am terrified of losing them but recovery has been so fucking hard on me I don't think I'm ever going to get there.   I'm terrified and alone and- the worst part of all, this dream made me wanna do nothing BUT kill myself... and, I'm honestly debating on doing it.   My life feels like and endless loop of "Hey, you need to recover" and "Hey, you need to kill yourself" and I am conflicted and heartbroken. I fee like I will NEVER be loved unconditionally as long as my mental illness is around.  I wanna kill my self but if I fail then they will leave me. I am freaking out. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Can you imagine LOOKING like you smell like a Denny's bathroom? 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Weird, for sure, a bit disturbing, but not THAT trashy. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	It's not high school that is the problem for me. I don't care about people there and I don't have problems with grades or bullying. It's simply my life outside of it that's the problem.  
WlDOWBREAK3R	What is that omg 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Hang out with him, stay with him, let him know you are there and love him. Get him around other family who can do the same. Make sure he is involved and treated good. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Maybe you should look into if you have a digestive issue or something more? I'm sure it's coincidental it always happens at important times, but it probably happens at school or other inconvenient times too.   Please don't kill yourself. I hope things go well and easy and you don't have disaster strike at another inconvenient time.   Bad luck is the worst, but I'm sure it's merely coincidental.   Best of luck, if you need / wanna talk, message me. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	that's so cool! i love that. i've always wanted to learn something less well known. i'm happy for you! good job! you're doing great :D
WlDOWBREAK3R	Struggling to get my sleep schedule back on track, looking for advice for stubborn people who just can't get out of bed in the morning. | I start school in less than a month. There's no problem with that except for the fact that I have been sleeping till 7/8 PM and going to sleep at 6/7/8 AM.   I often try to set an alarm so the latest I wake up is at 11 AM or noon, maybe 2 PM at best, but my stubborn, tired ass always turns them off.   I have melatonin tablets, if anyone has advice on how to use those to fix my sleeping. I know they're not meant to help me sleep.   I would like to fix this without having to stay up for 24 hours and go to bed "early". Staying up for a whole day and going to sleep early is not an option for me due to various mental illnesses. Being awake longer than 10-12 hours is absolute hell and makes me feel like trash even more so than I would without sleep.   I'm looking for any sort of tips and advice, even stuffed that worked for others personally.  Please help, I am not looking to go to school this upcoming 26th on zero sleep. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	this is for taking me for granted & this is also for me saying that manipulative stuff to you. | 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Please don't do it. I know you feel awful as of lately, but if you need to vent I am here. Stay safe and stay another day. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	This might be a stupid question and/or insensitive but what is that? I'm genuinely curious and don't mean this rudely. Take care. ❤️
WlDOWBREAK3R	I'm so serious about killing my self and nobody is taking me seriously. | I have been looking for someone to vent to but nobody cares about me.  I ... have a history ? I guess of failed attempts everyone just thinks I don't mean it and I'll be fine but I am very desperate. Anything helps. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Thank you so much 🌹
WlDOWBREAK3R	thank you! so much. you too. 🌹
WlDOWBREAK3R	tysm 🌹
WlDOWBREAK3R	I understand. Everyone I talk to just gets mad at me or upset themselves. It sucks. :( 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Genuine questions I would like an opinion on from multiple people. | I'm debating on killing myself soon, as I don't have another choice.  - Should I break up with someone before I kill myself? - Is it bad to write a suicide note to no one specific when you've got a boyfriend of almost 3 years?  - Do I write each person I'm in contact with a note?  - How do I know I'm close enough to someone to include them in a note?    
WlDOWBREAK3R	I suggest hydrogen peroxide & bandaids ! Maybe rubbing alcohol, but that will burn. Ointment. 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Not gonna lie, I relate to this too much.  Being depressed or horny are two things that take up such a huge amount of another persons attention, except, ones not as miserable feeling.  
WlDOWBREAK3R	when you don't want to be alone but don't have anyone to vent to at the same time. | 
WlDOWBREAK3R	I'm not sure if this post is appropriate for this sub, but here goes. I'm desperate. | I can't get the idea that I should just kill myself out of my mind.  I'm going to be done with school and done with everything I need to do.   I feel like suicide is all I have left at this point.   I can't get a job anywhere. I haven't even had a job before. I have applied for multiple. Nobody wants me, I'm too awkward and terrible.   I have one person who genuinely would feel like shit if I died, and that's my boyfriend.   I have no one in terms of people to vent to. I am unable to get help because of family situations and lack of being able to pay for it myself, because, again, nobody wants me around.  Although my boyfriend is supportive of me, he can't be expected to support his boyfriend who can't even talk about his problems easily. He can't support me when he has a job of his own.   I feel so alone and useless and I feel like I literally have no other choice but to kill myself before or after graduation this 2018.   Life isn't good for me, there's so much wrong with life right now and I've been trying to keep myself alive for years now. It's just recently gotten bad again. I started self harming again and I want to die.   I'm unsure of what to do. I don't know if suicide is really my last choice but it seems that way.   It is either suicide or a life of failure, because I am not successful or anything good in life.  
WlDOWBREAK3R	Still looks painful, take care of that & be safe. ❤️
WlDOWBREAK3R	sorry for the ugly picture but i finally got a bit deeper on my second relapse after a month. you can see the thinner cuts, then the smaller but wider one. i'm proud and i am gonna try for wider. | 
WlDOWBREAK3R	Relapsed for the first time in months. Starting small. | 
Seventh_Seeker	I'm a loser who ruined his own life. I'm hopeless, desperate and barely functioning. | Hello, people of Reddit.  This is going to be a long one, so I don't blame you if you decide to skip it, but I'll be infinitely grateful if you decide to read it all.   I apologize in advance for writing so much, but I believe a summary of my life story is necessary to understand my current situation. I'll try to ramble as little as possible, but I make no promises. I'm Sorry. I'm hurting right now.  My situation:  I'm a 28 year old male (I can't call myself a man) from Argentina. I have reached this age with no college degree (currently studying Systems Engineering, but not really enjoying it, so I only completed a year worth of courses). Never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. Only in the last two years I've got a stable job as a programmer. Previously I only worked temporary crap jobs, and was unemployed for a long time. I don't really enjoy my current job all that much (not sure if because of depression or maybe this isn't the line of work for me), but I'm aware there are worse alternatives.  I live with my mother (not enough money to move alone, and it feels like an impossible task) and her new husband who kinda hates me.  I've always been a little chubby, but since I finished high school, my life has become very aimless and unfocused, and now I'm VERY overweight (115 kg / 253 pounds). I have tried to stay on a diet, but I always break the streak and I don't have a lot of time to exercise and my asthma makes it had (though I'm treating it now).   What's worse, in the last year I've started to lose a LOT of hair (I'm getting shots in my scalp with a dermatologist while trying to figure out the cause of the hair loss). My hairline has receded dramatically, the hair on the top of my head is becoming very thin and sparse, and I have little bald-ish "spots" on some parts. I think this was the breaking point for me.  I fear now I will never be attractive enough for a woman to like me (or for me to like myself). I am afraid that it's too late to change my future now, to have a life, to have what others have..  And due to my lack of enthusiasm for my career, I feel I may never get a better job, and will probably be fired eventually. What's worse is, I used to be a straight A's (or 10's here) student. It was the only thing I was good at, and I've wasted all that pontential.. This brings me great guilt and pain.  It has gotten to a point where I can barely do my job anymore. My constant anxiety and depression has seriously hurt my work performance. I CRY at work, almost every day (I try to hide it, I'm not sure if it has worked). And I cry when I return home, unless I can get momentarily distracted with videogames.  I know men are expected to be tough and not cry, especially because of such "silly" minor things like depression. But I've reached the breaking point. Even my mother (who was there for me when I was bullied in high school and wanted to kill myself) is tired of hearing about me feeling sad.  In short, I am the living description of a loser. I am the worst stereotype of a geek loser (except I'm not even that smart, or maybe I've gotten dumber with time).  And I'm hopeless, I can't see any possible future in which I accomplish the things I desire. In which I'm even a moderately successful human being.  I can barely function these days, I cry all the time, can't see my reflection in mirrors without turning away in disgust. My soul is bleeding. I can't see light at the end of the tunnel. And I feel huge amounts of guilt and shame.  Guilt, for all the bad decisions that brought me to this place in life, for wasting whatever potential I had, and for complaining about my current situation when there's kids starving in Africa and yadda yadda.. (Well guess what, thinking about starving children doesn't make me feel better about my current situation, it only makes me feel sad for the starving children, in addition to myself).  And shame, for the thing I have become: a pathetic and repulsive human being. An example of how not to live.   I saw a journalistic video on YouTube the other day, about the thing that happened in Charlottesville in the USA, there was a Neo-Nazi rally and someone died, and the journalist described the nazis as pathetic, ugly porn-addicted virgin losers.. Well, I guess I'm as bad as a Nazi then, even though I find their ideology repulsive and I'm horrified at what happened.  Sorry for the long post. I'm just speaking from the heart. I'm hopeless and terrified. I have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. I haven't been to one since I started working full time, and it didn't do much for me then, though in restrospective I wasn't being too open in therapy back then, I will change that now.  Thank you for reading.  Seriously, you're a kind person for taking time to read this. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	I've (21/F) successfully recovered from my anorexia over the years. I'm very body positive and learned how to love myself and appreciate my body but my boyfriend (22/M) makes me want to relapse again. | My boyfriend has been throwing my weight in my face this past few months. He doesn't believe that I've grown to love my body and I'm starting to feel like he doesn't like that I've obviously gained weight over the years. He makes me feel guilty for my weight gain.  When I was 17 the pressure of looking a certain way due to my cultural background took over my life. I was at a healthy weight (125-130 lbs) but my Mom and Aunts would constantly tell me I would look a lot better if I was 100 lbs. My height was 5'4 by the way.   During that time I found myself slowly starving myself. I limited my meals to a cracker and 1/4 a cup of rice. I slowly began to stop eating and just drinking coffee and water. I inflicted self-harm and would have scuicidal thoughts when I ate too much or I ate an extra cracker or even an extra pinch of rice. Then my weight drastically dropped down to less than 80 lbs. I was a walking skeleton.   I would crave candy and put the candy on my table and stare at it for days feeling my mouth salivating. When I gave in and ate the piece of candy I would cut myself as punishment because the pain from cutting myself would make me not want to eat. I conditioned myself to the point I was my own prisoner in my own body. It was evident to everyone around me that I was anorexic and it was not natural.   I had scuicidal thoughts and tried to take sleeping pills to kill myself but I wasn't successful I was just throwing up. I felt that if I could kill myself and leave the easy way out I wouldn't have to experience the pain of anorexia.   Fast forward to present day I am 21 now. I've recovered remarkably and I've learned to love my body and self-image. I've gained my weight back and I don't get intrusive scuicidal thoughts of wanting to off myself whenever I eat.   The problem is my boyfriend would mention my weight a lot. He knows my story about my recovery from anorexia and bulimia but he doesn't care he just throws how much I've gained weight to my face.   Last night my boyfriend and I were out with friends bar hopping and we ended the night by eating at a Mexican restaurant. I got the jack cheese spinach enchiladas. It was delicious and one of the best enchiladas I've had. My friend and I were talking about how healthy this meal is compared to the fajitas and my friend and I sarcastically said, "This is totally going to make me fat."   My boyfriend blurted out, "Well you're going to be fat no matter what." He obviously wasn't joking because he wasn't backing it up or saying that it was a joke. My friends looked at each other and went silent and looked at me. I played it off but I really wanted to run into the restroom and cry because I felt so confident that night but my self-esteem was crushed instantly.   When my boyfriend and I were driving home that night I wanted to ignore what he said because he was drunk and he gets angry easily when he's drunk. I mentioned about why he said that and he justified his remark about my weight by saying, "Well you were eating really fatty food it has a lot of calories." And I replied, "Wait why are you counting my calories. There was not a time I mentioned that I was afraid of eating the enchiladas?"   He continued and said, "Well two years ago you use to be so adamant about not gaining the weight you are now." I explained to him, "Well I was at a bad part of my life and I was recovering from anorexia. That was my eating disorder talking and I learned how to love my body and appreciate it, something I couldn't do when I was 17."   I kept trying to prove to him that I was body positive about myself and he kept saying, "I don't believe that you're body positive look how much weight you've gained." I replied, "I know I gained some obvious weight since we've met but I don't know why you can't understand I was recovering from anorexia and I still hated myself for eating when I first met you because I wasn't fully recovered. You don't understand what it feels like to have an eating disorder and feel pressured to look a certain way to please my cultural background and society. You don't understand how hard it was to recover especially with my Mom noticing I gained some weight and scolding me to lose weight again but I somehow recovered. It's not a self-made illness that I decided to inflict upon myself, it was a serious illness."   He just kept saying, "I don't believe that you're body positive I don't believe that you like the weight that you've gained." He continued to throw how much weight I gained into my face and he knew it was obviously hurting me. So he played it off and said he was just *joking*. I know he wasn't. By the time we got home I wanted to cry in his car but he told me to get out and cry in my car instead and he left me alone and helpless. I cried for hours because I felt like I was going to relapse again. I was doing so well loving myself and appreciating my body but last night I felt like I hated my self-image and I felt like I had no self-worth.   I haven't eaten all day. I have that feeling of being afraid to eat again. I'm afraid to consume calories because my boyfriend's remarks in the car and in front of my friends keep circulating in my mind. I was doing so good of not being afraid to eat and maintaining my weight in a healthy manner. I have that feeling again of not being able to please society or my boyfriend. I feel fat again. I feel ugly. I feel like it's happening again and I don't know what to do.   I was doing so good. I thought I was strong and I thought I fully recovered from my eating disorder but I guess I didn't. Thinking about food makes me scared and anxious right now. It's been years since I felt like this and my boyfriend somehow got me to relapse. My Grandma is having a birthday party and I'm already thinking of how I can avoid it so I don't have to eat.   I run regularly I always try to stay active and I eat healthy but he still throws my weight in my face as if it's nothing. I feel like I'm not good enough again and I haven't felt this way about my weight in years. I felt like nothingness all day and I've cried all day. My boyfriend left me to go to a baseball game and didn't say much to me. He knew the condition he put me in and I made it aware to him that I seriously am going to relapse but he doesn't take it seriously.   He just got home and hasn't said a word to me. I feel like everything is my fault.   UPDATE: I just found out he's been doing COKE at the baseball game.   Tl;dr My boyfriend made me relapse. I want to drastically lose weight again by starving myself. Also found out he's been snorting coke. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	I want to off myself today. | I had a violent eating disorder when I was 17. From throwing up to starving and not eating for days I found myself weighing less than 80 lbs I was 120-130 lbs before. Coming from an Asian background the pressure of looking a certain way got to my head. At the time, I've already had depression, anxiety, and PTSD. So trying to force myself to look a certain way took over my whole life and it was pretty evident for the people around me that I was slowly dying.   When I was extremely anorexic I would eat a ritz cracker and 1/4 of a cup of white rice and coffee. *That* was my meal for the day. When I tried to fight my anorexia as a teenager and try to eat candy or a piece of chips I would try to throw it up. When I couldn't I would have thoughts of killing myself. Nobody cared in my life. My mom loved the weight I was at and thought I was naturally losing weight. I remember cutting myself so deep and literally slashing my arm to the point my best friend at the time had to come over my house and knock down my door and hold me down so I wouldn't try to stab myself.   It became so bad every time I ate a cracker or rice or drank coffee I would want to kill myself because I wanted to keep my calories to 0. In my mind, killing myself was better than eating and gaining weight. I remember cutting myself because the pain was so great it made me not want to eat. I felt like if I was worried about the pain on my arms and legs then I won't think about eating. It was a vicious cycle. I'm 21 now and despite my rare intruding scuicidal thoughts I've gain my normal weight and it took a lot of self-loving.   This past few months my boyfriend would mention my weight and say that "you use to be so adamant about not gaining weight." And I would tell him, "Well I was recovering from my anorexia and my head wasn't right so of course I was going to say that." But he keeps trying to make me prove to him that I really am body positive.   You don't understand how hurtful it is when someone questions your body positive mindset. He's made me feel guilty about my weight. There's an obvious difference from how I looked when I met him and now but I'm not obese nor chubby. I've just gotten thick and grew a butt and breasts that I've ALWAYS wanted but he throws my weight in my face.   Just last night he was drunk and we were eating out and I said something jokingly about getting fat and he blurted out in front of my friends, "well you're going to be fat no matter what." I played it off for awhile but my friends shockingly looked at each other and me and texted me to make sure I was okay because what he said was really rude.   Progressively towards the night, specifically on the way home, he was justifying what he said by saying it's because I was eating fatty food (spinach enchiladas) and throwing my weight at my face. Obviously I cried because I felt so confident that night and I felt really beautiful. He continued to mention my weight and making me feel guilty about how I've obviously gained weight over the years and I told him, "I know I gained weight but I've learned to love myself over the years and I learned to love my body, something I couldn't do when I was 17 and it took a long time to recover."   He just continued to throw his opinion of my weight telling me, "I don't believe you that you're body positive." And I kept trying to insist and prove to him I was. By the time we got home I was crying because I felt like I was questioning my self-image and self-worth again. I wanted to cry in his car instead of crying at home and wake everyone up but he told me to get out of his car and go into mine instead. I went into my car and he left me crying alone.   The feeling I felt last night was the same feeling I felt when I was anorexic. That feeling of no self-worth. I didn't feel beautiful anymore. I didn't feel confident. I didn't feel like I was worthy. Those feeling were how I felt when I would cut myself and make myself throw up my food. I felt like teenager me. I felt that no one was here for me, not even my boyfriend, I felt completely alone.   It took a really long time to recover from my eating disorder. Now I feel like I'm relapsing. I'm thinking about how much I hate my weight now and how I just want to quickly dispose of my weight even if I have to starve. I'm thinking about how I hate my physical appearance and want to change it.   I thought I was strong. I thought I was better than this but I guess my boyfriend proved to me that I am weak. I am fat. I should feel guilty about my weight. I thought I was fully recovered from my eating disorder. I thought I'd never put myself in this situation where I would starve myself to slowly die. I feel so pathetic for relapsing. I feel like nothingness.   I'm in bed right now. I've been crying since 4 a.m on and off. My boyfriend is at a baseball game most likely going to get drunk and he doesn't care about how I feel. I don't even thinks he feels bad and he doesn't even know what's going through my head. I've realized I have no one. I don't even have my boyfriend. I have no one and I've realized there will be no one who cares about me in this world right now.   I want to off myself so bad so I don't have to feel like this because going through that traumatic experience again where I slowly die from starvation is a life not worth living. I rather slit my throat with my boyfriend's pocket knife and bleed to death right now instead of relapsing.   I'm sitting here thinking about if anyone would miss me if I killed myself right now. To be quite frankly honest, no one will miss me. Not my family. Not my friends. Not even my boyfriend. He's at a baseball game with his friends right now and he knows the condition I'm in. He's just going to get drunk to forget. I've come to accept that I don't even have him. No one will miss me. You guys will read this and I'll just be another Redditor to you.   I thought I was strong but I'm not. I'm weak. I really hate myself. I feel like this is the day I want to give up. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	I've recovered from my Anorexia. I've learned to love my body over the years and successfully gained my weight back but my boyfriend makes me want to relapse. | My boyfriend has been throwing my weight in my face this past few months.

HiIAmMeeseeks	It sucks to know that someone I love would never take the time to check up on me during a time I needed him. Basically just left me there when I was crying this morning and didn't say much to me. He just left. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	/u/jessesewell 
HiIAmMeeseeks	Go see a counselor, therapist. Anything. I took a semester off.. well not technically I took like one class and it helped me realize what I truly wanted in life. You should really take a semester off if it's stressing you out that much. It's okay if you don't know what you want in life. It's completely normal. Just know you're not the only one and you can always talk to someone. It's hard and frustrating right now and you probably feel doomed but it will all work out I promise you. Don't ever give up. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	You and you ex are so mature about this whole thing! I wish separated parents got along like you two. Your daughter has the best parents. :)
HiIAmMeeseeks	I was in a similar situation where I finally got over my eating disorder and I was finally gaining my weight back without relapsing. It wasn't unhealthy weight but it was obvious that I had gained a bit of weight. My boyfriend at the time was with me when I was skinny minny and I actually was very afraid of the whole "false advertising my size" kinda thing when I was trying to fix my weight problem. We had a discussion about my eating disorder and how I obviously gained some weight and I was afraid he wasn't going to be attracted to me anymore. He cried and told me, "why would you ever think I'm not going to love you anymore if you've gained some weight? I care more about your health."   I guess what I'm saying is not every guy thinks the same but every boyfriend who truly loves you would love you for who you are and vice versa. A person who truly loves you will *always* put your health first. A person who truly loves you will *accept* you for who you are. A person who truly loves you will be *attracted* to your personality not your physical appearance. Most importantly, a person who truly loves you would *never* make you feel like you're not beautiful. I don't know about you but a lot of the relationships I know never end well when someone is dating solely for appearance. He's thinking with his dick, not with his heart. I don't think he realizes how lucky he is to have someone who is *beautiful*, *amazing*, and *intelligent*. I really hope your boyfriend realizes what he's doing to you and become more supportive.   I don't know about you but the men I've dated who were so appearance-obsessed was part of the reason why it was so hard for me to fix my eating disorder. It was quite psychologically damaging for me and I know so many women around the world have been in this situation, too. You might think this situation of yours is not that big of a deal but eventually it'll increasingly bother you. Just know that it's difficult to make yourself feel beautiful when someone isn't attracted to you for who you are. There's only one way out of that situation. Sorry if I'm being a bit harsh, I just want the best for you. 
HiIAmMeeseeks	This makes me happy. 
Iwish999123	Anyone else go through phases with depression? | Like you're super happy one day the extremely depressed the next? Or you're happy in the morning the become depressed by afternoon and vice versa?
Iwish999123	That feeling of emptiness you have in your chest when you're depressed. | 
Iwish999123	Yes, you've explained how i feel perfectly. Thank you.
Iwish999123	I've tried that plenty of times but then always feel like i'm just forgetting the problem not fixing it, cause it always comes back.
Iwish999123	Thank you for your answer. You seem to be the only person who gave me an explanation. However I also feel that EGO plays a huge role in a person becoming offended.
Iwish999123	> I didn't say any of those things.  > I can absolutely say that. Social norms are handed down from one generation to the next. My parents taught me that asking someone's salary is rude. Most people that I know would say the same thing. Because we were taught that it is rude, we will be offended when someone asks.  >I can absolutely say that. Social norms are handed down from one generation to the next.      Is that not being a sheep? Just saying/doing what others say?  Everything I said is correct  I'm sorry but that's the definition of a sheep. 
Iwish999123	NO, it's not just it's rude. There's a reason someone finds it rude i just want to know the reason someone may find it rude. If you'd  be able to answer that question great and if you can't then don't respond to the  question. It's not rocket science. 
Iwish999123	No i'm not here for an argument. I came here looking for answer that you still haven't provided. Your anwser isn't valid i'm looking for answer which provides a deep understanding on the reasoning behind it. Not just "it's generally accepted that it's rude" You haven't explained why they'd be offended. Maybe if you had spent less time getting offended you would have that answer.
Iwish999123	So your going to hold an opinion that you don't understand? So what you're saying is be a sheep and say/do whatever most people are doing? Are you telling me don't think twice about something to see if makes any sense or not? A opinion is just a opinion it's subjective so why are you talking about it like objective fact? Wow that's not a life i'd wanna live. Sorry.
Iwish999123	What's the reasoning behind social norms then? You can't just say social norms. Do they get offended? did their ego become damaged? Do they place their self worth on money? I don't know hence why asked this question. 
Iwish999123	I'd like to understand the reasons behind why it's rude. Not just say it's rude.
Iwish999123	Me: "How much do you earn?"  Other guy: "HOW DARE YOU ASK ME HOW MUCH I EARN."  Me: "Dude we work in the same department, and can do a quick google search to find median salary for your position."  Other guy "Fuck off you inconsiderate rude asshole".  Me: "OK! WTF was that about."  
Iwish999123	Stop looking for attention. You're not really going to kill yourself tonight if you were you wouldn't be seeking attention.
Iwish999123	DAE think the world has become over-complicated and too stressful? | If it was only as simple as easy as hunt,eat,fuck then sleep.
Iwish999123	Does anyone else just wish they had a good paying, non stressful secure job and they'd be happy? | This is defiantly one of the biggest factor of my depression.
Iwish999123	I can't stand people who fake depression for attention. | [removed]
Iwish999123	It surely is an addiction for me.
Iwish999123	Anyone else always find something to be depressed about? | 
Iwish999123	I'm guessing you don't enjoy your job? Correct me if I'm wrong. 
Iwish999123	Yea, I guess we humans just want what we don't have. But then again everybody's different.
rondo_rajon	OMG THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER 
rondo_rajon	I feel so depressed about time | I feel like I waste too much time on stuff that I don't like doing. I don't like my job, I work 9 hours for a shit payment and I can't even save a single dollar from it, not cause I spend too much, I need to give 60% of my earning to my mum and other money that's left I need to pay the bills so I can't buy stuff and I can't have a good time or I can't save up for a car let's say. I have this girl that I've been for a year now and when I spend time with her it's all good, but when she's not here it just feel so alone, I have to work, come home, spend alone time because she is not from my town and I don't have a car so I can go to her place. And i'm just wondering, am I going to feel so alone all the time? What is the purpose of all this? I need a higher meaning, I feel like I can be so much more in life, like this isn't what I'm supposed to be, and who am I supposed to be, I feel like I can be great, I don't like doing much things, and my work is depressing as fuckk and I always come home tired..... I don't know what to do. Today I didn't go to job because I was just so bored... I need something in my life, I wanna be somebody, I don't wanna waste my time on things that I don't like doing. I wanna do the things that I love and that makes me happy. I don't wanna be unhappy!!!
rondo_rajon	ye I live in Serbia, 75 euros is nothing here man, can't save up for a car, can't save up for a vacation, can't save up for a bike, can't save up for a phone, can't save up for anything that I wan't
rondo_rajon	Should I give my mom money? | So, I live with my mum and sister for 24 years already. My mom had to pay for my education, which wasn't that expensive, she bought me everything so far... So when I turned 19 I got a job, it was only for 3 months, so I gave half of my payment to my mom. And that continued all the way till now. Now I am 24 I have a steady job with earning aroud 250euros a month and I have to give my mom atleast half, or let's say half is the minimum. And my sister gives her money too. So, how am I supposed to save any money if I give her half of my payment, and btw I need to split cost of all the bills in the house with my sister, which are roughly around 100euros. My mom lives with her parents, and she is working and she has earns 200euros/montly, because they are sick. Grandpa has alzhaimer and my grandma has dementia and a broken hip, so my sister and I live in this house alone, so paying bills seems okay to me.... So do you give money to your parents as well? If so, how much? 
rondo_rajon	but how do I tell her now, if I ask her if she took something she'll just deny it 
rondo_rajon	Did my girlfriend took something or nah | Hey guys, I don't know much about drugs, I only smoke weed now and then, and my GF is using exctasy, or was using not sure, she even tried speed, so anyway, I hang out with alot of people who take drugs and I know how they behave when on specific drug, my GF took exctasy when we were out on a rave and I know how she behaved, so, one night she was at her friends place and after that she came to my place, and I noticed she had bigger pupils, and after that I told her to throw away her gum, and after she did I noticed she was clenching her teeths. So I know after exctasy some people clench their teeth some don't. So I want to know if clenching is possible while doing speed also? And what drugs cause your pupils to be bigger and to clench teeth at the same time, except exctasy, because when I asked her if she took exctasy she told me she didnt, but I think she told me that because she knows I'm against her taking untrusty exctasy. Thanks in advace.
rondo_rajon	pure 10 
rondo_rajon	> G  yea it looks like one, but I guess it's a mix of some kind. Not yet, I found him last night and I worked first shift so I didnt have time to do anything, tomorrow after work I'm going to see the vet for the microchip and more details about the dog, and then I'm putting up flyers! 
rondo_rajon	can I bump this 
rondo_rajon	What breed is this? I guess it's not more than 2 months old and doesn't weight more than 3 to 6 killos [found it in my street] | 
rondo_rajon	[TOMT] (TV Show in early 2000's?) | Hey guys, when I was little idk maybe 10 years old, so let's say 2003 and around that, there was a TV show on a channel from my country [TV PINK if that's relevant] The show included superpowers I think they were a group, not sure if villans or not But the main character had super strenght and he was kinda buffed? I think so, and the other guy I can recall of was skiny? and he could like super jump on the cliff with no problem I can't remember anything more from it : /  They might even had a van I am not sure : ( 
rondo_rajon	my bad, it might even be from late 90's but i am not sure : / 
rondo_rajon	Que for 8 hours | So I've entered the que around 12pm and now it's almost 8pm and I am at 350 que position and when I entered the que I was around 900........ So what's the deal here pay to play? 
rondo_rajon	same, i've been in que since 11 am, almost 12 and now it's almost 6pm and i am still 450 in que, there's no way to play on this server unless you donate or unless you play at earlier/later hours, which sucks.

rondo_rajon	how to make your doge run away from your home(SAFE) | 
rondo_rajon	I had it only once in 2016, I had this one girl, and we broke up but continued seeing each other and having sex and stuff, but no1 knew about it and stuff, and she was really hurting me badly, i was trying to get back together but she would go and fuck around with anyone and i was really in pain, so i was really depressed af, i stopped eating, there were days where I would eat once only, i didnt drink water, i barerly went outside, i even started to get bruises all around my body, because i lost weight really fast and so suddenly, i had 68kg and i dropped to 58 in just a couple of weeks or a month not sure, I was in a really bad mood, but I just got over it. I was crying alot tho, screaming alot, was always nervous, and I met this one new girl that I really liked and with her I am now having  the best time in my life, and she helped me alot, I was kinda half way through with the depression when I met her, because TIME heals all. Trust me man, TIME HEALS. I know it sounds cheesy and clishe[?] I never trusted it, but it's the truth. 
rondo_rajon	u know it boi
rondo_rajon	thx

rondo_rajon	Problem loading inventory/VAC Bug/Can't join any server? CS:GO | Hello guys, recently my friend shared me his library games, and I wanted to play cs:go we did this last year and I was being able to play the game perfectly. Now I downloaded the game, installed it, entered it, I played vs bots because I was fixing the crosshair and the configurations.... Then when he invited me to play a game online it said that my files werent verified and that they are corrupted. Okay, I exited steam, reentered it, I verified my cache in cs:go properties, it was verified already, okay i entered the game but the problem was still there.... Oh btw, I can not load my invetory from cs:go at all..... And I can't join any games either..... I reinstalled steam/reinstalled game/deleted all local files/deleted all files/disabled firewall/disabled antivirus/ nothing worked...... I don't know what else could I do except reinstalling the whole god damn windows, but I'd rather not  do that..... So if any of you guys know what should I do, plz answer me...... : (  
rondo_rajon	the same thing happened to me now.  the same thing, and ofc i lost LP and the waiting time...... Does anyone know more about this or? What is happening

Fitzrock	All the very BEST my Friend! I want to start too. You're my Motivation!!!
Fitzrock	Go to YouTube for tips Bro. Trust me, it's all there. Just take some time. You got this. If you appreciate my comment, please upvote, thanks.
Fitzrock	Believe me Bro, you're miles ahead of people like me who desperately want to start something and never do. Don't quit, success takes time. E.g. A baby takes 9 months to make, it can't be done in 1 week. Keep putting in that work. You've got traction.
Fitzrock	Sounds like because of time priorities, it would probably be best to pursue revenue streams where you only do the work once. Examples - Course Notes, Video Courses etc.  P.S. If you like this comment, please upvote. Thanks
Fitzrock	I once read an article where it said every year someone has the idea of an Events App or a Rent Books service. If you think it can be done, test it out on a small scale first and as cheaply as possible. Wishing you all the very best.
Fitzrock	Look at it this way Bro. Existing Competition = Idea Validation + Case Studies. Google was not the first search engine. Facebook was not the first social media site. Both entities in the beginning entered markets with previously existing players but they provided a different and better product.
Fitzrock	I wish for you Success!!!
Fitzrock	All the very best.
Fitzrock	Use Instagram and post daily with 30 hashtags relevant to your niche. It is a superbly powerful platform for reach
Fitzrock	Awesome, if you like my comment, please upvote. Thank you
Fitzrock	Check out Quora, Reddit, Yahoo Answers. Look for relevant questions surrounding your type of products. Also check out their ad platforms.
Fitzrock	Hand him a copy of the book 'The E-Myth' by Michael Gerber. It essentially shows how to franchise ones business and to work on the business, not in it.
Fitzrock	Become the most reliable person there and don't be afraid to go beyond the call of duty. It pays off in the long term and is valuable experience.
Fitzrock	Competition = Validated Idea + Case Studies. Facebook was not the first Social Media company. Google was not the first Search Engine. Both provided different and better products. Go forth and succeed!
Fitzrock	Don't forget offline methods including Newspapers, Classified Ads, Notice Boards, etc
Fitzrock	Find questions relating to your Products or Services on forums. Provide the solutions to questions with a link to your website.
Fitzrock	Just pick the Colours and move ahead. You should really be spending more time validating your idea and making sales Bro. All the best!
Fitzrock	Communication is key. Document everything step by step.
Fitzrock	Go on Fiverr.com and build your Profile. Some minor skills can lead to hundreds of dollars in income per Job. All the best Bro.

Fitzrock	All the best Bro. Have you tried Fiverr?

Fitzrock	I created an online entertainment news service but after two years and 72,000 followers realized that no one really wants to pay for advertising.    My next business venture, I wish to create an online automated service that solves a real problem that people are willing to pay for.... but what????
Fitzrock	Hi Friends!  Check out www.instagram.com/eventsjamaicamobileapp for Jamaican Events, Lifestyle and Entertainment :)
Fitzrock	Do you sell a product or service people pay monthly for? How did you come up with your idea? | [removed]
Fitzrock	Great Job! Continue doing Great things :)
Fitzrock	Loved this video. My greatest struggle is trying to create a valuable solution for a problem that people would pay monthly for.  Due to this barrier, I haven't started a Business yet.  It seems so impossible.
Fitzrock	The thing about Vacations is that you know it's a Vacation. Eventually you'll have to return to the same problems you wanted a break from.... :( | 
Fitzrock	May be you're right. The challenge is, I keep getting put in the friend zone by multiple females. It SUCKS and I just want to change it but I'm not sure how. To me there's no point 'hanging out' of there is little or no chance of sex.
Fitzrock	Advice Needed - I have a female friend who visits from another city and wants to hang out. She only wants to hang out as friends. What could I do to make the outcome different next time she visits? | [removed]
Fitzrock	I will try it and tell you the outcome.
Fitzrock	Thank you and all the best!
Fitzrock	I was simply wondering if anyone has had this issue and the type of lifer lifestyle they've lived with as a result.  I ask genuinely because I honestly don't know what to do....I'm tired of being lonely all the time, but with ED....what's the point. Eventually she'll just leave you for a 'real' man...
Fitzrock	Interesting Response and thank you for your unique perspective. I perhaps should have explained it more.   In the past 8 years I've been to four Urologists, have different lab tests and blood work conducted, all of which indicate normal levels of testosterone, cholesterol, no diabetes, etc. All of them have prescribed Cialis and Viagra as a solution.  As for me, I'm not overweight, I go to the gym (not much recently but I'll be signing up soon once more) and I run in several 5Ks.  I do have high blood pressure though.
Fitzrock	Awesome. Sky's the limit!
Fitzrock	Thank you for your reply but I'm afraid this isn't the issue. It's the same with or without porn
Fitzrock	Erections are weak and even if it does manage to occur, it's not for very long at all (I mean seconds).   It's a sad reality I've been faced with for years.  I haven't dated in a really long time as a result...it gets terribly lonely, depressing even
Fitzrock	Well Done! Keep on Shinning!  Also, the Best way to do this is to find others who've done this EXACT thing before and mirror their models.   Don't Reinvent the Wheel.  Think Pat Flynn - Smart Passive Income and Entrepreneurs on Fire.  All the Very BEST!
Fitzrock	It depends. Imagine Dr. House from the TV Show HOUSE MD. Notoriously bad attitude however when it comes to his job, he's the Best. Do you care more about company culture or getting the job done?
Fitzrock	Greetings and Congratulations on your initiative! I believe two things could greatly improve your site:  1) An animated video explaining how it works, the time it saves, who exactly it's for etc.  2) Actual case studies of people who've used your Service.  How do you plan to generate revenue exactly?
Fitzrock	Focus on one thing. Serving Customers exactly where they are. Either you go to them or get them to come to you.   Test on a small scale, even with Location specific Facebook Ads and see which one converts.  All the very BEST friend!
Fitzrock	I did actually. Cialis does work but it makes my heart race so fast, I don't take it. The Urologists have no idea what's the cause and say I should just be happy that the pill works :(
Fitzrock	Don't mind the naysayers....keep going!
theunsulliedd	My time is coming | Everyday I wake up and I feel my clock winding down. I can feel my time coming soon. I don't know how but I'll die soon. I just know it and I've accepted it. I've tried for years to get better and honestly I just see a point anymore. Time after time I just get disappointed and I'm tired of this shit man. Everyday I day dream about someone killing me in various ways and it lasts all day.....I can't wait to die soon. 
theunsulliedd	Death | The chances of me killing myself increases everyday I open my eyes. "The bells are getting louder" 
theunsulliedd	Lost all hope | Any hope I have for a better future is all gone. Every time I try and better my life everything just falls apart. It's been this way for years and I see no way out. I've tried to kill myself multiple times but I'm such a fuck up I can't even do that right. I go to therapy and taking medication but everyday I wake up feeling so shitty. At nights I cry until I fall asleep. I believe that not everyone can be saved and I also believe I'm one of those people. I just need someone or something to end this nightmare for me. 
theunsulliedd	I don't know about that. I just want to stop trying. 
theunsulliedd	Same. I try and try and it just leads to me being disappointed. 
theunsulliedd	No. My life has no value. 
theunsulliedd	I used to. But over time it just got worse and worse. This depression has been with me for years and I don't see it ever going away. So what's the point. 
theunsulliedd	Well what about how I feel? I don't want to be here anymore. I have no reason to be here anymore. 
theunsulliedd	Suicide in a few weeks | When I go away to college I'm going to take my own life. I find that when I go away I'll have more opportunities to do it and I'll be away from home so no one can save me or try and stop me. Done with this life. More like hell. 
theunsulliedd	Dead | In due time I will kill myself. I will just have to wait until I have the tools to do so. 
ausername-	Just turned 28. | Sitting in the room of my parents' basement. I don't do much. I have one real friend, I work part time for barely more than minimum wage. I don't drive, I don't have a cell phone, I'm in awful shape. I've never been kissed by a girl.  I'm almost 30 and I haven't even begun doing what most people start doing in their teenage years. It's like I've been asleep for 14 years.  It feels like that, most of the time. Like you've just woke up from too long asleep. Stiff in every joint, feeling real groggy. Lethargic.  I've been suicidal daily for most of the last 7 or so years. Not in that I'd actually think about doing it - that's only happened once or twice, in a panic, thinking I was about to be homeless - just the ideas keep popping into my head, "I wish I was dead," "I wish I weren't alive," "wouldn't it be easy if I just didn't exist?"  I don't want to feel this way anymore, but it seems like so much to even start trying to make those feelings go away. I'm doing little bits and pieces but it hasn't been long enough to tell a real difference, I guess. Exercising more. Decided yesterday to eat a bit better, too. Picked up a few more hours at work. I'm not sure what for, what it'll all amount to. What anything will ever amount to.
ausername-	I don't really enjoy much, honestly. I had a bad gaming habit that ate up a lot of my time and didn't make me very happy - in fact, it made me quite miserable - for a **lot** of years. I've been gaming less. Probably about 2 hours a day, some days I don't game at all (I didn't play a single game yesterday!). 2 hours is probably a lot to some people, but I played for in excess of 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year, for over 10 years, so it's a pretty dramatic difference.  I've been learning. Mostly about history. A little bit about music theory. I've been reading, tepidly. Learning is nice. I like listening to people talk about interesting things.  Days seem longer without that great, big void of gaming to just pour myself into. But less stressful, too. I get overwhelmed with anxiety, sometimes, but long walks can help me settle down those fits. I'm restless often. There's a lot I'd like to do - I don't even know *what* exactly, I'm just certain there's something.
ausername-	Thanks, you made me smile, too. I hope you have a lovely day and the best of luck, too. :)
ausername-	I relate to feeling like nobody will ever want me to a pretty large degree.  I'm socially awkward, painfully so, and without a license or an education or any money, it's hard to believe anybody would be interested in me. Even when people express interest in me, I kind of blow it off because I'm oh-so-sure they wouldn't be if they knew more about me.  I've also got so much emotional baggage I'd feel kind of shitty getting into a relationship with someone, I feel like that's just too much responsibility to put on someone. I have a mental illness and it makes living with me or even just being close to me pretty taxing. So I just keep to myself mostly. A majority of my relationships (platonic) are all online where it's kind of easy to just disappear for a few days when you need to be isolated to deal with an episode, or whatever, and nobody really notices or makes a big deal about it.  The shitty dichotomy there is that isolation and delving deep into the internet tends to exacerbate a lot of the issues I'm struggling with - from a lack of motivation, to the lack of social skills and even in terms of dealing with my mental illness.  I've been trying to use it as a tool to benefit me and my life more lately, and limit the more negative impacts, but it's difficult to eliminate those latter ones completely. I've just got to be alright with "making progress," which I think is applicable in all aspects of life. Rome wasn't built in a day, and all.  I'm sorry you're struggling the way you are, too, by the way, and I hope you manage to find a way out. One that leads to a happier and more fulfilling life.
ausername-	Honestly it sounds like it might be a pretty good idea to actually try taking a class locally. I do everything online. I have crippling social anxiety - I mean that literally, it's crippling. The only way I'm going to get better at it is by interacting with people more often, but even just the idea makes my skin crawl.  I want to do more with music. Music's been an enormous part of my life, as a listener, and I'd like to play and ultimately create music. It's hard to keep motivated without any real direction, that's something that classes would likely help, but they're expensive and I'm poor.  I also want to get into hiking. I live in the north east and there's a lot of beautiful mountains and parks and such all around that would be wonderful to visit. I've been disconnected from nature for a long, long time. Spending all my time locked up in my little dungeon. I used to go out in nature a lot as a child, in summer camps and the like, and it's something I'd like to get into.  I'm in physical therapy now to fix some muscle imbalances that were causing me some issues. Maybe by this time next year I'll be able to hike mountains.
ausername-	It sounds like some of these people are being really insensitive, but I wouldn't be surprised if a few of them actually had been dealing with these issues.  I've been joking about some stuff I've been struggling with openly lately. It feels really good to be able to laugh about something like that. It never stops biting, but you can at least blunt its' teeth a bit, you know?
ausername-	Thank you for your kind words.
ausername-	My dog might not be doing well. | He's turning 15 soon. He's on special medication for his joints and a special diet for his kidneys. The vet warned us that if he starts losing control of his bodily functions it's a sign that his organs might not be able to hold up any longer, and in the past 2 days he's had 3 or 4 accidents. He'd had probably 5 or fewer since he was first trained all those years ago, so it's a pretty big cause for concern.  I really love my dog and I'm upset to see him unwell and the thought of losing him is really quite terrifying to me. I've lost pets before, small hamsters and such, but that was a long time ago and it isn't quite the same. I've had this dog since I was a child, he's my friend, I love this animal.
ausername-	Never had a proper test, though I'd settle with "quite bright."  I've been creative for as long as I can remember. I used to run around with a little clipboard writing stories when I was 5 or 6 or so, until my father took it away for whatever reason.  I was an absurdly awful student. School bored me, and I had behavioral issues due to my abusive, traumatic and unstable home life. Despite never putting much effort into my works or paying attention much in class, any written assignment I'd do very well on, simply due to being able to write well naturally. I'd even win some small recognition for best written assignments on occasion.  I stopped being creative for a long time as a teenager. I got into poetry in my early teens but stopped pretty quickly, stopped most of my creative writing in general, and didn't get back into it for a long time, or at least it seemed like a long time back then.  In my early 20s I decided to start writing again. I still write. Most of it's awful, but you asked if we were creative, not particularly good ;)  I'd also make the distinction between creativity in terms of... Creating artistic works, which is what many people think of when you say something like 'creativity,' and *creative thinking*, which would be more akin to abstract thinking, coming up with different solutions to problems or extrapolating different conclusions from available information than other people. I fit strongly into the latter category, as well, which... I'm not sure whether there's a strong correlation between the two or not? It wouldn't particularly shock me either way, but it's still a distinction worth making, I think.
ausername-	I used to. Took a lot of years to grow out of. Sometimes I sink into a spiral of bitterness and jadedness and fall into old habits. It's easy to succumb to the temptation, but I also know it's just not true.  Basically, for me, I thought I was oh-so-much-smarter than everybody else, and I thought being oh-so-much-smarter than everybody else was a terribly big deal. I looked down on other people who weren't oh-so-much-smarter than everybody else for not being so, and I looked down on other people who didn't value being oh-so-much-smarter than everybody else as much as I did.  I had a realization, one day, that if I weren't as smart as I was (which wasn't as much as I once thought I was, mind you), then being smart wouldn't be particularly important to me.  I wasn't physically strong, and being physically strong wasn't very important to me. I wasn't particularly good at talking to people, and while that one was maybe a little bit *more* important to me than most things I wasn't good at, it also wasn't a particularly big deal to me, either. (That one's a bit funny, honestly, I think I blamed *everybody else* for *my* shitty social skills; 'why don't these people treat me better? why don't these people understand?' when I was unlikable and not particularly good at expressing myself)  We tend to value our strengths because they're things that we're good at. We see the benefits of these strengths because we're strong in that capacity. We tend to undervalue our weaknesses because we manage capably despite them. I think it's important to understand that for all the individual things that make you feel better than all these other people, they're managing just fine without them. You'd manage fine without all these things you were oh-so-much-better than everybody else at, and those things wouldn't be nearly as important to you if you weren't so strong in those ways.  It's refreshing to hear that you like yourself, especially when it's easy to fall into a spiral of self loathing when you're depressed, I just hope it isn't necessarily at the expense of others.  You should love yourself for who you are, independent of others. You don't need to compare yourself to everyone else, or anyone else, you don't *need* to be better than them. I personally found a lot of solace in realizing that I *wasn't*, that I was *just like* everybody else. You're a lot less isolated when you climb down from your high horse.
ausername-	People who need to find different reasons to look down on other people are usually insecure people, and it's pretty common for high schoolers to feel insecure. A lot of people grow out of this, but some people don't. You'll always have shallow, insecure people in your life, there's just a few fewer as time goes on, and it gets a bit easier to deal with them.  I know it's hard, but try not to worry what others think about you too much. Definitely try not to dwell on the individual things people think poorly about you for.  This might seem a bit back handed but I hope you don't take it that way - but, if it weren't for all the things they currently look down on you for, they'd just find something else to. It's not actually about you being flawed in any way, it's about their own inadequacies and their needs to project them.  I actually didn't get bullied too much in high school despite me being a really 'easy target' in a **lot** of ways. I've *always* been *weird*. I have weird interests, I act in weird ways, I talk weird and think weird things. All these things are really easy for other kids to make fun of, and they did, for a bit. And I didn't care. It didn't bother me, because I knew there was nothing wrong with me, and often times something wrong with them.  And they stopped.  It's not worth their time or effort to bully you if you don't give them the reaction they're seeking. The reaction their seeking is making you feel bad, so they can feel powerful, so they can feel better. If you rise above it, they can't feel powerful over you, they can't feel better than you, so they have to just move on.    I'm sorry you're struggling like this, you're not wrong that it's unacceptable and awful, and I sincerely hope you manage to make it through this, and that it doesn't last much longer. I hope you understand that there's nothing wrong with who you are, and that it says much more about anybody who would *want* you to feel that way than it does about you, no matter what they say about it.
ausername-	Anyone else wonder what it's like to be a people? | Nobody treats me like one.
ausername-	I don't really smile, I just wear one sometimes. | I've been a bit of a moody nightmare at work for a while, I guess. I've been making a conscious attempt at being more, like, energetic, or whatever. It's trying.  I just got home. It's been going well for a few weeks but I kind of just feel hollow right now. Drained. Empty. I don't even feel bad, not *really*, I kind of just don't feel anything. I don't even *want* to feel anything. I'm just existing.
ausername-	[Check this out, I watched it the other night and it was pretty eye opening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc)
ausername-	People been calling me "chill" for years, I ain't chill I just don't wanna be alive. | 
ausername-	I make "jokes" about not wanting to do anything, about only enjoying sitting, sleeping, etc., and I've been easing into joking about not wanting to live. Don't think most people take me too seriously, but a few people know I'm being pretty honest about it all.
ausername-	Yeah that's a pretty powerful realization; once you realize you no longer have to be here, every day you stay you're actively making a choice to live.  I grew up in a hyper controlling environment where I had just about no control over my life, made no choices whatsoever, and so there were some pretty strong feelings with the realization that every single day I'm alive, I'm making that choice, by and for myself, and that there's nobody else in the world who can make *that* choice for me.
ausername-	Yeah, I'm pretty aloof so people typically tend to think I don't really give a shit, it really surprises them when I outwardly express kindness or whatever, but I *do* care about just about everyone around me.
ausername-	For me it's disgust. I'm disgusted with everyone and everything and every day of my life. I keep it to myself. I put on this face for everybody else. Nobody really knows me. They all think I'm funny and silly - sometimes people think I'm a little smart but I keep *that* to myself, now, too.  Whenever I used to be open about myself, who I was, how I felt, even what I was interested in, they'd get frustrated. I'd be 'too sad' if I talked about how I felt about anything, or even just in the moment, what was going on in my mind or in my life or whatever, and if I ever started talking about something I was interested in their eyes would just glaze over and the incessant droning of my voice, on and on, would be lost on them.  So I put on this dumb face. I make these dumb jokes and sometimes I can even manage this dumb energy. I'm a very sarcastic person, so I guess being "sarcastically happy" isn't too much of a stretch for me, I just have to be really subtle about it so nobody catches on.
ausername-	I was like that for a long time. I still complain about things, in a big, dramatic, exaggerated manner, but I just don't really care about most things enough to get really mad about them anymore.  Often times when I feel that little bit in the back of my head nagging that I should be upset with something, I just kind of settle on the fact that I'm just too fucking exhausted to deal with those emotions.
ausername-	Feeling this pretty hard. Ever since I was a teen I felt like I was obsessing over people in my proximity just to have someone/something nice to think about amidst my terrible life.  I'm turning 28 in a few weeks and have never had a proper girl friend. I had a few "things" with some girls but those were all mistakes, pretty big ones, too. Never had someone really be serious about me in any capacity.  Pretty rough.
ausername-	my family cancelled plans without telling me today | one person was supposed to pick me up to take me to a cookout at another persons house.  person 1 ignored me asking what time to be ready all day starting since last night, after i sat around for hours waiting for them to get back to me i annoyedly called person 2 who simply said, "i decided we weren't doing that today." nobody told me. i hung up and took a nap. i usually feel better after waking up, this time i didn't.
ausername-	I wish I could see the best in people, but it's hard to after being hurt so many times. | I tend to expect the worst from people, and this has a lot of really awful impacts on my life. From preventing me from really ever reaching out or even putting myself "out there" at all in any capacity to the way it impacts my mental state on a day to day basis; if you're always expecting, and seeing, the worst in people, you're probably going to be rather glum all the time.  I wish I could see the best in people, I wish I could be optimistic to the point of naivety. I know there're times when I'm "right," and times where, if I were more naive, and just assumed the best in people, I'd be "wrong," but... I'm not quite so sure I'm "right" more times in assuming the worst than I'm "wrong" in doing so, or that I'm "right" more times as I am than I would be if I were more naively optimistic, but I don't even think that matters. I think that it'd be worth it just to be able to be more enthusiastic and optimistic in general.  I wish I could be like Chris Traeger from Parks and Recreation.
ausername-	I was just thinking about this not even 20 minutes ago. I was thinking, "How would somebody who says 'don't use a permanent solution' react if they were confronted with the fact that it's, sometimes, a very permanent problem."  I don't know.  It seems like your current treatment plan isn't really working - have you tried alternatives? Maybe there's another treatment option out there that might work better for you?  I sincerely hope your situation changes for the better. I'm sorry you've had to live through what you've had to live through and I sincerely hope you get to experience something better.
ausername-	I never fucked with heroin.  Lot of people I know did.
ausername-	I feel like even if all my problems "disappeared," which they won't and can't, I still wouldn't be happy. | I feel like I was shattered at birth. I have distinct memories of trauma, neglect and abuse starting from a very early age - my first memories of abuse start at around 2 or 3 - and they didn't really ever stop. It's certainly less prevalent now that I'm much older than when I was younger, but, man, even into my later teen years, the turbulence was astonishing.  It's like, all those shards I was, even at birth, they've just been broken up  and broken up and broken up and broken up, and trying to get "better" would be like trying to pick them all up and organize them and stick them together, and it wouldn't even matter, because so much would be missing, that even if you stuck all the bits you could find and organize together, and smooth them all out all pretty, so much would still be missing, or malformed, that I wouldn't even resemble a normal, or happy, or healthy human being.  I don't even feel like a human being at all.  I feel like our outlooks and perspectives on and of life are like a painting, if your palette is only dark colors, you can't ever paint it bright.
ausername-	Me too, it's awful. It sours just about everything, and nobody fucking understands. "You're too young to be in that much pain," they say, annoyedly. Oh, sorry, is my reaction to my fucking medical condition inconveniencing you in some superficial manner?
ausername-	Man, this was hard hitting. I was abused, too, and I can't stand being objectified. Even positive attention makes me extremely uncomfortable, I can't really imagine how shitty it must be to regularly have people dump on you when you're just trying to do your job.  Honestly, I know that you *shouldn't* have to deal with this kind of shit, that it's not really your fault and that it's messed up, but maybe you should try to find a better job, one where you won't be judged or demeaned regularly? It would make it easier to continue building yourself up.  Good job on losing all that weight, by the way. It must be extra hard working at a pizza place where you have such easy access to such bad food. Keep up your pursuit of physical health - being more fit and physically active has a huge impact on your mental well being.  I wish you all the best.
ausername-	I feel like a suicide that hasn't happened yet. | 
ausername-	This is just my personal, unsubstantiated view, but I think most of these people who project their negativity on to women to such a large degree that they literally dehumanize all of them are pretty significantly mentally ill. I feel like there's just *got* to be some underlying disconnection from reality if you're really capable of operating under the assumption that "all women are life sucking leeches who only want men who are really tall, have perfect teeth,  a lot of money, big muscles and drive nice cars." It's pretty much empirically untrue. It's not even a point you need to *research*, you can just look around with your eyes. Anywhere. Everywhere. I really would advise not getting too worked up about the spiteful delusions of the hateful few.  Nothing they have to say can be of any value to you, even if they refer to you directly, they're not looking at you, just their distorted view of you. As for wanting to help them, that's a noble thought, but in my long experience of trying to help people who weren't actively trying to help themselves already, it typically doesn't go anywhere. Not even just strangers, who are typically even less open to that sort of thing, but close personal friends, too. Life's a process and we all go through it in our own way.
ausername-	It takes a lot of self awareness to accept that your struggles with other people often times are reflections of issues you're having interacting with other people. It can be very challenging to acknowledge that, and to approach changing it.  This isn't something that just happens from men to women about romantic (or, oh God, purely sexual) relationships. It's something most of us experience in a variety of different ways. It's so much easier to just project all these issues you're having on everyone around you. It makes you feel safe and secure, it's really tempting to just say, "I know that I'm a great guy, all these girls are just too blind to see it." In a lot of ways, I'm sure it's true, it can be very hard to express all the things about yourself that make you a valuable person, and I truly and honestly believe that we all have aspects that make us valuable people, but that's not really the whole story. We just like to remain willfully ignorant, I suppose.  I hope you don't take their projections to heart. Just try to identify that it's a person who is suffering, but isn't really ready to address the real reason why they're suffering. They'll get there, some day, at least *most* of us do.
ausername-	Things typically don't "get" better, unless you've got some oppressive force in your life pushing you down that somehow resolves itself, which... Does happen, but it's not really "common."  When people say things "get better," they mostly mean to say, "you make things better." Some of it comes with developing better coping mechanisms which lets you start to actually rebuild your life, other times it can involve seeking help and starting there, sometimes we can just get lucky and find good people who really want to help us.  The most effective way to have things "get better" is to play an active role in improving your self, your situation, and your life in general. It's hard, impossibly hard, especially if you don't have a solid support group or lack the resources to seek help - two things which, I think, are true for quite a lot of us.  But it *does* happen and it *is* possible.
ausername-	I'm sure even if you died from something "more natural" than suicide, it'd still break your family's hearts, it'd still leave them shattered.  It sounds like you're not getting the appreciation or love or affection that you desire, and that's tragic - but there are much better ways to get that than to be dying, you know? I really hope you meet some better people who make you feel a lot better than the lot you've got in your life.  Maybe try meeting new people? I know it's hard, and it seems pointless, but you might really find someone who appreciates you and is thoroughly happy to have you in your life. That's what, at a glance, it seems like you're missing the most.  In any case, I'm sorry you're struggling the way you are and I sincerely hope you feel better soon. (:
ausername-	I got ousted from a very close knit group of friends - they were a major part of my life for several years, I'm talking spending 12-15 hours a day with these people every day for a few years.  I had some pretty serious issues for a long while after - like a year, I just never felt okay at all. I'm mostly over it, at least in the day to day, but I'm probably never gunna be able to trust anybody the same way again. Never gunna value friendship or relationships the same way, either. The closest ones I've ever experienced were just always so frail.  I'm sorry that you're still dealing with the immediate consequences - I hope you feel better soon. You can hit me up if you ever need someone to talk to about it.
ausername-	That's so awful I'm so sorry to hear that happened to you.  I don't know what kind of a sick person thinks it's okay to kill an animal like that.
ausername-	Nobody's ever loved me, and I don't think anybody ever will. | I came from a broken home. Neglect, abuse, trauma - you name it, I lived it. I never felt loved - most of the time, I felt like my family resented me. I still do, more often than not.  I don't bother trying to meet people. Not romantically - not for a lot of reasons - and not even for friendship, really. I've been discarded by just about everybody I've ever known. Easily so.  I know that I'm not perfect - I know that I'm far from it. I know I've got bad bits about me, issues that are difficult to understand, and to deal with, but... I don't feel as though I should be so easily thrown away as I've always been. But I am.  And that's okay, I guess. I try not to fall into the trap of hate, or resentment, because all it is is a burden - even when it's justified, which I don't really think it is, most of the time. It's okay for people to not find me appealing, or attractive, or interesting, or valuable. I can't really blame people for the way they feel, or assess value, or whatever, but that doesn't really stop it from hurting.  I feel like I'm probably always going to be alone. My own family couldn't help but hate me, why would I expect anybody else not to. Nobody I've ever known has found much value in me, except what they could get out of me, and so why should I expect anything different.  I just want to be alright with being alone.
ausername-	Sex isn't nearly as important as you think it is.  I'm almost 28, I'm a virgin, and it doesn't bother me one bit. It's only ever awkward when it comes up in conversation with someone who doesn't know - which isn't particularly often.  Sex is just like anything else in this world. It's as important as you make it out to be. Sure, we've got media and advertising bombarding us with sexual imagery and ideation constantly, we've got our peers constantly talking about it - how great it is, how important it is - but in my experience, everything I've been told is great and important, everything I've been assured will change my life completely, radically alter my world view and personality, it hasn't. It's all just experiences and how we frame them in our minds. Whether it's been alcohol, or marijuana, or drugs, or anything, it's never been anything other than a moment and the subsequent memories.  You choose what's important to you, you choose how important it is, and the impact it has on your life. Just because everyone around you and all the marketing and advertising and media tells you it's this great, big, important thing doesn't mean it is. It isn't. It's just a chemical reaction - an electrical impulse - that starts in your brain, runs down your spine, and ends at the tip of your end.
ausername-	I used to think about this a lot. I actually used to write about it, about the only reason anybody'd be sad was because of how sudden it'd be, it'd be a more selfish form of being upset - like it'd be a reminder of their own mortality and the frailty of life, that it'd impose thoughts of the temporary nature of living upon them when they otherwise wouldn't have to grapple with those ideas for a while longer.  And all the people who would miss the "idea of me," but who have no idea who I really am, who make no efforts to get to know me, who make no efforts to do anything with me, or keep me in their life, other than when circumstance dictates.  I used to write about how I wish I could just fade away, faint and slow, like a shadow with ever more light creeping in. No one would notice, as long as it weren't sudden, since no one really seems to care whether I'm in their lives or not anyway.
ausername-	Wow you must've been a few pages deep this is a pretty old post haha.  [One of my favorite songs](https://youtu.be/nabO_UXb6MM) has a line that stuck with me, sent chills down my spine, the first time I'd heard it (in several years);  "A little less than a human being,  a little less than a happy high,  a little less than a suicide,  the only things that you've really tried"  I've tried talking to a few people about how I feel like I'm less than a human, like there's core fundamental aspects of the human experience that I've just missed out on, that I'm incapable of really relating to or experiencing, but they never really understood what I meant. They thought I was being artsy, speaking metaphorically, because, admittedly, I do do that a lot, but I wasn't. I literally do not feel like I'm a human being. I feel like I'm something different. Something less.
ausername-	I appreciate it, really, I do.  I didn't mean to seem so stuck on romantic relationships, if I came off that way. It would be nice to have one, but... I don't dwell on it a lot.  I never felt close to my family. They've always resented me. I was neglected and abused as a child. I don't blame them, per say - things were difficult for all of us, and I don't hate them, but that doesn't change the fact that there are consequences to the things that I suffered, that I still suffer. They're difficult to deal with.  I've also never really had many friends. I valued friendship greatly when I was younger, but things've happened. I've been forgotten and discarded more often than I'd like to mention. Even when I had been part of a group, it always felt like everyone was closer to each other than they were to me. A feeling that ultimately always proved to be true. Most of my groups of friends are all still in contact with each other, friends with each other. None of them are friends with me.  Romantically, I've never really had a girlfriend. I've had, well... Things. Experiences, whatever. Mistakes, probably, haha. But not many, with much time between. I could've had more, I'm sure. I'm alright looking, I'm funny, and all that, and even though I'm painfully awkward around people a lot of the time, I've had girls be interested in me. It's just, aside from being awkward and scary for the few times I've actually been interested in it, I'm just not interested in it all that often. It's very infrequent that I dwell on that.  It's just that, the idea that nobody's ever really loved me, and it doesn't really seem that anybody ever will, it weighs on me sometimes. Not all the time - most of the time, even, I'm good. It's just, those few moments in the small of night, where isolation and loneliness manage to get to me, it's quite intense and not the easiest thing to deal with. It's on my mind often, even if not all the time.
ausername-	I've felt like I've been on auto pilot since I was like 12, just cruising through the last decade and a half. I feel like I'm less than a person, like I'm just an amalgamation of apathy and a lack of ambition outwardly resembling a person.  I've still got a youthful face, people still mistake me for someone much younger than I am, but I'm noticing signs of aging. It's sort of strange to think that I haven't felt alive in more years than all the years I felt "alive." It's sort of strange to think that I'm sort of at the apex of when you're supposed to feel the most "alive," that it's all supposed to go down hill from here, but I didn't really do much for any of those years at all, and I look down and don't see anywhere else to go.  I've been timidly taking steps toward trying to become more of a person. Taking better care of myself, but nothing ambitious, and I'm quite sure it won't last. It never does.
ausername-	Thanks for saying that! Have a lovely day and many more after.
ausername-	I'm happy that you realized that this person clearly didn't care about you or your well being enough to maintain a relationship with them and you promptly moved on.  I don't know you, and I probably never will, but I want you to know that I'm happy for you and proud of you, and that I admire your bravery for making a decision that many of us struggle with - that you took the initiative to take care of yourself in a way that you really needed to.  You'll meet someone better someday. Hopefully some day soon. [:
ausername-	I don't want to do anything. I'd say I wanted to die, but I don't even want that, there's just a complete and total lack of desire for anything at all. | I just fester and exist. Marginally.
ausername-	Almost 30 here. Clearly been through more shit than I'd seen by 17, but just more of the same. If you've seen an hour of a movie that's going no where, you don't need to see the second hour of it to have a good idea what it's like and about.  I think only a shitty adult will dismiss the struggles of someone younger. I've noticed a few co workers (that's the only time I ever really see younger people) younger than me struggling with depression and I've only ever been empathetic toward them and wanted to help them understand that it's okay to feel the way that they're feeling and that there's help out there, and people who care, even if it doesn't seem like it (I'm notoriously aloof at work, but I genuinely do care about just about everybody around me, all the time).  I hope your situation changes for the better. Try to find good, decent people out there. There are people who will care. Dismiss the ignorant opinions of the self centered people who will try to make you feel marginalized - they're the ones with issues if they've got to make your struggles about them. Sometimes it can feel like everybody's like that, but trust me when I say they're not, and just finding a few decent people can make all the difference in the world.
ausername-	I've got quite a lot of unsubstantiated thoughts about our society and all that, but most people aren't very interested in hearing about it. Sometimes I feel like a crazy person when I'm talking to people about it, their eyes kind of glaze over and it's hard to tell whether I have real, valid points or it's all just delusions subsequent of my mental illnesses. It's probably a bit of both. Regardless, I don't really have the motivation, or wherewithal, to take an active role in changing much of anything - even all the bits of my life that I am resentful toward. I mostly just make observations, and keep them to myself, stewing in isolation.
ausername-	Have a crush on a girl for the first time in a long time. | It's probably been years since I've actually felt anything resembling this. I made her laugh and she smiled at me yesterday and it felt like I was melting away. I had a big stupid grin for a few minutes after.  I'm a nervous wreck and I can't even talk to her directly, but I make her laugh when we're around a few other people. Maybe someday I'll be able to actually say more than three words to the girl, who knows.  I mentioned it to a friend, he found out she has a boyfriend. Lucky guy. Didn't bother me, I'm just glad to actually feel something positive for a change.
ausername-	"I will never feel safe  I will never feel sane  I will always feel weird inside,  I will always be lame."  -Everclear, Father of Mine  That entire song resonates with me, but that one part sends chills down my spine. It's exactly how I feel. No matter how hard I work, no matter how well I deal with any of my issues, I'm always going to be a vastly different person than everyone else around me because of a few awful events in my childhood. It makes me feel like I'm not a normal human; like I'm not a human.
ausername-	I just make awful jokes all the time because nobody was ever interested in anything I had to say when I honestly expressed myself. | I make a lot of puns. People call them "dad jokes," or whatever. They're usually good for a laugh or two. That's about all I've got to say anymore because people find everything that fascinates me completely uninteresting, or, at least everybody around me does. They find **me** completely uninteresting. I just keep to myself instead of wasting my time wasting everybody else's time.
ausername-	I know that it's not for a good reason that you don't use these things, but it is a good thing not to be using them overall. While it is possibly to have a healthy use pattern with these things, a VAST majority of people don't practice healthy use of social media. Social media affects us negatively in a ton of ways - particularly those of us prone to struggling with depression. From direct ways like showing us a biased toward the positive glimpse at other people's lives, fueling our feelings of jealousy, envy or inadequacy, to making us feel more boring or unsuccessful when we see how busy everyone else is and how, by comparison, boring we are - right down to that sense of loneliness you're alluding to. These social media outlets are highly addictive and they affect us neurologically in profound ways, as well.  It is terrible to be isolated and lonely in general, but walking away from social media tends to compound these things as opposed to helping us limit them. They call it "social media" but it promotes quite a lot of antisocial tendencies.
ausername-	I lost another friend today. | This was an online friend, those are all I really have.  I've known this person for a long time, nearly 10 years, but we didn't talk for quite a few years. We ran into each other and started talking again about 8 or so months ago. Earlier this month he stopped responding to me suddenly, pretty much in the middle of a conversation. So once or twice a week since then I'd message him, today he responded.  I asked him why he was upset with me, he said he wasn't. I asked if we were still friends, he said "sure I guess." I asked what he meant by that and he said "can online people even be real friends?" which was pretty weird.  I forget how this came up but he accused me of not talking to him since I stopped playing the game that we both played together. I pointed out he was the one who stopped talking to me and that I persistently tried to keep in contact to which he said "are you on drugs". I told him to stop gas lighting me, he told me to stop accusing him of shit he wasn't doing, so I went through and took screenshots of several points in our message history where I'd message him once every couple of days and him not responding, then the part where he'd said 5 minutes prior that I never messaged him anymore. He told me I needed to learn more a bout how people think, or something absurd like that, and that it was wrong to confront people about abusive behavior patterns (my words, not his, obviously).  He essentially said it was more wrong for me to confront him about how his abusive behavior affected me because he "didn't want to hear" my "bitching and moaning" than for him to exhibit abusive behavior patterns (I didn't use those words until just about the end of the conversation), then he threatened to block me if I kept talking about it, to which I replied with "I don't give a fuck" because he made it pretty obvious he didn't care about or respect me as a person and I don't really have any interest in interacting with people on their terms, whenever and however it's convenient to them. And so he blocked me.  The funny thing is prior to him doing this, he was about one of 3 or 4 people in my life who hasn't been explicitly abusive toward me.
ausername-	I do agree, but I'm not likely going to meet anybody else particularly soon. I've been pretty antisocial for a while and so I don't really try to meet new people. I'd rather be okay with being alone rather than try to find people who "stick," because I haven't had very much luck with the latter in quite a lot of time trying.  Some day I'll have a place of my own and a nice little dog and that's about all I really want.
ausername-	It's been so long since I've wanted to live I honestly can't remember if I ever actually did, or if the idea of not simply hadn't occurred to me yet. | 
ausername-	So, I've never really talked about this before, but I kind of want to tonight. | My mother is chronically mentally ill. She's been in and out of mental institutions for all of my life, starting when I was very young. She left my father when I was 3 or 4, and he ultimately got custody, but she took my brother and I when she left.  I was very young, but I have pretty vivid memories. I don't know whether I knew something wasn't right right away or not, but I do know that it wasn't too long until I did know. She had swept my brother and I up in a hurry, I didn't know what was going on. She plopped me in the back seat of the car, and my brother in the passenger seat (he's almost 5 years older than me), and we were off.  I didn't recognize the place we went to. It was some bar, or diner, or pub, or something. I'm still not sure. I know I didn't know where it was, and I know that she was in there for a long time, and I know I didn't know what was going on. I remember being scared, angry, and very upset. Eventually I decided I needed to go and see her and find out what was going on, and I tried to get out of the car, but my brother stopped me, physically. I wonder whether he knew what was going on.  I only have a few memories of living with her. It might've been for a few months, or maybe it was a few weeks, I'm not sure. I know that I knew from a very young age that she was mentally ill, and I thought I knew what that meant. To me, it was just life, I didn't feel like I was any different than any other kid, but in hindsight it affected me pretty dramatically.  My life never really got any better. It still isn't. I've been going through some shit lately with my family. I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it isn't going to be good. I'm not okay, and I don't think I'll ever be okay. I know I've never been okay before, ever since my very first memories.
ausername-	I had a similar reaction. I was strange in a lot of different ways for a lot of different reasons, but looking back, a lot of particular behaviors are 100% a reaction to my sexual abuse, and possibly another incident, as well.
ausername-	As time's gone on I've slowly given up on hopes of being happy, feeling better, etc. The more I simply accept that my only real desire is to feel "comfortable," the more escaping into an addiction makes sense to me. | I was a pretty heavy drinker for a while when I turned 21 (I was such a prude I waited until it was legal to drink, oh my!) and I decided that if I had to alter my brain with a chemical to have a good time, I was by definition not having a good time. Or to feel better, or whatever. But as I get older and as I've accepted that "being happy," or even just feeling "better," isn't in the cards for me, that distinction I made so long ago seems to matter less and less.
ausername-	i have no idea how i was born into such an awful family of such nasty people | my entire immediate family are just the worst kind of fucking people imaginable. the only decent people in my entire family i've ever met were my father's parents, who both passed away, and his brother's family, who are far away.  my father's just awful. he's the angriest man in the entire world and i don't have the slightest clue why. it feels like he needs and excuse to not be nasty to me rather than the other way around.  my mother and her entire side of the family are just the worst kind of people. my father came from a middle class family. my mother didn't. she's from a pure bred white trash lineage, full of alcoholism, abuse, mental illness and poverty. her first son's a sociopath and i had to grow up with him.  i dont understand why i had to be born into such an awful fucking family. i dont understand why i had to be born at all, but why into such a horrible fucking family. every aspect of each of them is just fucking disgusting.  it used to make me angry, but nowadays i dont even have the energy to be angry anymore. im just fucking disgusted, i've got so much fucking disgust inside me i feel like i couldn't take any more of it, but then, about every day, i manage to find a way to funnel more disgust on in me.  the fucked up thing is im the one who feels like im less than a person, and it's mostly because of these awful monsters and all the abuse and trauma and neglect, and even though it's been a while since the worst of it, i guess, just seeing these people, just knowing that they exist, and that there's so many people out there just like them, it makes me so sick to my stomach i feel like i'm gunna be violently ill.  i sit about 16 hours a day and i thought it was cuz i didn't have the energy not to but i think i just realized why. it's cuz i can't stand it.
ausername-	I can't help but feel a bit envious every time I hear about someone dying. | 
ausername-	"Normal" means "like everybody else." So regardless of whether we're 'right' about how wrong everything is, we're still abnormal for being as such.  You should look up Noam Chomsky on youtube, or look into some of the books he mentions when he talks about wage slavery if you're into reading. It's very enlightening on how the passivity of recent generations is a relatively new phenomenon and how people fought against the 9-5 lifestyle with zeal and fervor as recently as the early 1900s. Pretty eye opening stuff.
ausername-	I think it has less to do with how good people are at hiding it and more to do with how inept most people are at detecting it. I can spot signs of depression a mile away. Obviously not in everybody; I'm sure I've missed out on quite a few, even, but I've spotted it in people everybody else seemed to be missing out on.
ausername-	Yesterday I had a good day, and then I came home. | I spent yesterday with some friends. We went to the zoo and saw some animals, we had breakfast and lunch and drove around and saw some beautiful things and beautiful places and we talked a lot and had a good time. I felt better pretty much all day long than I'd felt for a really long time. And then I came home.  My "family," if you can call them that - it'd be more accurate to describe them as the people who occupy my immediate proximity - always make me feel miserable. Even without trying; in fact, it's mostly the lack of trying. They barely even speak to me; they don't even say hello when I greet them when I see them most of the time. They avoid eye contact with me. They only speak to me if they need me to do something, or to not do something. They act like I'm in their way when I do something as simple as eat. If I ever have to ask them for something, they make it very clear with their body language, and even, often, verbally, that I'm putting them out, irritating or annoying them, something - anything. It's miserable and I can't stand it. They're miserable and I can't stand them.  They're awful hypocrites. They shout to each other; not in anger or arguments, just to speak across the house. Their voices are so loud all the time. They shout into the phone. They play their music and television very loud. This usually doesn't bother me much, I keep headphones on, and it can be pretty annoying when I try to sleep (I can't maintain a persistent sleep pattern so I tend to sleep all kinds of weird hours), but what really annoys me is if they even hear me for a second a single time they'll come knock on my door and complain about it. "I'm not putting up with this again," my father said the last time. It was 8 pm. I dared to enjoy a conversation with a friend.  I want to kill myself every day. Every hour of every day. I've wanted to kill myself every hour of every day for the past 5 or 6 years; there was only a single period of time a few months long when I didn't, two or three years ago, and for the rest of that entire period of time I've though about killing myself every single day. I can't imagine they don't know. It's pretty obvious. I've even been saying it - unconsciously - more and more for the past year or so. Any time my brain goes to some sort of line of thinking I don't really want to be thinking about, which is pretty much all the time, I'll find myself saying, "I don't want to be alive anymore," or "please kill me." To nobody in general, not even meaning to say it, it just happens. I can't imagine they haven't overheard me. I can't imagine it'd come as a shock or a surprise, honestly, I haven't really been hiding it. They just don't care.  I don't understand why, if I'm such a burden, and I clearly am, they don't want to help me get out of here. They seem to hinder me. Often. I just don't understand these people. I'm mentally ill, I guess, but they seem a whole hell of a lot sicker than me. A lot of people do, really.
ausername-	I started a poem I'd like to finish, but I know I won't because I can't finish anything. | I was born a baby upon a great commotion  into a home that would soon be broken  from calm to hell like the rage of the ocean  silence and screams were the ways we'd spoken
ausername-	When I was 23, I thought I'd be dead by 25. I'm getting close to 28 now; I'm still not sure I've made the right choice, if there is such a thing as "right choices," and I still feel like "in another 5 years, I'll probably be gone," but I guess now I've been wrong in saying that more times than I've been right, so who knows.
ausername-	I've resolved to become okay with being alone. I'm not, yet, loneliness still gets to me, but I just don't believe there's anybody out there "for me." I've spent the better part of 30 years looking and have only found disappointment.  If I happen to stumble upon some good people, then, well, that'd be okay, I guess, but I'm not hoping for it. I'm not looking for it. I'm not banking on it or relying on it or anything. I'm going to do my best to be alright on my own, since that's what I've always ended up as, anyway.
ausername-	I insulate myself with music, too, when I actually have to get out of the house. I've always loved music, not just for that reason, but I guess it means a bit more to me than just someone who "loves music" because of that reason, as well.  For a long time it was my goal to fill my life with "good people," people who I enjoyed being around and who enjoyed being around me and impacted and influenced me in a positive manner. I went through some shit; twice in a few years a bunch of really close people (all of them, actually) all abandoned me; discarded me, for no real reason. I took it pretty hard for a while. I don't cry about it anymore, I don't get upset or even angry. I just don't want to have people in my life anymore. I want to become okay with being alone. I'm not okay with it right now, but I want to become okay with it. It seems both more realistic and simply a better alternative for me. I'm simply never going to find a single person who will ever understand me; not for lack of a capacity to on their end, rather simply a lack of desire. I've simply never had anybody be particularly interested in more than the most superficial, skin deep aspects of me.
ausername-	I'm not okay. | 
ausername-	A real man conducts himself in a manner which he chooses despite the opinions or expectations of those around him. It takes courage and confidence to stray from the herd and to stand on your own.
ausername-	Nonconformity is an enduring tradition.
ausername-	My skin crawls when I have to go out in public. I usually leave the house late at night, past midnight, but there's very few places that are open all night around here now. I don't think it's a huge surprised for me, though, I never did well in school. I get really uncomfortable being around people in general; it takes me a long time to "warm up" to people and get comfortable being around them, and even then, I get really self conscious a lot around other people because of my weird mannerisms or all the peculiarities of my personality.  The hardest part is that I always want to be alone because it's so uncomfortable and exhausting being out // around people (I get pretty exhausted mentally if I have to be out of the house for more than an hour or two), but I get so lonely the pain gets to be too much to bear. It's an awful contradiction.
ausername-	I love your metaphor because it seems so accurate. The same way you can go to therapy and deal with some of the immediate and outward consequences of some of the individual issues caused by your child hood, you can pick up that piece of paper and you can smooth it out and make it about as flat as it can be, and it's still a piece of paper the way we're still people. You can still write on it, we can still live our lives - have jobs, meet people, maybe even start a family (though I never will). But on every inch of it there's still remnants - folds and creases and rips and tears - and you can't ever smooth them all out or fix them or make them like they would've been if it hadn't been crumpled up to begin with.  I write a lot, alone at night, and sometimes individual lines stick with me. I had written something along the lines of how I can always change a lot about my situation but I can never change my past, and though I can maybe deal with some of the feelings of shame or inadequacy, I can never change what happened to me. I can never become an unraped boy. That's always what I'll be, no matter what I do, for the rest of my life.
ausername-	A few years ago I told a friend (who I no longer speak with) that I felt like a key that didn't fit into any locks, or a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that looked like it belonged but just wouldn't fit right. I locked myself in my room for a bit over 10 years and barely ever went out; I try to get out more now, but whenever I'm around other people I just feel incredibly weird and uncomfortable. I start to notice all my peculiar little mannerisms, all the goofy stuff I say and do and think about. It's hard for me to just be there around other people. I feel as though it's fundamentally impossible for me to maintain a meaningful connection with a single other human being. Part of that might have to do with just who I am naturally, to some degree, but I think a lot of it has to do with my warped views caused by my childhood; all the awful relationships that I had when I was young, and all the awful things I think and feel about myself.  I've never enjoyed life. I didn't "not" enjoy life when I was very young, but I feel as though I was merely too young and undeveloped to make any distinction. I remember that when I was 13, I was learning about clinical depression in Health class, and I remembered a clear and distinct event that reminded me of it from when I was 11. I'd also remembered when I was maybe 6 or 7 that the school's guidance councilor wanted to talk to me about my home life, but my father told me not to tell them anything. I didn't understand that at the time, but I really wish I didn't listen.
ausername-	Does anybody else wonder what their life would be like had they not suffered years of childhood trauma and abuse? | I was abused as a child. Emotionally and sexually. I don't feel like a victim, or a survivor. I feel like a consequence. Like my entire life has been a series of consequences of both; largely the latter as a specific event, but collectively the former, as well.  I feel like no matter what I do, I'll always be the person who developed in response to these events in my childhood. That, no matter what individual aspects of my current situation I change; where I live, what I do, the manner in which I conduct myself in relation to my environment, I'll always be a direct response to my childhood trauma.
ausername-	I think it's admirable to keep people out of your children's lives who you know would not be good to have in their lives, despite what society and your peers say or think or feel or will judge you for or about. It's an unfortunate circumstance that your side of the family isn't anything resembling what a "family" should be, but it's not unfortunate to keep your children from that. It's important to protect them and it's  admirable to do so.  I think that "family" is and can be real, but just not always, not easily, and not because it "ought" to. It's a lot of work to maintain a family, and a lot of people just don't have it in them to do so, or don't care, and if your family happens to consist of those individuals, then you can't really do anything about that, except for to find a new one and work your hardest to keep that one as far from becoming what the old one you knew was. At least, that's my take on it.  I've gotten in a lot of argument with people over the years about the importance of family. It's just blood. A few shared traits, similar features. These people couldn't be more distant to me than people in Asia or Australia or the other side of the galaxy. We've never been close. I don't know how anybody could muster the audacity to insinuate that they're proximity qualifies them to be anything other than "near," you know? I've had people tell me I'm lying about some of the stuff that happened to me. Tame stuff. Stuff that'd be a 2/10 compared to other things that'd happened to me. Always blows my mind.  I hope the best for you and your family. I'm sure you'll be loads better than the lot you had to survive when you were younger.
ausername-	Not sure what the laws are like in your state but you might have some rights in terms of wrongful termination. IANAL and I know some states have pretty much zero protection whatsoever but this is something you could probably look into. Where I live you can't just be fired outright without a good reason.
ausername-	it kind of sucks to need help you know you're not gunna get before you even bother asking. | when everybody in your life is only reliable at being completely un fucking reliable, it's hard not to drown, even standing on dry land. i don't know how long i've felt this way, i don't even know if i ever didn't, for just about as long as i can remember i just feel helplessly helpless, isolated and alone.
ausername-	I very openly want to kill myself and nobody around me even cares. | I slightly suspect some if not most of them would secretly be relieved if I just went away. I bet most of them would even prefer it, if they were given the option of having it happen in a "not-so-shocking" sort of a way, like if I could just disappear, or never have existed in the first place.  I don't even know why. I know that I have a bit of a flawed personality; I'm not the easiest person to get along with, or whatever, but, I mean, there's fucking murderers and arsonists and evil, awful people who have families and friends and people who love them. And I don't.
ausername-	I don't even really want anything, I just feel like dying all the time. | 
ausername-	sure that'd be fine.
ausername-	I've been suicidal daily for most of the past 6 years. | At least once an hour, every hour, of every day, for the past 6 years, except for a brief period of respite which lasted for maybe 2 or 3 months about 2 years back, the idea of wanting to not be alive has popped into my head; and quite a bit more frequently than that lately. I'm not sure if that's being suicidal or if I'm using the wrong word here. I don't ever really think of actually killing myself; how I'd do it, how it'd affect anybody, or anything like that, rather I just think, "I explicitly want to not be alive."  I almost typed "I explicitly want to not be alive **anymore,"** but that would imply that I ever actually did in the first place. When I was a teenager I was strictly against the idea of suicide. I was morbidly depressed, and I didn't want to be alive, but I saw a distinct difference between not wanting to be alive and wanting to *not be alive.* That distinction meant a lot more to me back then than it does now.  The fact of the matter is, I don't think I've ever actually wanted to be alive. I wasn't as depressed as a child, though there certainly were quite a lot of unnoticed//unaddressed warning signs very early in my life, and even though I thought about death a lot late at night laying sleeplessly in bed; what happened when you died, what happened to those around you when you died, what your life meant before and after having died; it was always about other people and not about me. The idea of me not being alive didn't really occur to me until I was a teenager. I think in order to really want to be alive, you have to have had considered the possibility of you not being alive, rather than simply having taken it for granted.  And for as long as I've considered the fact that I might not have been born, I've sort of resented the fact that I was. For as long as I've considered the fact that I might not have been alive in that particular moment, I almost assuredly would've preferred to have not been. It's been like this for as long as I can remember, and it'll likely be to case for the foreseeable future. I wonder if I'll always feel like this for as long as I live; the idea of ever feeling differently seems pretty foreign to me.  I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get at with all this meandering around. I guess it's sort of just been eating away at me lately and I don't really have anybody to talk to about, well, anything of substance. It's sort of cathartic getting it all off my chest. If you're still reading this, then I'd like to say thank you, and I hope you don't feel like I do, and haven't as long as I have and won't as long as I will if you do.
ausername-	I wrote about some of the stuff in this subreddit before. I've been through a lot and still struggle with a lot.
ausername-	You're forward, aren't you?
ausername-	And around, yeah, probably.
ausername-	All 3 would pertain to my early childhood.
ausername-	Dissimilar in all regards, I guess? What I'm trying to say is I don't think life itself is inherently miserable or depressing, but just about every aspect of mine is. I can't really imagine just one or even a few things that could be changed, either at this point in time, or at any point in my past, that would make me a "happy person," but I acknowledge that there are people out there - a **lot** of people - who don't feel the same way that I do.  If I were completely different in every capacity, I might be happy. There's no one magic bullet solution, I can't just work on one aspect, and realistically expect to not be miserable every hour of every day.
ausername-	I mean, nothing, really. That's sort of why I don't even feel like I'm really living, rather I'm merely just alive.  I suppose I'd rather... Be someone else. In a completely different situation, with a completely different personality. Just absolutely ever aspect of my awful life and my awful personality completely different. That's the only way I imagine I could actually be "happy."  I don't really have any idea what being "happy" is. It's something I've never personally experienced, and I'm not entirely sure many people I've ever known have, either. Everybody around me is so miserably depressed, or, at least it seems that way to me, and it's been that way even since my childhood. Birds of a feather, maybe?
ausername-	If all you do is drift through each day waiting until you finally die, are you even really alive? | 
ausername-	That's well said. I suppose I hadn't thought of it that way since I sincerely do enjoy *some* aspects of my little comfort zone. I guess the worst of it is the loneliness, but that's not isolated to just staying all by myself in my little comfort zone. I always feel alone, even when I'm around other people. There's this sort of fundamental disconnection between them and me, I never feel close to anyone.  I have a lot of little agitants in my life I'd like to be without, but it's not really possible to just stay isolated in your little corner of the world with nothing and no one to bother you. There's this awful dichotomy of yearning to go out and see and do and enjoy more and then wanting to just find solace in peace and quiet and having no disturbances. A lot of what I "want" is contradictory, I guess, but I'd also hazard a guess that all I really "want" is to feel differently, and I have no idea how to do that, so my mind desperately defaults to all sorts of things.
ausername-	Feeling absolutely awful. | I've written out and deleted a half a dozen different things trying to express how I feel just now. I don't know exactly how to express it, all the intricate little aspects of how I feel; but I can tell you that it's awful. I can tell you I would wish I'd never have to feel this way again, if I'd believed in wishes, or I'd wish I didn't have to resign myself to accepting the fact that I most certainly will again, and most likely very soon.  Maybe it wont be exactly the same, but it'll be just as terrible, just as inexpressible, just as difficult to deal with in the moment, and just as detrimental to my overall state of well being.  "Well being". For me, it should likely be "unwell being." That's what I am, for the most part; an unwell being. I cling to all four corners of my minuscule comfort zone as tightly as I can and I leave it as little as I can manage.  There is a part of me that longs to be well, that longs to be healthy, that longs to go out and explore the world and absorb all of life's experiences as I can; but I can't. There's something inside me holding me back. A little monster, dark and small, so long as I keep myself locked up and avoid all the world. Once I step outside of my cozy little corner; once I step outside of *myself*, my little monster starts to grow. Slowly, at first, but steadily as time goes on. Soon it starts to thrash and kick and snarl, clawing and gnawing on every aspect of my life.  And so I don't step outside of my cozy little corner, I don't step outside of myself. I try to keep as quiet as I can, stay as small as I can, so I won't have to fight so it so hard. So I won't have to worry about not being "myself" anymore; despite "myself" being so limited by it. Most of the time I don't mind; I manage to find one way to distract myself, or another, but it gets awfully lonesome here, all by myself, disconnected from everyone around me. Even when I'm with other people, I always feel all alone. It's just me in here; me and my monster, and I guess I'm scared that's how it'll always be.
ausername-	I can't tell what I hate more; everyone around me, or all the awful aspects of my own shitty personality. | 
ausername-	I laugh, and I smile, and it doesn't feel like I'm lying, but I don't entirely feel sincere about it, either... | Even when I feel positive emotions they're always compromised; they're only surface deep. Beneath it all I loathe the contrast to who I really am, how I really feel, and, even when I legitimately feel happy about something, I resent the fact that those moments are too few and fleeting.
ausername-	When I don't think about my problems, I don't really feel pain, but avoiding them all tends to make life seem surreal. | I've been avoiding my issues for a really, really long time now. Some more came up suddenly, and I kind of just put it out of my mind. It wasn't happening in my immediate vicinity, so I just avoided thinking about it. It doesn't hurt that way, but sometimes the realization creeps into my head, "This is your life. What you're doing right now is how you're living your life. What are you doing?"  It's abrupt and pretty awful and difficult to deal with. So, like all of my other problems that are awful and difficult to deal with, I tend to try not to focus on it too much...
ausername-	If you think you should try it, then you probably should try it. I'm honestly under the impression that our mental health awareness, culturally, is very low, and seeking help and getting treatment is unfairly stigmatized when it's something I feel as though every single individual in the world could benefit from.  There are a lot of bad therapists out there. There are a lot of good ones that will be a bad fit for you. The trick is finding someone you're comfortable with, and really *working* at it. It's tough, but rewarding.  I would suggest trying to approach it with an open mind. Mental health care and services have improved dramatically since your mother was a teen. You could start with a psychologist first if you're unsure about diving right in to taking medication; they can refer you to a psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, or someone else who can prescribe medication later if needed. A psychologist is someone who is more interested in how your thoughts work as opposed to a psychiatrist who is more interested in the chemistry of your brain, how certain chemicals affect your mood.  You mentioned cost; are you not insured, or perhaps insured by a plan that doesn't cover mental health services well? In that case, you might want to call around and ask about payment assistance. I know that one of the places I went to for a while worked very hard to provide for the community and had a lot of programs to help people who weren't insured and couldn't afford treatment. I know it's *very* expensive to just try and get treatment without insurance, at least around here.
ausername-	Snowed in. | Not sure how many of you live around here, but there've been some pretty crazy snowstorms the last 2-3 days. A foot or more twice in a row with not enough time to clear the streets in between. Everybody's snowed in and they're all in a tizzy. Not me, though. I feel like I've been emotionally snowed in for over a decade now. Like there's always so much stuff falling on me, enveloping me, and every time I try to wiggle my arms to make some way, more just comes to replace it.  I take comfort in being alone, but loneliness can hurt so bad, sometimes, it's about all you can bare. I don't know if that's ironic, or hypocritical, or what. I guess it kind of doesn't make much sense, but, then, I guess there's a lot in life that doesn't make much sense. All I know is I've never really felt like I was "living," rather all I've ever done was prolong the process of dying. I've been dying since the day I was born, and I guess it never really seemed all that alarming to me, since it's all I've ever really known.
ausername-	So I drank for the first time in a long time not too long ago. I'm a couple drinks a year kinda guy, having brushed shoulders with pretty severe alcoholism in my early 20s I long ago decided that that's not the life for me. So, having had a few drinks, out with some friends, I remember thinking, "This is the first time I've felt 'okay' in months." The time before that involved doing a drug that I've since decided never to do again.  I don't know. It keeps creeping back into my head. How miserable I am all the time. I don't know. I do know that I've been spending a lot of time with some alcoholics, having moved in with some people who drink for hours a day every single day, and I can say with unwavering certainty that that's not something I want to be. That's not something I want to remotely resemble. Alcohol is disgusting and it turns people disgusting.  Don't know what I'm gunna do. Don't know how I'm gunna find happiness or if I ever will, but I do know that I'd rather be miserable and sober than a miserable drunk who thinks he's happy.
ausername-	Yes that's a good point, when you're struggling with mood it makes it very difficult to regulate weight for a variety of reasons. It's harder to start exercising when you're not feeling well, it's easier to maintain poorer eating habits. Eating better and exercising more make it easier to maintain a healthier mindset, too, though.  Getting some help to deal with depression and anxiety would very likely help a lot in a lot of ways. It's kind of hard to understand the depths to which these issues affect *every* aspect of your life. It's a lot more than just the way you feel in any given moment.
ausername-	The only people who claim weight loss is easy have never been obese. I remember reading a story a few years back of a personal trainer who purposefully gained a lot of weight so he could try to understand what it felt like for people to have to then try to lose all that weight. Even as someone who was educated in the proper way to eat and exercise, he said it was probably the hardest thing he'd ever had to do in his entire life. You absolutely shouldn't feel like you're struggling with something that's "easy" by any stretch of the imagination. It's hard. Impossibly hard.  Maybe try baby steps. A lot of the time people tend to try to change a lot of aspects of their lives all at once. They try to start exercising a lot, all the time, while changing their diet a tremendous amount, all at the same time. It's impossible to keep up doing something like that. It's much easier to, say, try to reduce snacking in between meals, first, or reducing how many sweetened drinks you drink in a day. Once you're comfortable with that, maybe try exercising 10 minutes a day once every 2-3 days. Once you're comfortable with that, try another small step.  I know how hard it is to go out when you're unhappy. While it's typically recommended to get out more often (depression is strongly associated with isolation whereas it's harder to remain depressed when you have constant social contact), if it's too hard for you right now, maybe you could try exercising at home, in the privacy of your own room? There's a ton of calisthenics exercises you can do without any equipment. Try checking out beginner body weight routines on youtube or something. :)
ausername-	I don't know. I don't really think so. I barely ever leave the house and kind of prefer it that way.
ausername-	I feel like the nicest thing I can do for anyone is to just leave them alone. | 
ausername-	For me those periods are really brief. People seem to like me a lot for short periods of time but if they spend more time with me, or do so more frequently, they get "turned off" of the idea of being around me really quick. Which is, like, okay, you know? It's normal and healthy and everything to have some "acquaintances," people you enjoy having in your life and being around without ever really elevating it to the next level or getting to be very close with them, and it's okay to BE that person for other people, too, but the issue is... That's all that I have. That's all that I'm really able to have. Any time I try to get closer to someone - anyone - it just... Either blows up, or they just clearly want nothing to do with that. It's really frustrating, because I don't really have all that much interest in having more acquaintances or being an acquaintance. I really want to be close to people and have people be close to me - to really matter to someone, to be impactful on their life, to have someone actually be **excited** to see me, to have me around, to be in their lives, and that's just something that is absolutely, soul crushingly absent from my life.
ausername-	People tend not to want me around. I'm usually the person initiating interactions. Sometimes other people will, but it's usually once in a very blue moon. Once a month or more rarely (for an individual person, not out of everybody I know). I feel like an after thought. A rarely thought of after thought.  Beyond that there's just aspects of my personality I don't really like. Parts of me that aren't particularly admirable. I can justify and rationalize and excuse them all away, pretty convincingly I'm sure, but that doesn't really change the fact that at the end of the day I don't really like who I am or the way I interact with people or any of that at all. I'm not a bad person, or anything, but I'm not a particularly good one, either.
cchristel	My brother tried to kill himself. How can I help? I need advice. | 
cchristel	I’m always nice to him. We are very close. His therapist won’t talk to him until he does out patient care for suicide watch. He only wants to talk to the therapist though, and the therapist is denying him. It’s kind of crazy. Idk what to do for him. 
cchristel	So here’s where it gets crazy. I’ve told him plenty how much I love him. Did it tonight too. He wants to talk to a therapist, but the therapist won’t talk to him until he goes through suicide therapy. He’s supposed to do out patient care for the next month. He won’t do it. The therapist he’s seen won’t talk to him until he does it. Should we find a new therapist? 
cchristel	You could also use google photos. Unlimited high quality storage. 
cchristel	Great suggestions, but we live in different states. So I’m kind of far away. I appreciate you replying though. Thank you! 
cchristel	Definitely sounds like the fillings are high and need to be taken down more. 
cchristel	Is it pain when biting or more constant? You saying your bite feels off and you experiencing pain makes me think the fillings are still high. I’d return and have the bite checked again with articulating paper, and have the high spots taken down. 
cchristel	Looks like a beautiful part of the family right there. You’re always welcome in the US and Green Bay!!!
cchristel	And that his dick gets more business than YouTube. 
cchristel	When was the last time a projection said we were going to go 16-0? 
cchristel	Who said 16-0? Get your negativity out of here. The season hasn't even started yet for the Packers. 
cchristel	Go Warhawks!! Proud alum here. Glad to see that they're going to be there. 
cchristel	No negativity here!
cchristel	There's a guy in Milwaukee that lives near the airport. He painted "Welcome To Cleveland" on the roof of his house to do this exact thing. 
cchristel	While you're over by surly don't forget to check out Lake Monster and Blackstack!
cchristel	Substratum what?
cchristel	I'll confirm Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota
cchristel	I worked at a gas station that wasn't even in the middle of nowhere. I can guarantee you nobody was monitoring anything after we closed. There weren't even cameras outside to monitor. You could pump gas there all night.
cchristel	Do you think it will really help out this team?  Just messin! Thanks for the video.
cchristel	Did you just stutter while typing? Good catch though!
cchristel	Good bot
cchristel	Eminem
cchristel	Oh they will. They're both allies. An attack on them is an attack on America.
cchristel	They won't do anything without the US coming with them.
cchristel	I like stock too but I just switched to Nova
cchristel	I know it gets posted a lot, but show me your home screen! I love the inspiration from these posts. | [removed]
cchristel	Very scary. And you're welcome.
cchristel	They do have a defense system, just not one that was able to intercept a missile as high as this one.
cchristel	I would assume it just falls into the ocean and doesn't detonate. I honestly don't know though.
cchristel	They sent out an alert to all cell phones I believe. They had their air raid sirens, and tv alrets as well. I'm not sure how many countries have this set up. I know the US does. Past that I'm not sure.
cchristel	I believe they did, but if there is a war at any point I highly doubt they would back NK.
cchristel	Adhell got pulled from the Play Store and GitHub. Some people uploaded the APK elsewhere, but it won't be updated anymore. Not sure how that will change how it works or not though.
cchristel	Good bot
cchristel	Be more social if possible. It's likely that any friends you have also have other friends you haven't met yet. Other than that it's all about being outgoing. Any new people that have joined our "group" usually introduced themselves or make the first move.
cchristel	I've had it for about 4 years now, and it has worked great for my fiancé and I. I have very few complaints. 
cchristel	Why would he be drinking beer and lifeguarding?
cchristel	Lucky!
cchristel	I wasn’t able to either. Were you on LTE?
cchristel	I was able to walk in and buy them at a Target like a week ago. Might be worth it to check that out as well for some people! 
cchristel	Lol
cchristel	Will do! 
cchristel	No problem! Definitely looking forward to wk 1 vs you guys! We usually go to Billy's on Grand if we aren't at a friends place. It's a nice bar to watch the game. Good luck with the move and everything! 
cchristel	I tried some Google magic, but didn't have any luck. I can tell you I haven't seen many Seahawks fans around here (other than two of my friends from school that have moved). It's mainly Packers and Vikings in these woods. Your best bet may be places like Buffalo Wild Wings, or Joe Sensors in Roseville. I'm pretty sure they show all of the games. Otherwise just pick a sports bar and go meet some people! I'll most likely be at one of the Packers bars around the city the first week, but things tend to stay fairly friendly from what I've seen (as long as it's not Packers vs Vikings).

cchristel	PSA: AirPods available at many Target locations around the Twin Cities | Picked up a pair in Fridley, MN at Target today. They had 5 more available. Checking inventory at brickseek.com shows other availability around the cities. 
cchristel	I bought the S3 Frontier a couple of days ago from Best Buy. I love it so far! Totally worth getting imo.
cchristel	I'm on mobile, but yes it is an option. It's just below the "Add To Cart" button for me.
cchristel	It took me a bit to figure it out. You have to go to New and Used, select new, and pick the one coming directly from Caseology (non prime option for me). The one that was fulfilled by Amazon didn't accept the code.
cchristel	The Galaxy S8 makes the iPhone look like it's ancient. I have an S8 plus and an iPhone 7 plus. Every time I pick up the 7 plus it's like I went back in time. The bezels are massive.
cchristel	We made some moves this off-season to solidify the secondary, but yea I agree!
cchristel	No
cchristel	Hush
cchristel	I honestly can't wait to see him play.
cchristel	Love the guy
cchristel	Nah. We don't need that curse.
cchristel	Agreed. I have a Rodgers jersey from China. Looks fantastic and was super cheap!
cchristel	The price for pie, at the cafe I had lunch at today, is $3.14 | 
cchristel	Not an entire pie, but a slice of pie and ice cream for not even $5. Not a bad deal! 
cchristel	I have no idea what it is, and I'm not sure I want to find out! 
cchristel	Charlie's Cafe in Freeport, MN
cchristel	Oh wow! We were actually discussing how it seemed cheap. This just goes to show it is!
cchristel	I didn't get any actually. I was too full from my patty melt, but I saw the prices and thought it fit here.
cchristel	I was always told that if you could take the comma portion out, and it made a whole sentence, they were needed. I'm certainly no expert either. Grammer and I don't quite get along! 
cchristel	God damn loch ness monster!
cchristel	I've been seeing this interpretation a lot in the comments!
cchristel	Thanks for the help!
cchristel	It's at Charlie's Cafe in Freeport, MN
cchristel	Charlie's Cafe in Freeport, MN
cchristel	Oh dang! Very close then! 
cchristel	No. It's a small cafe in Minnesota. It does start with a C though! 
cchristel	God damn loch ness monster!
cchristel	I feel like a lot of people wouldn't get it unfortunately.
cchristel	Definitely a hot air balloon.
cchristel	Thank you!
cchristel	Well the discussion/argument. I figured they were going to treat me differently, but so far it's alright.
cchristel	Yea, she's cool with it. That's all that matters. Her family is fine too. They aren't treating me differently for it.
cchristel	Mainly because her step brothers are super religious Bible bangers, and want everyone to be the same way.
cchristel	It basically just turned into an alcohol fueled debate that got a little heated. Not overly heated and things seem fine now at least. We will see how the rest of the day goes!
cchristel	Probably not. I blame the alcohol! It has actually turned out fine. They don't seem to be treating me any differently yet. My fiance already kind of knew, but I hadn't fully stated it until last night.
cchristel	Basically that I haven't thought of it much. I didn't give myself a label, or think of where I actually fell in the spectrum.
cchristel	My sweetie just enjoying that sweet sunshine | 
cchristel	Good idea
cchristel	You may be able to request a refund. Not sure to be honest.
cchristel	Where did you order it from?
cchristel	What case?
cchristel	Go with the Z Play. You won't regret it. The battery on that phone is ridiculous!
cchristel	Well if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask.
cchristel	Mmmmm pie
cchristel	Second this. Study up on the installation process, and it's an excellent screen protector.  Edit: I say that because I messed up the first one. PM me if you need tips, because I had to do some special things to get it to work.
cchristel	I'm assuming Nova Launcher.
cchristel	Well shoot. There goes my theory!
cchristel	My guess is that the snapdragon S8s will get updated through the Galaxy Apps store.
cchristel	That’s a huge bonus 
cchristel	Can confirm. Unable to downgrade after getting on iOS 11 Dev beta 2. I had to restore using the iOS 11 beta IPSW to get my phone working again. 
cchristel	It has been working fine for me 
cchristel	Tried to downgrade to 10.3.2....brick city. Any advice? | [removed]
cchristel	From what I’ve been seeing, they still aren’t working. 
cchristel	Check google. I literally just googled install iOS 11 beta without developer account. There are a lot of articles to walk you through it! Enjoy! 
cchristel	It seems to sometimes work and then not work at times. 
tow_away_	Just sparing some options | Everything isn't even that bad. Not broke, good remote job, going to buy my first brand-new car soon. I just like to think that if everything goes to shit I will still have some options available.  So I'm actually educating myself on the suicide technics and preparing some equipment. I.e. I have an exit bag(scuba mask + supply of helium) and a ratchet strap(to choke myself with) as I found these to be the best kinds of suicide with high lethality and easy-to-get equipment. Plus, both are discreet and provide flexibility in location. I even carry a ratchet in my backpack when hiking in the mountains, so I could one day camp somewhere in the woods and finally end my life if I choose to do so.  Not feeling miserable or anything. I actually feel almost nothing, everything seems indifferent to me.  Anyway, have a nice day, random stranger =)
liquidchromium	I get really depressed when I watch Teen Titans, Ben 10, Arthur, Power Ranger; Mystic Force, Jungle fury, and many others. God I miss being a kid and I'm only 17
liquidchromium	Do non-muslims go to hell? | I remember when I was a kid I asked my mom what happens to good non-muslims and bad muslims.  She told me that Allah has already determined everyone's fate and that it is possible for really good people to go to hell and really bad people to go to heaven, and that we should be safe and worship Allah and pray that he shows his mercy on us. 
liquidchromium	lol, obv I know that. I just wanted to reminisce a memory from my childhood. 
liquidchromium	k pls upvote
liquidchromium	I don't feel sad, I just can't sleep at night | I was sexually abused as a kid by 2 of my male relatives, emotionally abused by my father, bullied as a kid cus of my skin color (the desi community is pretty racist), and moved alot as a kid thus became very introverted and lonely.  Although I have every right to be angry at this world, I'm not cus life far more beautiful. I just tell myself that all that I experienced helped me justify leaving the "Religion of peace."   Now that I'm free I just want to enjoy my short life. I don't plan on getting in a long-term relationship or having kids. I just want to live life. 
liquidchromium	Your opinion? | 
liquidchromium	I'm honestly curious, what proof is there that this is not true. | 
liquidchromium	When I was five in madrasa my (female) friend told me a joke.   One day a girl came to the imam  Girl: Imam I am in love with a boy  Imam: Astagfirullah *recites ayat-ul-kurs  Girl: I want to kiss him  Imam: Astagfirullah (x3), who?  Girl: I want to kiss you!!  Imam: *faints* (or *dies* I don't remembeer)   It was funnier when I was 5 lol
liquidchromium	Some waifu material right there | 
liquidchromium	According to r/izlam
liquidchromium	Rip foreskin | 
liquidchromium	I was about to post that here too  The comments are much worse :(
liquidchromium	I don't either. I like mine circumsized. It's just a joke to lighten up the mood around here.
liquidchromium	who?
liquidchromium	A true Jew can out-haggle the Almighty himself. | The Lord said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”  Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?”  “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”  Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?”  He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”  Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?”  Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?”  He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”  Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?”  He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”  When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
liquidchromium	I probably would not exist cus my ancestory includes arab, tamil, singalese, Dutch, Portugese and malay.  Arabs: Muslim traders who decided to settle in Ceylon  Tamil: Low-caste converts to Islam because Islam was an escape from the treacherous caste system  Singalese: Tons of intermixing between tamils and singalese  Dutch: IDK how but my great-grandmother has blue eyes and so do a couple of my cousins (my grandfather looks like a redneck, I have some ginger hair on my beard and head) which probably came from Dutch colonists  Portugese: Reqonquista just ended in the Iberian peninsula so they still held on to the crusading spirit and on some distant Island decided to follow the doctrine of "Kill the Muslim men and rape the women"  Malay: IDK but there are tons of malay muslims in Sri Lanka so I might have some malay in me
liquidchromium	A true Jew can out-haggle the Almighty himself. | [removed]
liquidchromium	Without Muhammad my entire ethnic group wouldn't exist 
liquidchromium	Well people voted for Obama so that the U.S. can CHANGE its foreign standing and not get involved in unnecessary wars, but unfortunately tha r didn't happen.  People voted for Trump so that American tax money would be spent on Americans and not on overseas military interventions, but that doesn't seen it'll change anytime soon.  So as you can see no matter who the American people elect to the White House the status quo doesn't change.
liquidchromium	Well I'm sorry man but you are a lost cause. In all honesty though I'm assuming you to be an extremely grumpy individual but only God can judge. 
liquidchromium	Also u didn't answer my question. What did I say was dumb?
liquidchromium	Dude wth do you mean "how so" you literally insinuated that certain people are undeserving of your sympathy just cus they are Americans
liquidchromium	You think you know more, but you are just closed-minded and unempathetic. 
liquidchromium	What did I say that was dumb? Also I know how the government of my country works.
liquidchromium	What influence do you think regular people have on what goes on in Washington? So you think regular people, including children, should suffer and die just because of their nationality? People like you are the reason Islam is known as the "Religion of pieces" not the "Religion of peace."
liquidchromium	It's scary what r/Izlam thinks about progressive and non-muslims | They don't ever make fun of ISIS or other terror groups, just those Muslims who don't want to waste their time and life being a devout lump of potato.  On phone so can't flair
liquidchromium	Cus they're human beings too
liquidchromium	That's a wee bit bigoted, don't ya think?
liquidchromium	that doesn't matter, matter of fact is that you refuse to pray for innocent human beings just cus they are Americans
liquidchromium	How would you know who they voted for? Southern Florida and major cities (Places which were affected the most) in the south are mostly Democratic. BTW there are good and bad in every group including Rohingya, Syrians, Palestinians, etc. That doesn't mean we should't do our best in trying to help them. I hope that you lose this mentality of "us vs. them" and veiw everyone as equals before God instead of just Muslims
liquidchromium	What proof do you have that any of these assassinations were caused by America (pls provide links cus I'm interested). Maybe you shouldn't blame the Americans for problems in your country that have roots stretching back centuries. Y'know one of the influential prophets in Islam; Isa (A.S.) said "love thy neighbor like you love yourself." Whether you like it or not we are all brothers and sisters including the ultra-conservative Americans and instead of falling to their level of bigotry why don't you cool down and show that Muslims are forgiving and peaceful 
liquidchromium	I couldn't understand why anyone would choose to not be muslim | I remember when I was five years old I went to a big mosque and I heard the iqamat and I thought that I was Allah himself calling people to prayer (although I was a bit disapointed cus I expected God's voice to be much lower) and during prayer I kept thinking to myself why anyone would choose not to be Muslim when god himself is speaking to the Muslims.  After prayer I went to the first row and I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was just a man who was leading prayer. After this incident I remember asking myself why God himself couldn't come down and reveal himself to the Muslims since he is all powerful and omnipotent it shouldn't be that hard for him  I also remember asking myself why God would be male instead of a genderless being and why arabic would be the language of the creator when English (cus English is my first language) was much more straightforward and easier, but I never inferred to anyone about my doubts cus I was an extremely shy kid.
liquidchromium	Then why does he prefer males and is referred to as "he" all the time?
liquidchromium	Welcome man (or woman)
liquidchromium	I'm legally an adult
liquidchromium	OMG I'm in the same situation, my dad used to hit me when I was a kid, used to call me names and he still very verbally abusive (to my mother mostly), I honestly wished they got a divorce cus it isn't a happy marriage. I'm also a senior in high school but I'm male.
liquidchromium	LOL Muhammad got caught | This hadith I found:  The Prophet (peace be upon him) had come to Madînah while they were cross-pollinating their date palms. He asked: “What are these people doing?”  They replied: “This is something that has been our practice.”  He said: “Maybe if you were not to do so, it would be good.”  So they abandoned it and the crop that resulted was impoverished. They mentioned this to him and he said: “I am only a human being. When I command you with something regarding your religion, accept it. When I command you with something from my own opinion, then I am only a human being.”
liquidchromium	Yep pork disgusts me
liquidchromium	I really miss being an 8 year old
liquidchromium	I agree with, today I could've eaten a non-halal turkey sandwich but I didn't because my mind couldn't go through it. P.S. It might not be cus of Islam but I hate the smell of pork
liquidchromium	I actually respect Muhammad | Although I hate him, I have to respect him in that he created a religion which affects the life of nearly 2 billion people and affected world history since his death and makes him seem to be the perfect role model even though he's anything but.
liquidchromium	good
liquidchromium	My name is "gift of god"

liquidchromium	I like listening to Nightcore when I'm on this subreddit | Especially "Nightcore - Alone [Alan Walker]" and "[Nightcore] On My Own."  idk it just calms me down
liquidchromium	I probably would not exist cus my ancestory includes arab, tamil, singalese, Dutch, Portugese and malay.   Arabs: Muslim traders who decided to settle in Ceylon  Tamil: Low-caste converts to Islam because Islam was an escape from the treacherous caste system  Singalese: Tons of intermixing between tamils and singalese  Dutch: IDK how but my great-grandmother has blue eyes and so do a couple of my cousins (my grandfather looks like a redneck, I have some ginger hair on my beard and head) which probably came from Dutch colonists  Portugese: Reqonquista just ended in the Iberian peninsula so they still held on to the crusading spirit and on some distant Island decided to follow the doctrine of "Kill the Muslim men and rape the women"   Malay: IDK but there are tons of malay muslims in Sri Lanka so I might have some malay in me  I still hate Islam though because it is extremely sexist and ruined my relationship with my female cousins
liquidchromium	We have hair on our bodies, our skeletal system is anatomically similar to other great apes, etc.
liquidchromium	hi
liquidchromium	Best Islam ruined my relationship with my female cousin who I considered one of my best friends as a kid, my own sister who I belittled because of my bigotry instiled by the quran and all in all how much I forced myself to waste my time doing etiqaf at mosque and starving myself during Ramadan. All in all Islam ruined my life.  I know it doesn't sound special but I am suffering from PTSD (according to my therapist), Depression and Anxiety and Islam is the cause of most of it.
liquidchromium	FML I had to wake up at 6:00 to pray to a cult I fucking hate
liquidchromium	same man, when I was a kid I was terrified of the afterlife because I repeatedly doubted Islam and was scared that I might go to hell, but now I don't fear death and realized that I should enjoy life for the limited I have on this earth.
liquidchromium	Me :'(
liquidchromium	Me too man. Me too.
liquidchromium	I'm only 17 but I've decided not to have kids
liquidchromium	go to /r/exmuslim
liquidchromium	My idea is a tank. It can kill players and animals easily   
liquidchromium	It started when I was 8 when I realized Islam had many contradictions but I didn't care back then.  When I was 13 I began reseaching Islam and my faith dwindled but I lived in Saudi Arabia and was scared I would get caught, killed and sent to Hell (Although I had my doubts, I was going through a difficult time and believing in God is what calmed me down)  Form that point forward I was an educated liberal Muslim decided to disregard the violent hadiths and quranic verses because I believed, just like the Bible and Torah, were created by men.  When I was 17 due to the extreme stress of school I began to remember horrible memories of my childhood and began to question and get angry at God for making my life fucking shit, I was always a good, curious and hard-working person and the perfect person to represent Islam. I just didn't couldn't believe an all merciful god would make a child go through all that.  The only reason I was muslim for so long despite knowing about its flaws for so long was cus I believed I had a really good life compared to the majority of the world and should be thankful about it.  The only good thing to come from my PTSD is that I manned up and decided to leave that fucking-shit religion that ruined my life. 
liquidchromium	I do agree, but I also want to feel belonged to the community.
liquidchromium	Yea I guess. My accent is a mix of Australian/British-Indian-American accents. While conversing many people say that they like my accent but there are also many who stop me because I am "mispronouncing" a certain word. It also doesn't help that my voice in my head is completely different than my voice irl
liquidchromium	I'm really self conscious about my accent | I moved to the U.S. when I was 14 and I don't think my accent has changed much since the 3 years I've been here  I'm depressed by this because people think English is my second language despite the fact it is my first language
liquidchromium	I could recite the quran quite well 
liquidchromium	it fukin bullshit  they just want to justify all the suffering "Allah" has caused in this world
liquidchromium	same here man 
ballooos	Does this sound like depression? | I'm not sure what depression entails for the most part but I've had some changes and I'm curious if it sounds like depression to everyone. I'm a 17 year old girl and recently I've felt really different. The biggest thing for me is that I literally feel like I have no energy and that everything is so hard to do. Like it feels like laziness but it literally extends to everything I do. I'm just exhausted but not really physically tired... I used to love taking walks with my family but now even leaving the house to get coffee feels like so much work. The second biggest thing is that I am annoyed at every possible small thing. I get so upset at people doing things that I would never previously care about like someone getting in my way in the hallway or something. I also am having trouble sleeping/falling asleep. But the biggest thing is the feeling of laziness I guess. When I'm at school all day, I am staring at the clock counting the seconds and feeling so incredibly mad that I am there. It feels unbearable. I never have ever felt like that before I mean yeah I never liked sitting in class but it literally feels so confining and I feel so upset. I spend the day waiting to get home to just sit there and do nothing. I literally am so upset all day and want to not do anything but be at home and then I get home and I sit there. It's crazy. Does this sound like depression or am I just being a lazy teenager because honestly I could believe that. It's just the feeling of needing to be home/not doing anything that worries me because I don't even want to do things that used to be fun I seriously just want to be home doing absolutely nothing. I have no motivation which is so unlike the old me and I feel so weird. What does this sound like to everyone? Thank you so much for replies 
ballooos	This is great thanks for posting! You mentioned books towards the end, what book would you recommend? 
ballooos	who is your coach? I would love to get in touch with him/her 
ballooos	Thank you for this. What you said makes a lot of sense, especially the part about me not conveying what I want. I just have one question though, I feel like it's difficult to completely be myself during the first few hangouts with a guy and therefore they won't see my full personality, so I'll never know if we would have clicked or not... is that a thing or am I just being crazy? Thank you again 
ballooos	Can someone please help me figure out what's wrong with me? |  I am a 17 year old female and I could not feel more hopeless and flawed right now. I am trying to figure out what is wrong with me in relationships because the exact same thing has happened four times now (I know I'm young but please bear with me). The pattern is essentially that I meet a guy, we go on many dates (typically 6-8) and then when I ask about commitment or something, they tell me they just want to be friends with benefits. Also, I am not just dating noncommittal guys- all 4 of them have been in relationships before so clearly are willing to commit to a girl they like. It usually starts off where they seem to like me a lot but then it slowly dwindles until they only care about a hookup. (Note: a hookup is just making out in this context). In all my relationships so far, I am very bad at showing I like someone so almost all of the guys have wondered if I actually like them or considered them a friend. So I am obviously at least partially to blame for not showing interest. I also rarely ask them to hangout because I don't wanna seem desperate but then at the end when their interest dwindles, I will initiate things and they just seem uninterested at that point so I kind of stopped initiating all together after the first date. Anyways, I feel like something is so wrong with me. Why do all guys leave once they get to know me? I have never felt fully myself around any of them to be fair but I always go into relationships kind of looking for the end result (aka a boyfriend) so that's probably bad too. I'm really bad at showing interest because it makes me vulnerable and I am very bad at being vulnerable so there's that. I also feel like I'm trying too hard and don't ask enough questions about them because I am focused on how I am coming across. Just in general, I feel like I always attract the guy to begin with and they NEVER stay for the long term. I talked to my friends about this an they seem to think that by not initiating anything and by "putting the ball in their court", I somehow make them chose to just want to hook up with me because they don't know my interest level and hooking up is fun and easy? Any truth to this? Please someone help me. What is wrong with me? I literally feel so horrible and flawed and just inadequate and I really want to fix this. Thank you so much to everyone for reading this and/or replying.   TL; DR : every guy is interested in the beginning but loses interest later, I'm bad at conveying interest so they never know I like them, what's wrong with me?

ballooos	How to not be awkward on a first date? | I feel like I come across as really bland and awkward on the first date and they are not interested because my personality doesn't show. Well actually most of them stay interested for some reason but I'm definitely not showing my whole personality and I don't know how to do that. Like they will ask a question and I will look at the ground and give a silly answer... which is not how I am usually like! Has anyone else experienced this, and have any tips to overcome it? I just can't imagine like possibly becoming comfortable enough with someone to date them... I feel like I am always on guard and I don't know how to just be comfortable. I don't even know what to talk about beyond formalities! 
ballooos	This was so helpful!! Thank you!
ballooos	Yes! This is how I went from barely being able to hold my weight on the bar, to doing 10 pull-ups easy! Great advice.
ballooos	What is your best 'first date advice'? | Especially for if you know the guy already but not super close. Thanks :) 
ballooos	Smoking 
ballooos	Candy Land. That game was the shit.
ballooos	I disagree with the other person, I think it does mean she likes you. I have said similar things to guys I like, as it's a way to subtly drop a hint that your available. I say go for it!!
ballooos	The fact that there are people named Bob who were little kids at some point just freaks me out. Imagine calling a baby Bob.
ballooos	assholes and fast walkers 
ballooos	In my opinion/experience, looks is enough to attract the person initially but personality is what makes them continue to be attracted. So in a way, personally is more important than looks but you can't show personality without the initial attraction that typically comes with a good appearance. So, I think it really depends on the goal. If a guy wants to get every girls number, then looks are more important. If he's actually looking to settle with someone, I'd say personality trumps looks. I'm definitely not an expert but that's just my opinion based on my experience!

ballooos	I've noticed that sometimes an insecure person will critique others on exactly what they are insecure about. For example, if someone hates their eyebrows, they will tell others how they need to clean their ups and fix it. 
ballooos	I wish more people were like you :)

ViscoInferno	Struggling more and more each day... | I've posted about how I am about to get a divorce. Long story short, I feel as if I did everything I could to be a good husband, mainly in terms of being there for her in sickness and in health. She has endometriosis and ever since we began dating, she's been dealing with related issues and I've been there for her always. Countless trips to the ER/hospital and many doctors appointments. She had major surgery on the other side of the state two years ago and I took 3 weeks off to care for her as she recoverd.  She has almost always been too sick, sore, tired, or nauseous to want to do much and we haven't had much of a social life and more or less no sex life either. After the surgery, she got off a lot of her usual meds, they only caused more trouble with the side effects, and got approved for medicinal marijuana. We discussed this beforehand and I was fine with it. The pot and a new diet helped her lose nearly 50 pounds and her self esteem grew.  At this point, I admit that her health problems were taking a toll on me. I felt taken for granted and unappreciated. I also was starting to struggle with depression and anxiety. My temper worsened and it drove a bigger wedge between my wife and I. She begged me to begin seeing a therapist and/or getting on antidepressants. I've done both. I realized that the marriage was at risk once my wife began hanging out with new friends and spending less time with me. Once she brought up the idea of having an open marriage, I should have realized it was over.  Despite the fact that I had kept asking her if we were done, she continued to protest the idea of divorce. However, her new lifestyle centered on going out with friends, getting high, and spending a lot of time with other men. We stopped sharing a bed and more or less stopped talking. I was and still am convinced she has been cheating on me, but she still denies it. Even if she wasn't sleeping with anyone else, she still made the choice to spend her time with others, to share her thoughts and feelings with them and cut me out of her emotional mindset.  She finally told me she wanted a divorce the day before her birthday, nearly a month before our 5th anniversary. I've since moved back in with my dad. She no longer will even talk to me so I can get ahold of the necessary papers so I can take responsibility for my personal debts. She's keeping the furniture and staying in the rental property we lived in, as it is owned by her uncle. She has taken my entire life from me, I have nothing, she has everything, and now she is becoming such a bitch to me that I absolutely hate her. The last 7 years of my life have been for nothing.  Now I am stuck at my dad's with no internet, poor cable, and nothing of my own. I have no friends or any social life. My confidence is shot and I have so much anxiety even talking to strangers that I'm unable to work up the nerve to go out and try to make friends. I've never been good at making relationships that last. I've never had a best friend, aside from my wife. I'm lonely and bored and frustrated. I have no privacy at home, so I can't even jerk off to alleviate that frustration.  Before I moved out, my wife confessed she is pansexual and polyamorous. That's fine and dandy, but she could have saved me so much heartache if she had come to that conclusion about who she truly is, before we even got engaged. I no longer feel like I can even trust another woman. From what I've seen on the couple of dating apps I've checked out, there appears to be a lot of poly/pan women out there. I am open-minded, but I am just not that "progressive" I guess. I'm almost 39 and many the women my age already have kids and most of them are educated and have actual careers. I work in a factory and have nothing.  Getting into another relationship is not the answer for me, but I can't even get a simple hook-up if I wanted. I don't know how to talk to people and I nearly panic every time I'm in crowed places. Simply put, I feel completely inept and useless. I am miserable and unable to see anything improving. I feel, at this point, that the most productive thing I could do with my life is end it.  I'm extremely pessimistic and increasingly misanthropic. I have yet to find a public space where I feel comfortable and welcome. I just sit in the library or in the corner of a bookstore just so I can have access to free WiFi and even then I find nothing of interest. I'm lost and drowning. I just lack the courage to take the steps to kill myself.  I'm miserable, angry, tired, bored, lonely, and listless. Nothing seems to help. Everything is just a distraction. I really don't know what to think and I doubt anything or anyone can really help.
ViscoInferno	So far I haven't had a single match save for the bots. I think Tinder is proving itself to be a waste of time.
ViscoInferno	Personally, the art of making friends has always been hard for me to master. I never have much difficulty getting along with others, it's the establishing of strong lasting relationships that I struggle with. Even as a kid, I rarely had any friends I hung around with and even as an adult I have yet to have anyone who I would call a best friend.  Now, as I am about to get divorced, my confidence is shot and my ability to trust is more or less gone. I'm desperate for some sort of connection with another person, but I've always felt like I never quite fit in anywhere I go. I'm terrified by the thought of going out into a social setting, completely alone with no one there to hide next to.  I'm nearly 40 and I don't even know where to start or how to strike up a conversation without doing so from the safety and anonymity of the internet. Face to face interactions give me a sense of dread. Don't even get me started on any talk of starting up a love life again. 
ViscoInferno	She makes me weak in the knees. 
ViscoInferno	I'd rather die.
ViscoInferno	It's been 24 hours since my wife and I officially separated. | After a rough year of not sharing a bed, arguing, not talking to each other, and not seeing one another for days at a time, I finally moved out of our home and back into my father's apartment. My wife and I have been together for just over 7 years, next week would have been our 5th anniversary. I accept my share of the blame and I do have my opinions on what I feel my wife did wrong. I won't get into details of the split and just say we grew apart. We want to keep things amicable, but I just want it over with.  I have been feeling extremely depressed and really angry. My confidence is shot and I feel worthless. My whole life has been taken away from me and I now have to start over completely. I am almost 39 and I feel like a child. It's been months since my wife and I last had sex and the lack of companionship and physical interaction makes for crippling loneliness. I have no friends or social life and my relationship with my family isn't the warmest.  I'm grateful for my dad taking me in, but he himself is a divorcé who is retired and he has been living in the same stuffy apartment for 26 years. My privacy is gone so I can't even relieve certain pressures without feeling I'll be heard. I'm in no shape for dating, but a part of me wishes I could at least find a hook-up. I just can't bring anyone back to my dad's place and, even at nearly 40, I'd feel I was being disrespectful if I stayed out all night without calling. We're always our parents' children after all.  I'm beside myself with grief as I mourn the loss of my marriage. Even though I'm certain she cheated on me and I know for a fact that she used me, I still love her enough to miss her. I just couldn't live with her anymore knowing she really doesn't care about me enough anymore to have fought for us.  Of course I've been fighting off thoughts about suicide and the usual ever present darkness. I've been seeing a psychologist for awhile now and I am on antidepressants as well. Still, trying to keep my mind occupied on work, especially when I hate my job, is increasingly difficult. I am at any point in time either ready to break down in tears or storm off the job in anger.  This weekend will be my first alone, I have no plans or prospects. I just want to feel something positive and not to be obsessing over who my wife is with and what she's doing.  My story isn't unique, but I had to get it out there somewhere. If anything, it keeps me focused for a bit as I attempt to type this out on my crap phone. 
ViscoInferno	Jesus H. Christ, that's hot.

ViscoInferno	Is the hype legit? | I'm on Tinder, mostly out of curiosity. My wife and I are getting a divorce and I'm not really ready to date just yet. I'm living with my dad again and I was never one for hook-ups, but a part of me wants to give it a go. However, I haven't seen a single profile of a woman looking for anything casual.   I'm 38, so maybe I'm too old for any women who are looking to have fun. Still a fella can dream. Is the hook-up hype mostly BS?

ViscoInferno	Songs for the dumped. | It's been just over a week since my wife told me she wants a divorce. Needless to say my emotions have been all over the place and one way I've been seeking solace is through music.   Perhaps some of these songs are a little on the nose and maybe I've misinterpreted some of the lyrics, but here is my modest start to a playlist of songs that accurately describe how I've been feeling. I'd love some suggestions as well. I made the playlist collaborative.   https://open.spotify.com/user/viscoinferno/playlist/4ODRVFlotKv38Z9ZgPTpLj
ViscoInferno	I love my dead gay Liberal talk radio/tv host.
ViscoInferno	Did anyone else read this in Herzog's voice?

ViscoInferno	I really want to make an elaborate home, but I just end up making boxes.
ViscoInferno	I noticed that too. As well as "waaaaggge."
ViscoInferno	I'm going to read this to more at work. Well, I'll listen to the audio book at least.
ViscoInferno	Fuck 'em both. May they each get what's coming to them.

ViscoInferno	I still haven't watched season one. I don't mind more Tennant though, he's an enjoyable actor. 
ViscoInferno	42.
ViscoInferno	I don't want to condone suicide either, but I also can't comfortably say I have any right to force someone to live a life they see as painful or pointless. I myself have had suicidal thoughts for for most of my adult life going as far back as middle school. I currently am facing a potential end to my marriage, I am miserable at my job, I have no friends or social life, and I have no close relationships within my family.   I've been struggling with depression for quite some time and therapy and medication can only do so much. I see the world as a shit hole and life as meaningless. I honestly find myself wishing I were dead often. I have no idea if I'd ever go through with suicide, but I don't feel like anyone has the right to tell me I have to live if they cannot personally fix my problems.   I have to find my own solutions and happiness on my own, but if I can't get onto anything even close to a happy life, I don't know what anyone else could say or do to change my mind. Philosophy, religion, etc. None of that means anything to me. It won't pay my bills, find me a better job, give me a sense of identity or self esteem, nor will it save my marriage.   If a person has lost all hope and no one cares enough to notice until it is too late, I don't know why then suicide would come as such a surprise. 
ViscoInferno	Those freckles kill me.

ViscoInferno	I could watch this all day.
ViscoInferno	Heheheheh. -sighs- Yeah.
ViscoInferno	To be fair(?) Didn't Williams basically say the same thing herself about men vs women in general when it comes to the way they both play the game?
ViscoInferno	How many words? Is some intrepid lovely going to go through all the episodes up to this point and create a word database and/or a word cloud of the most-used words? #FirstEverRedditComment
problemthrowaway8784	Thank you for the kind words. It does help.
problemthrowaway8784	I'm in an outpatient program through the local hospital, using group therapy sessions. It's pretty intensive and is basically 7 hours a day for two says a week. It's hard to tell if it's helping yet but I was prescribed medication which I'm still getting used To (it just sedates me right now). Every day I go through phases of feeling decent to feeling completely down.
problemthrowaway8784	Came closer today than before. | I was parking my car in the garage, and had a serious thought about closing the garage door and keeping the car running. Then, when I got inside my house, I caught myself looking for razors to slit my wrists. I feel like the thoughts I'm having are becoming more severe and are almost manifesting.
problemthrowaway8784	Thanks all, for the helpful comments. I'm seeing my therapist on Tuesday, and hopefully I can get myself under control (or at least talk to someone). 
problemthrowaway8784	I Feel like a monster. | I'm struggling with being overwhelmed and the other day, my son's cry made me so angry I just pinched him hard. It's so hard for me to restrain myself and I feel like I'm just angry at him for existing. Its just really hard for me to see the positive now and I hate myself for feeling like this. I just can't believe I resorted to hurting him and couldn't control myself. 
Surrealistic_pillow5	Going back to school | So I'm a 22 year old man trying to go back to school. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get the money to do this; I just don't know much about anything in regards to getting student loans and that whole shebang. In a way I feel like I'm asking a lot but...where should I go to find scholarships?  How does one obtain the student loans necessary to pay tuition? I think I should add that I'm looking to go back to community college first. Again, please bear with me; I'm very ignorant about this whole process. 
Surrealistic_pillow5	I feel so fucking weak | Goddammit. I feel fucking cursed. Why. The. Fuck. Can't. I Feel. Happy? Why am I so fucking stupid and immature? Why can't I just feel fucking ok and fucking stay that way for good? Why can't I just fucking BE who I want to be without falling apart every time? I'm scared my mom's not gonna be around too much longer and I just can't stop thinking about how much of a disappointment of a son I am to both my parents, and to myself for that matter. Why can't be a normal, functional fucking person? Why do I have to be mentally fucking ill? Because it seems like the only way to ever be rid of it is to be fucking dead. My life has already been a complete waste.
Surrealistic_pillow5	We are all alone.
Surrealistic_pillow5	Have you heard his new cd?
Surrealistic_pillow5	I'm Far Stupider for having Suffered Depression | I don't even know how to enjoy life anymore. The worst thing is how stupid I've really become. I'm incredibly inarticulate and socially awkward. My vocabulary went down the drain. My working memory is utter shit and my long term memory doesn't seem to be able to internalize most things. I have fucking zero awareness of the date and passing of time, making me feel both stupid and that every second is a waste. I feel like I'm just  about as intelligent as your average elementary schooler. My ability to focus is shit. I have difficulty learning  because guess what? I'm fucking depressed. How am I supposed to learn ANYTHING if I have zero interest in it? This just fucking sucks. Despite every fucking thing I do to try to fix these mental deficits, it feels like nothing gets better. Especially the part about being socially awkward. I fucking can't for the life of me just talk to people and converse normally. Tbh I don't even fucking want to most of the time. I tell myself I want to be normal and build a healthy social network, but I think that's just my mind trying to be practical. There is no intrinsic value in interpersonal relationships for me anymore. Maintaining them is just another chore like everything else. And look, here I am complaining again like a little fucking kid. Stop with the self loathing! Grow up! You'll get nowhere thinking like this! Fuck you. Fuck you a million times. But more importantly, fuck me. I fucking suck as a person and I don't even want to get better at this point. I just want to die. 
Surrealistic_pillow5	What is mental health? | I don't mean that literally, but it kind of plays into how I feel. I feel like my mental health has completely deteriorated. I think I suffered from clinical depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, loneliness, and avoidant personality since age 11, and *I was never truly aware of it* until after high school. I feel like this has left me horribly developmentally stunted. I feel like my entire life has been one large distraction from life itself, having spent nearly all of my free time playing videogames and watching television that did absolutely nothing to improve who I was in any way. I think I only ever swam in my youth (swam usa club teams for 7 years) was because the endorphin release it provided was merely another means to escape feelings of anger, boredom, loneliness, depression, and inferiority. I kept sacrificing so much of my time towards it because of the escape. The only reason I gave a shit about my times or stoke technique was because it helped me feel superior to other people. But don't mistake me here, I didn't flaunt my (in the grand scheme of things) unimpressive swimming abilities in people's faces; I just quietly basked in the glory that came from being better at something than most people, despite also not being very good in the world of people who took swimming seriously. I never had any solid interests in anything important growing up. I still don't really, but being an adult forces you to semi-care about the important things. Things that I not once ever seriously considered. Like who I am, what my role in society is, what I'm good at, where I need to improve, what the road to succeess looks like, what path I should take in my life, etc. I always coasted along on this strange, unjustifiable feeling that I was great and deserved great things, in an almost narcissistic way. I lived constantly in fantasy and daydreams of accomplishing whatever I wanted to at the time, but never actually did anything to get there because from an incredibly young age, probably starting in  elementary school, I always felt inferior, and I never resolved these issues because I never felt comfortable talking to anyone (like my parents) about these internal struggles. From the day I was born I never vocalized my feelings of inferiority, which I think is partly because of shame but also not thinking anything of if. Why? Idk. I blame it on myself for being a dumb kid who never learned how to communicate these things, and still don't to this day because it would be plain inappropriate to share these things with a fellow adult who isn't a shrink that I can't afford. I could talk to my parents but I have and let me assure they are far, far from able to provide me any solace. My mom is 52 and faces issues that fall in line with early dementia and has too many complicated emotional issues of her own to ever be able to help me. My father is 61, suffered a stroke deeply effecting his ability to properly socialize and also suffers from depression and low self-esteem. He actually went to the hospital for suicidal ideation this summer. Anyways I'm so tired, I can'y fucking finish this post and say all I wanna say, but fuck I want to jump off the Harry Nice bridge so fucking bad. The only word I can use to accurately describe myself is "broken", and as you can see that just barely scratches the surface.  I'd like to go into how becoming more aware of this brokenness in highschool lead to a weed habit that sabotaged pretty much every shot at success I had to this very day,  and how that just provided a nicer escape with the added bonus of but a semblance of a social life that I was (and still am) so desperate to have. The ultimate escape just seems too appealing at this point. 
Surrealistic_pillow5	I keep trying to tell myself life goes on | You know, like The Dude says. No matter all the shit that get's thrown at him, he knows in the end it's all ok. Can't be worried about that shit! Life goes on!  But idk man I just feel so fucking dead. How am I supposed to have the motivation to do anything when I don't have any confidence and I don't feel joy anyways? It's like happiness is physically impossible to achieve and maintain. I feel even worse for even being like this. Not in a beat-myself-up kind of way, but in an angsty, "goddammit how did I get like this and why am I so deeply broken" sort of way. I think the only thing I actually feel is frustration that I'm so mentally off. It's like will I ever be normal again? Idk
Surrealistic_pillow5	My dad is definitely falling victim to this. He's 61 and JUST starting to make progress on a ton of debt that, while his own doing, has been hampering him physically and emotionally for over a decade. He tried so, so hard to make his small business work, doing the only thing he really knows. Things went pretty well for a while  but that all fell apart once the recession hit. He's had a major struggle with depression, anxiety, addiction, and suicidal ideation ever since, and to this day he has almost nothing to show for all his hard work.
Shawncb	My password for my Wi-Fi is Itsaseceret
Shawncb	Why do you want to go through with it?
Shawncb	I'm so happy you didn't keep the car running. I'm not an expert. And my words may not resonate very well. And you don't know me. But I know you. You're strong even Tho you may not feel like it. You're hurting. And that's OK. I'm glad you made it past those thoughts. Even if it's just for now. That makes you stronger than you know. 
Shawncb	Hi there. I don't want to come off the wrong way, and I mean no offense. But I'm happy you're here. I'm not the best at this, I'll admit. But I'd love to talk if you can?
Shawncb	It's not about me. I need advice. | I have a best friend. She's actually my ex. We split up less than two months ago. She's a wonderful person but we drifted apart. Being how wonderful she is I decided she should be my friend. But I have a problem. She has always been depressed and has anxiety. In all our time together I was her rock. Today (tonight) she was telling me that she can't take it anymore. She wants to die. She tells me that she can't survive without me to be there for her. The things that held her in a better place were the warm touch and the feeling that I am there for her no matter what. When she couldn't get out of bed or off the floor I was there to pick her up. When she couldn't eat I made her soup to drink. If she couldn't drink I got watermelon so she could get water when she eats. I did these things because I saw her pain. I loved her. I still love her. The problem is I couldn't keep being dragged down with her. When she got bad I got bad. I kept it to myself but I hurt. I would get depressed. No motivation. No care to take care of myself. But when she was there I would hide it. So we drifted apart. We split up. I am still trying to be there for her but I can't be that. What I was. She is asking me to look after the dog that she got in the split. I know this might sound like she is emotionally abusive to some. But trust me it's not. I'm a sympathetic emotional. But I don't let anyone in. She never forced me or abused me. And now she is saying without me she will never get better. She says she'll never find anything. I tell her she will and she still has me no matter what. I just don't know what to do. When she gets this way I get angry. She doesn't see it or hear it. But all I want to do is punch a wall. In part because I can't help and in part because it's taking me down again. I need some advice. How can I help her? How can I make things better? She's scared of therapists because of a bad session. She hates pills because they make her sick. I don't know what to do. Sorry its so long. If you can't help its OK I needed to vent mostly. Any advice is much appreciated. 
Shawncb	I hope so too. I really appreciate your perspective and advice. 
Shawncb	That's actually very very helpful. Thank you so much. 
Shawncb	I want help. I do. But nobody understands like I do. Her parents just tell her it'll be OK. Keep a positive attitude. Her friends don't know what it's like. I don't know how I can get help. 
Shawncb	We did have a slip up once. And I understand you aren't being mean. She is vulnerable. And I agree 100%. My problem is I don't know how to talk her off the edge without going back to her. But going back to her just isn't a very good choice. 
Shawncb	No I haven't moved on with anyone else. I still do love with her. But I can't be with her anymore. At least not in that way and not right now. 
Shawncb	Hey there. I'm happy to talk to you. 
Shawncb	What's happening? Why can't you do it anymore? I know it may be hard, but if you could talk to me for a bit, I'd like to get to know you first. 
Shawncb	It's late September and I really should be back to school. 
Shawncb	When I would go in highschool, (not long ago, but all I could afford then) I would walk out spending no more than $35 after meal and tip. That's two meals and the salad and shit they give you. So unless you plan on drinking a lot of their shitty cocktails, 60 is more than enough.

She finally told me i was calling for her daughter, and she had passed away the night before in a car accident. Not even a two full days after I talked to her about getting car insurance.

Shawncb	Well unfortunately I don't have much experience. This is a recent decision and I have a lot to learn. All of my previous experience is customer service/sales type stuff.   Thanks for the advice on certs! I'll look into what my school offers. Any advice on where to get experience? 
Shawncb	Oh fuck I missed that. Lol
Shawncb	Oh that's an awesome plan. I will look into that too! Thanks so much! I joined that too. I'm hoping I can get a small business job so I can learn some stuff. 
Shawncb	Haha. Not opposed to it. My time in customer service has made me the guy you send the impossible people to. But I want to see what all my options are and find out what end I want to get in. 
Shawncb	Oh wow. I'll look into that. 
Shawncb	Ok cool. I'm getting my associates atm. I'll look at all the options for sure. 
Shawncb	I'm OK with that already. Lol. Thanks for the advice.
Shawncb	Awesome. I will start doing that asap. I know of a few small repair shops I may be able to get part time work at while at school!

Shawncb	You know this would make an awesome children's book. "The Little Kid With The Red Shoes"
Shawncb	Seeing a sub created is always a great feeling. 
Shawncb	Agreed. Just watched this one and some tactical decisions (not even game mechanics IDK about just tactical combat) had me yelling at Alex and Vinny. But I live it so much. Lol
Shawncb	I'm so glad I'm not crazy familiar with this game, because judging from the comments, it would get so frustrating. Lol. Episode one with Abby at the helm was amazing. Can't wait to get home and see this one. So happy I got premium for this. 
Shawncb	Fucking love this. Thank you. 
Shawncb	Make sure your router is set to a static IP address. Portforwarding dot com had some good software to do it for you. And make sure to port forward the appropriate port. I think it's 23556 or something? But that's what our issue was. Host didn't have static IP. 
Shawncb	The confusion of saying the 70's were 30 years ago. Implies the year his mind is stuck in is 2000, therefore the 70's are 70 years from now.
Shawncb	Yes, walking around without shoes is hell. 
Shawncb	I realized freedom is nice
Shawncb	Some Good From Managment | [removed]
Shawncb	Hey guys. I've followed your game on imgur and reddit off and on over the last few years. How long has it been? Feels like forever. I can't wait to pick up the game when I get home tonight! (You caught me on pay day and I'm feeling good!) I don't really have a question I just wanted to say this is awesome! I can't wait to be a badass mage tonight! Also the amount of work you two have put in is amazing. And the live for your families I've been seeing in this AMA.   My cousin and I actually recently did the same as we both downloaded UE4 and started playing around! You two have inspired me to try and stick to it. Maybe soon I'll get a vision and want to create something fun too! Thanks for all your work fellas!
Shawncb	You are a god sir. A GOD!
Shawncb	What is that most called again? I couldn't find it. 
Shawncb	I'm OK with that
Shawncb	Extension of our lifespan. 
Shawncb	Yupyup
Shawncb	The issue was host didn't set up his Static IP. The client won't connect to the host when the IP of host is always changing. We thought we had static IP set up but his router had a reset measure for security. 
Shawncb	He connects to his server np. It's when we bring other clients (I.e. me) onto it we're presented with am error telling me that the port is wrong or the firewall won't allow UDP assets or something. Problem being we know the port is right, both of our routers are forwarded to the 25565 port and maintain static IP, firewall as far as I know has exceptions, and he can't even see me attempting to connect on the server's cmd.
Shawncb	I'm getting the udp assets not going through error (or something thereof), however if I enter another server it's fine. But we can't set it up on his machine. He says he checked the firewall and added exceptions to the tes3mp stuff. I'm not too sure though beyond that. I've even tried temporarily disabling my firewall and it wasn't working. 
Shawncb	How to set up server | ~~My buddy and I are trying to set up a server, however his ping is always 999 and the connect button is greyed. We have port forwarded but dk what else to do. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated.  u/cybra117~~  Edit: Solved! Thanks for the help guys!
Shawncb	Bar/lounge
Shawncb	Yes! It's my filler while I'm processing what they said.
Shawncb	I'll tangent into the other stories so you know the full background of who and why before I tell you the thing I set out to say an hour ago. 
Shawncb	It's an automatic response. I don't want them to repeat themselves! But everytime I try to stop I still do it, day "no no wait I heard you that's just an automatic response." And in that time of focusing on it I've not heard what they said and they still repeat themselves. No win. 
Shawncb	Pen clicking. Sorry all
Shawncb	Oh I understand that entirely. My tics are very mild so it's never been crazy disruptive. But yeah we're all different. Going to have a different take on it and I respect that for sure. 
Shawncb	Oh OK that's really good! Yeah for sure. I have it very mildly and I honestly know that there is worse. However that doesn't make it any easier on you and it's totally OK to know that Imo. Lol. 
Shawncb	Oh that sounds especially difficult. I can imagine some very difficult conversations with people and even people not believing you if you say you have tourettes. Is it hard to catch yourself sometimes when you stop the full thing? I choose not to suppress my physical tics unless I get caught in a loop for more than 10 minutes. Then I need someone to distract me to suppress the loop. 
Shawncb	Oh I do the same thing! People will ask about it and I'll just be like "you're goddamned right I do. All the fucking time. But my grandfather was a sailor. Most of us don't cuss." I'll take a very serious turn towards the end sometimes too make people freak out a little. Lol. 
Shawncb	I understand that. I'd play of of it and take a piss on the people who ask. "What's so funny?" "I saw you!"
Shawncb	Sounds great! Slow day at work so I might pop in!
Shawncb	Idk what to comment so here's my comment. Lol
Shawncb	Oh yes I'm well aware and very unprepared. Lol. I'd like to find at least one thing though. I have recently decided to quit my job and go back to school for computer science. One of my to many passions. But circumstances lined up to make it possible so I made my choice. Still I like to know the options! 
Shawncb	Yeah for sure. It can be really uncomfortable at first I'm sure. But confidence is key! You know you. You know you're awesome. Don't let a little worry keep you from what you love. Plus we have this amazing sub with tons of very supportive people. I've only just discovered it and I'm so happy with the amount of information and support I've received in less than a week. If ever you have issues you know you can turn to the fine people of reddit. But like I said, confidence. You gotta always remember that you're the best person out there, regardless of who's around. I'm a little cocky at times so I may sound like an ass. Lol. But being confident in the fact that I'm number 1 is what keeps me in a good state of mind and helped me get through the toughest part of my tourettes. 
Shawncb	I'm 22 atm. Will be 23 in November. Why do you ask?
Shawncb	 I've grown accustomed to mine so I like seeing them personally. Discover the nuances and see what I actually do versus what I think I do. My advice is just bury yourself in editing one day to just not let it phase you. I see it the same way everyone hates their voice but gets over it after hearing it for a while. But then again I'm neither a medical nor mental professional so that could be horrible advice. 
Shawncb	Respect man. That's good info. I'm at the stage in my life where IDK what career I may want, so I like to do a little research into the things I love. I appreciate the info and the advice! It's great stuff
Shawncb	I only mind when I get caught in a loop. Sometimes I end up having trouble actually breathing in because I'm exhaling so much. However mine doesn't produce noise in the same way. It just sounds like I'm breathing sharply. 
Shawncb	Are by chance looking for a number 3? Lol. That's awesome. I did not know there were schools for this! I will absolutely be looking into. I love beer more than I should. It's my absolute preferred drink. You have me very curious. Thank you for that info!
Shawncb	How does one become a professional brewer? Is it beer you brew? Or something else?
Shawncb	I've had the good pleasure of my bossing being mindful of my situation personally. I recall one time at my retail position, I was allowed to leave a meeting because I was having a fit that was particularly bad compared to normal. My boss just asked if I'd be more comfortable catching up with him later. I've never had to try and suppress them in a group setting and personally I don't think I'm willing to. 
Shawncb	I think my winking tic really helps with it. In high school a lot of girls thought I was flirting because I was winking at them. In reality I was just spacing out. But with that came conversations with girls that taught me to be open about it and I learned how good of an ice breaker it is. I always encourage enquiring minds and I want people to ask questions. I may not know a lot, and from discovering this sub recently I've learned how little I do know, but I love to share with people and explain to them. Maybe they can teach someone else and more people will better understand it. I also strongly encourage people to focus on the good interactions. In my experience the good interactions are much more impactful than bad. (Pretty sure impactful isn't a word but oh well) I also learned to have a thicker skin. Growing up one of my best friends is my cousin, Robby. He's deaf. So it's constant between us insulting each other and picking on our situations. Deafy Duck and Tweak are commonly used at each other. Lol. Of course in insulting each other jokingly, we've grown to really respect the others position. So much so, in fact, that I've been attempting to learn American Sign Language along side him, and he's done extensive research into tourettes at times. He's also one of the people who knows how to pull me out of a bad loop like my girlfriend does. I've had no shortage of bullying and support due to my tourettes. But in the end it's what makes me appreciate so much and be so confident and open. The way I see it, if I can comfortably interact with a person while I'm having tics, I can do anything and not be confident. I have a profound interest in other cultures and people with different disorders because of what I've experienced. And the only reason I can feel this way is because I'm so willing to use it to my advantage. Lol. 
Shawncb	Yeah it's disorder thing. Happens to me all the time without that headset. Another quick fix you can try is discovering from the specific group you're in then rejoining that group. 
Shawncb	I work customer service and sales. For 2.5 years I was in retail and now I sell insurance. I find my tics (especially the winking) are a good ice breaker or conversation starter. I love when people ask questions about it and it gets me in the door of a conversation, and they already feel comfortable with me because they feel like I've opened up to them. It helps that I'm a very optimistic person and easy to talk to. 
Shawncb	That's an interesting one. I've noticed that when I'm in a stressful or relaxing environment my tics are lessened. When I'm somewhere in the middle is my worst. Something about focusing on the stress or relaxation helps subside my tics temporarily. 
Shawncb	Oh OK that's good to know. Thank you!   That's interesting. I probably should pay attention to my day-to-day a little more and see if any of the things I do may be tics.   Edit: I also get this tic, you could call it, where if something is to close to my eye or in my peripheral, especially sharp or pointed objects, it causes extreme discomfort in my eyes that borderlines pain. The only way I can make it stop is my applying a small amount of pressure to my closed eyes. However I've noticed that wearing glasses significantly reduced my exposure to this. Be it sun glasses or eye glasses. However I don't have bad eyesight so I don't have prescription glasses. Lol. 
Shawncb	> Oof, 3 hours?  Unfortunately yeah. However the next closet length I can think of was maybe half an hour, so that was just a particularly bad one. I was alone that time so I had no-one to pull me out of the loop. My girlfriend will catch me in the loop sometimes and give me a minute or two to let it pass and see of it subsides, and if it doesn't she'll just softly touch me and it pulls me right out. On that occasion I was alone and it's not a bad one. I just kind of blank my mind and do it. So I didn't really notice the time passing. The worst one I experienced Imo was a breathing one. I was caught in a loop of exhaling so sharply to expel all air from my lungs for like ten minutes. When I get that too I find it impossible to breath in. It's the same feeling you get when you get sleep paralysis, where you try so hard to tell your body to do something but it just won't listen. I felt like I was Gunna pass out when it finally happened. It's worth noting that these are my war stories. Lol. Very rare it gets this bad.   > I dunno what exactly I have.  What is the difference between TTD and tourettes? I've seen mention of TTD a few times since I've discovered this sub but I don't actually know the difference.   > I'm starting to realize I'm less tic-free than I thought...  I'm starting to notice this as well. I've grown out of a lot of my tics but they've been picked up by new not so painful ones. I don't kick my leg anymore but my breathing tics have become worse. I don't clench my knock to much but I jerk my shoulder now. I think I have grown out of many and it's not as bad. But I'm starting to notice more and more that I still have tics that happen all the time. 
Shawncb	Wow. Well I really appreciate the info! So you have a trigger for your vocal ticks? I have a tic where I close one eye and use the outline of my brow to trace lights. It's a very weird and specific tic. I've gotten stuck in the loop for almost 3 hours once. But it can be triggered by a new light turning on. Though I never really thought about it until I read that. 
Shawncb	Definitely. The single player is awesome. Hearty online community
Shawncb	Wa-hoo works perfectly. I instantly knew what you meant before I moved on. Lol. 
Shawncb	TIL that I do have vocal tics. I had no idea my breathing tics were vocal tics. I get the same ones where I exhale sharply. When I have a bad fit sometimes it feels impossible to breathe in. 
Shawncb	Oh really? I had no idea. Thanks for the info. 
Shawncb	Vocal tics? | I was diagnosed when I was around 4 years old. As I've grown I've aged out of a lot of my tics. However when I was diagnosed it was diagnosed as mild. I had a lot of nights spent awake with aches and cramps due to tics, but I never had any vocal tics. I've had some breathing ones (still do at times) but nothing vocal. I just kinda want to know how any of you felt with them? How was growing up? I'm 22 and lived with tourettes my whole life but there's still so much I don't understand about it. So have/do you had vocal tics? Known someone who does/did? How is it? 
Shawncb	Wow you have siblings with it? My brother got lucky. Lol. 
Shawncb	I'd love this reminder as well. 
Shawncb	Stress for me brings out a lot of the old tics I've grown out of. 
Shawncb	I have a very mild form of it. As I grew up I was one of the lucky ones to grow out of most of it. But I've never felt the urge to laugh I don't think unless they were doing it jokingly. I had a teacher who was very good with me cause her husband had tourettes and one day we went to dinner with them (my parents and I) and he was throwing around jokes like no tomorrow. Seeing that kind of helped my parents with dealing with having a child with tourettes. 
Shawncb	It's all just opinion. Nothing wrong with their opinion. I agree they're justified. I personally won't buy until I see it at 15 because I've already bought it. 
Shawncb	Good point. I can see that reasoning. Sorry to dig into you're personal life! I just got so interested. Lol. Congrats on your baby BTW! Even if she has tourettes, you know she'll be in the best place she can to deal with it. Thank you for answering my questions (:
Shawncb	I was under the impression that it's not genetic? 
Valtorix28	DAE feel this way? | DAE always feel like they're a decent person, and always tries to be a "genuine good" person, but deep down feels like everyone they know hates them and doesn't want to hang out with them because of it? I always feel like "my friends" aren't really my friends and only tolerate me because they have to, and they would prefer to not deal with me.   No? No one else....?
Valtorix28	What about which language and / or engines have you used / comfortable with using? It's just really cool to see females code / make games
Valtorix28	What games have you made? I'm currently studying Game Engineering so I'm just curious
Valtorix28	Wow, I thought my school was the only one wanting to fuck me
Valtorix28	What did you code In? Was it truly 100% just you or a group of friends / random? Do you have any plans to showcase it at any conventions? 
Valtorix28	I agree, please don't delete your account. You're a pretty face and I'd hate to see you go.   P.s. this dude messaged me this morning to sell me them. I figured it was weird because you could just sell them to me. 
Valtorix28	I did this in my school's lab one day. 22 computers for over 5 hours. Then I heard other people talking, and someone said "yeah they've been playing that fucking song for the last five hours, I fucking hate it"
Valtorix28	You are legit too cute
Valtorix28	I would rub my tongue all over that tummy. Sorry, I just had to say it.
Valtorix28	My advice would be to take those blades and throw them in a dumpster that your University owns. you're already 2 months clean and you said it feels good, but you don't want it to be broken right? So just throw them away, don't think about it, just go outside and throw them in the dumpster. I haven't even beeen able to make it past 7 days.   So for the rest of us that are too "weak" to make it that long, stay strong.
Valtorix28	We talked for a little bit. Then we're going to go on a date, then completely ignored me. 
Valtorix28	I've definitely thought about it, but I always remember that it never happened with any of the girls before, so why would this one be any different?   It's a tough pickle. My anxiety kicks in hard. That and the fact that there are a ton of other good looking guys that play Frisbee.
Valtorix28	How I see it when spending money on stuff, not just Yugi in general, is are you getting your moneys worth? If you spend $100 on Yugi and you play it twice a week for about a month, I'd say that you're definitely getting the money worth.   People spend $100 on drugs, and it only lasts them for a few hours, so there are worst things you can do with your money.   An example I'll use, I spent $60 on RSS, when it released in 2015. I've put in roughly 25 days in the game. Needless to say, I've gotten my moneys worth.
Valtorix28	I want to so badly with this one cute girl at my frisbee club. But when I get close to doing it my anxiety kicks in and I just tell myself "nah, don't waste her time with you". So I continue on being me.
Valtorix28	Hey Alan, big fan.   Two questions. Tucker and Dale is a great comedy and I've introduced it to so many people who've all loved it. Do you think there will be a sequel?   Second, my school hosts a Human Vz Zombies game every semester, would you like to join our next one in the spring?

Valtorix28	Does anyone else always wonder what it must be like to be "good looking"? | My college started back up, so I went to the gym today to do some weight lifting and try and clear my head, and there was a cute girl in there and I noticed that she was "eye fucking" these other guys and talking to her friend and they'd look over at them, giggle, then talk again to one another.   Some days are better than others but I just would like to know.
Valtorix28	You're very welcome. You might want to include specifics though, like when is the wedding, if the pre / post parties are mandatory or optional, if we'd need to bring a wedding present, etc!
Valtorix28	Hot damn, you're cute AF, someone better take you. (I would definitely do it, but I'm a few states away)
Valtorix28	Honestly, imo, they should have put up a third matchmaking option that is specifically for "Pro League" player or one that has all the maps, either one would work. My favorite maps are now no longer gonna be in Ranked and that upsets me.   #SeeYouSoonHereford

Valtorix28	I'm a straight guy, but I always enjoy it when gay guys flirt and hit on me, because that way, if I do decide to go gay, I can get a boyfriend at least. 
Valtorix28	This beautiful girl I know is trying to work it out with her (ex?),, boyfriend. This guy is in jail because he beat her, choked her and withheld her from calling the cops. When I asked her about it she said, "I don't like giving up on people, it wasn't his fault, he was drunk when it happened"  Idk if she's being honest with me or trying to nicely lie to me, but this is stupid.
Valtorix28	Here's an example I remember, all A's will be shuffled by the values of C's, B's will be Z's, etc etc.   This is substitution ceasar right? Or am I getting it all mixed up?

Valtorix28	What are some things you like to do in your free time? 
Valtorix28	I always follow that up with "..I'm still alive.."
Valtorix28	Or I did that in 2015, after the tax season. I think it was from May to August or something like that. Idk it was a while ago.   And thanks, I'll remember to put something like that next time when it comes up.   And yeah I barely eat ramen now. But I'll have to here soon because of finances and moving into a different place.
Valtorix28	Thanks, I did something like that. I worked at a car factory for roughly 2.5 months and made around 6 grand, and lived off campus. My monthly bills were around 500. So I was able to not work for awhile, but I still tried getting a job, but the poor college town not many were available. Granted my grandma did send me like 50bucks a month for foods but still. (I ate ramen noodles, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, for four months straight just to save money )  And the school really is. The professors, classes and other students are great, but the "school" is not that great. 
Valtorix28	It was in 2015, but I didn't get any of the W-2s or whatever until 2016, but I did put down that I worked in 2015 but didn't file taxes (yet , or whatever).  But as I said, the school is fucking retarded and is a hassle.   And yeah, that or fish and Rice. I have friends in the military and they tell me about them.
Valtorix28	Wow, this is amazing. I went to Epcot at Disney to their French pavilion and I met a French girl. Needless to say, I fell in love with their accents and I am on a mission to end up with a French women!
Valtorix28	What are y'all studying for? Any ambitions or plans to make this an actual business? 
Valtorix28	I know how you feel man. I flunked out last year and now I'm trying to stay in college because I feel like it'll be the only thing that will give me a slight glimmer of "hope". I have 20 credits left to graduate, but since I have a 1.97 gpa my college is suspending me for 6 semesters. If I can't go back this year, I will probably kill myself.
Valtorix28	This. This is why I don't get it when people commit suicide when they have kids. I mean, I understand about the feelings but if you have children you have something much more valuable to fight for.   But I'm glad that you are fighting for him 
Valtorix28	This pisses me off. I didn't work in 2015 as well, and when I redid my FAFSA, sent to my school and everything, my school took away my financial aid because "it didn't make sense how I was living off campus without a job during the 2015 year". (Because since I didn't work, I didn't need to fill out taxes and all that) believe me...I was / am pissed about it.
Valtorix28	I will always remember this because it's an awesome and amazing story, but about two years ago when I started playing competitively, I saw this elder women playing, she was roughly 60+ years old, and I noticed that she was always playing with her cards right in front of her eyes and always at the same spot (or table if you will). So after the third round I went up to her and asked her if she needed any help or anything and I was curious about what she was doing there.   She told me that she could barely see out of half of her right eye and that she was there playing with her son and they do it all the time. She requested that she always has the same spot so it's easier to get to the door and that way her son would know where she would be. It was awesome to hear. I did end up dueling her, for fun, and she 2-0 me. It was definitely worth it. I hope I still have this passion when I'm her age.

Valtorix28	This. Everyday. Everyday I go without hearing from someone, I'm always like, guess no one actually likes me then.
Valtorix28	In all honesty it depends on what build, I've been running harpies for years and never used inferno. 
Valtorix28	I just need to survive a few more days... | Then I can finally cut on my arms again and feel the relief that it brings me...
Valtorix28	To me, it makes me feel worthless. Like fuck. I must suck so bad that I'm not even worth a simple reply huh?
Valtorix28	Seeing that your message was "read" / "seen" several hours ago just really kicks start the depression, or is it just me? | 
Valtorix28	Anymore of her?
Valtorix28	Oh no, you got rid of the landing strip...

Valtorix28	Just keep yourself busy. Whenever you get a urge or something , do something else. Push-ups and sit-ups or go run. Something
Valtorix28	I think about it every day. I don't get why I do my day to day activities bc I want to die and I'm like "there is no point in this, I'm gonna kill myself anyways".
Valtorix28	Depression is the worst thing ever! | It's my birthday today...I should feel "happy" but I don't. I feel far from it. It's all because of depression and having suicidal thoughts. I really tried to go through the whole day without any sad thoughts but it didn't happen. I'm so tired. 
Valtorix28	How did NASA come up with the name NASA? Would you change it if you could, and if so what would you rename it to?

Valtorix28	Well thank you. 
Valtorix28	I started when I was around 13/14 and am now 24(my birthday is Friday so I'll be 25) and I've been cutting everyday for the past 16 months(apart from my relaspe last night, where I was 30+ days clean). 
Valtorix28	I have a "Three" rule in regards to the opposite sex. I send out three text messages and if I don't get a reply I quick
Valtorix28	Girls who think they can do stuff and be guilted by it, but when a guy does it, all hell breaks loose
Valtorix28	Thank you for the kind words. I am sorry to disappoint you but I had to SH on my upper thigh. I just couldn't take it any more. Afterwards though, I came up with a poem, or a quote, and would like to hear what you think. It's a short one so don't worry.   Self-Harming: Two minutes of relief, Lifetime of regrets. 
Valtorix28	30+ days clean but.. | ...I'm starting to have a relapse now. I got back from Walmart and I bought razor blades, band aids and peroxide. I actually look forward to when I take a shower tonight so I can cut into my thigh....
Valtorix28	Rule of thumb with regards to the game biz. 1 hour per $1. If it's an RPG or similar, 2 hours per $1
Valtorix28	My birthday is this Friday. And I'm on the verge right now.
Valtorix28	I agree so much. If a guy doesn't want to date a girl, he needs to have several documents describing why. But if a girl doesn't want to date a guy, we just gotta respect that and let it go. 
Valtorix28	The last regionals I went to, my first match was against a female duelist. I shit you not, this chick was the hottest girl I've laid my eyes on and I had to Re look at the list to make sure it was her playing. And it was. To this day I regret not flirting with her more or something of the likes.
Valtorix28	Jim Carrey 
Valtorix28	Your mom.
Valtorix28	Oh my. Those look great. Thank you
ambientbagels	incredibly depressed since first breakup three months ago. need help to not feel sad everyday. | my first girlfriend blindsided me with a breakup three months ago, and i'm still affected heavily by it - waking up incredibly sad and losing passion for my hobbies sometimes during the day. being with friends helps but during the time when i'm alone, i feel so miserable. i started seeing a counselor to get help; and from social media/friends it seems like she's happy and completely fine, but i'm forever changed. i just want to be fine, and not still be emotionally attracted/attached to her like i was. it's killing me on the inside everyday and i hate seeing her face so happy every now and then when i bump into her on campus. any advice? i just want a day where i don't want to disappear from my life and leave everyone/everything behind.

slutforfamousamos	Am I the only one... | Am I the only one who dreams of something, good or bad, happening to make life seem interesting? Whenever I'm bored, I feel more depressed. Ever since I started medication for my anxiety, I've gotten bored much more often, and depression has come more easily. I don't really mind the increased depression - my anxiety is basically gone except for a couple of daily occurrences which go away quickly now anyways. I prefer the boredom and sadness to the constant, obsessive fears I had before that would exhaust me (this isn't to say anxiety is worse than depression - it just seems to be in my case. Everyone is different).  But now, whenever I'm bored and I start to become sad, I wish that something would happen to me, like a car accident or a medical diagnosis of some sort, just so that way I would have something to do or some excuse to be sitting around, doing nothing (some does I lack the motivation to do anything). I don't want to be hurt, but I want life to be interesting in some way.  I feel guilty for not being grateful. I really do have a great life. I'm a freaking figure skater, I have an amazing and supportive boyfriend and a loving family and a couple of amazing friends, and I know that not everyone can say the same. I just can't seem to see everything I've got, and I can't seem to see that my life is already interesting just the way it is.  I'm done rambling. Today just seems to be one of my tough days, if you know what I mean. Thank you for being there to listen, and I hope that this relates to someone or even helps them in some way (though I don't know how it would).
slutforfamousamos	Thanks. This helps a lot!

slutforfamousamos	Mold* not mild Rip
slutforfamousamos	What about family? Is there anyone you can call?
slutforfamousamos	Awesome! I'm glad to hear about that. I hope your second date goes as well as the first ^_^
slutforfamousamos	Bonsai from seed vs. mysterious mild stuffs | Heyo! I tried to grow a bonsai from a seed. It sprouted, but a grey mold/fungus overtook the pot it was growing in and it died. Any tips on preventing this from happening again? Thanks! (In case you can't tell, I'm a total noob here 0.0)
slutforfamousamos	Absolutely amazing. Do you have more?
slutforfamousamos	Actually, I have felt this way before, several times. It's usually when I've got a lot on my plate. The best thing you can do for yourself when you're feeling this way is reach out to a friend (or whoever the closest person to a "friend" you have is) or family member. Just tell them how you're feeling, and they might be able to help.  You're definitely not alone, though, and I'm kinda glad to hear that I'm not alone on this, either.
slutforfamousamos	This entertained me for a whole 3 minutes
slutforfamousamos	That's tough. Really. I'm so sorry about all of that. Tell your family about the brain tumor - the more you put it off, the harder it'll be when you do eventually tell them.  It sucks that your cat is dying, too. It sucks that everything and everyone has to die. At least she lived a long, healthy life though! It's tough to look at it positively, though, but 21 years is a really long time!  And, if I'm not mistaken, lupus is treatable in dogs. I'm no vet, but I believe there's hope there.   As for not getting paid for 300 hours... Why? That sucks balls and makes 0 sense. Is there anything you can do about that?   Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk more about it. I'm supposed to be getting homework (senior in high school here) done but  Y'kno  Reddit and the internet are cooler.  I hope this helps you out some! You've got my full support. I believe in you!

slutforfamousamos	I've been going through it for the nearly eight months now that I've been dating my boyfriend. It gets easier. It's slow, but it gets easier.  I used to get myself worked up to the point where I'd cry if he wasn't texting me back every five minutes. Now, I'm more comfortable with giving him space.  I hope this helps.
slutforfamousamos	Same for me. Yesterday, I woke up and started bawling in bed it was so bad. It slowly cleared up as the day went by. I'm on Paxil and i take it in the mornings. Side note: Has anyone else started on birth control and noticed that whatever anxiety medication you've been on doesn't seem to work as well? I've been on BC for three days now. I'm thinking about talking to my doctor about it.
slutforfamousamos	Take a deep breath. It's going to be okay. North Korea has been announcing 'successful' tests and threatening nuclear attacks for decades. Nobody else seems to really want to go to war, too. America (and co.) probably has the strongest military in the world (and a large number of resources). We've got the tech to stop a nuclear attack dead in its tracks, if need be.  Don't get me wrong, the news about North Korea makes me nervous, too. It's okay to be scared, and you're not alone. Just hang in there, and know that North Korea's got a bigger bark than bite. If you want to talk it out, feel free to message me. Talking things out that make us worried can help a ton (talking it out on this post is good, too. I just get frustrated over reddit's commenting time limit - anyone else have this problem?).
slutforfamousamos	Heyo I'm just a high school student and have never been through this, but I'll try to offer this advice: Take a deep breath, and take it one step at a time. It's hard to let go of control of these things, but just acknowledging this can help you to.  Focusing on your own well-being and making sure you're taken care of will help him in the long-run, too. Treat yourself. Do things you like, if you've got the time, and if not, find smaller ways to pamper yourself.   I know I can't offer up much, but I hope this helps at least a little.  
slutforfamousamos	Awesome! Have fun at your university! I'm a senior in high school so I'm getting there 😬 and I'm honestly freaked out about the application process/even thinking about being at college. Reading this helped me out, though, so thank you for sharing! 
slutforfamousamos	You can message me. I'm about to go to sleep for the night, but I'll respond in the morning. I wish I'd be able to respond sooner, and i hope someone else can help you until then. Still, you can talk to me.
slutforfamousamos	Yeah, no problem. Just take it easy, alright? This can't be easy for you, I'm sure.
slutforfamousamos	Any way you can call in sick to work/request a day off to get a refill? I'm sure you'll be okay if you can't, though.
slutforfamousamos	All the time for me. Sometimes, I go back and delete some of my previous posts, too.
slutforfamousamos	That's so sad ): If you need to talk about it, you can message me. I'm here, and sometimes it's just good to have someone to talk to. I'm not a psychologist, but I'll do what I can to help.
slutforfamousamos	I'm sorry Please don't kill yourself. You're right, you've got it pretty bad, at least for now. But if you kill yourself, you'll never know what good things life could have in store for you. Idk how long you've been struggling or how much longer you're going to, but I think you should hang in there a little bit longer, alright? Message me. You need to talk to someone. 
slutforfamousamos	I never said I had social anxiety. The diagnosis is just anxiety. I worry about everything. I have few friends. But I am very grateful to have my boyfriend. If you ever need to talk about anything, feel free to message me.
slutforfamousamos	I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm diagnosed and being treated for my anxiety. I've almost lost my boyfriend several times because of my disorder (he would argue that that's not true, but in my head, I know it is). I love him, and it has taken a lot of strength and courage to keep myself from overreacting to the smallest things. Just because something takes work doesn't mean it's impossible. And you should be careful with what you say, at least here. A lot of people on this subreddit could be sensitive to harshness like that. I'm not one of those people, but you never know who could be, especially on this platform. I know a lot of people come here seeking attention, too. But if they're going to those lengths to get attention, they still need at least some help. If you need to talk about anything, feel free to message me. I don't want to fight.
slutforfamousamos	How early do you wake up? During the summer, I struggled to fall asleep at night if I had let myself sleep in a bit. My mind would always race at night while I tried to sleep. I started waking myself up at 5:00AM and it helped.  I also recommend binaural beats. It's weird, but it might help. Just look up "binaural beats sleep" on YouTube, pick a video (some are 30 minutes, and some are three hours), and listen with earbuds. The idea is that the difference in sound waves entering each ear will help your brain get onto a better wavelength for sleeping and relaxing, as opposed to thinking and worrying. You'll probably fall asleep while listening to it, so as long as you're okay sleeping with earbuds in, you should be fine. It helps me, at least. Best of luck, and I hope this helps!
slutforfamousamos	Awesome, thanks! I never really thought of getting a massage, but it sounds really nice now lol. I'll check it out!
slutforfamousamos	Thanks so much for your response! Your story is helpful. I had no idea that Paxil and BC had caused bad reactions in some women. I think I'm going to wait a week to see if my conditions improve and then go back to my doctor and therapist if they don't.  Thanks again! It helps to know that other people have gone through similar situations to mine. I know this is probably weird, but if you ever need any help with anything, let me know.
slutforfamousamos	If it's up to you, I say go for medication. Before I started on Paxil, I was weary of going on medication. I didn't want to turn into a different person or become "numb". Eventually, however, I was convinced to start medication. I started on a low dosage of Paxil. I recommend talking to your parents and doctor about starting on a low dose - stay low for a week or two before going to a full dose. It helped me with everything - social life, school, sports. I was able to relax and be happy. I wasn't "numb" like I feared I would be. I didn't change into a different person. Instead, I was free from my anxiety - I became who i was always meant to be. See if you can talk to your parents about this. Medication isn't going to keep you from being who you are. Rather, your mental illness is what is holding you back. Medication will help, and I think they need to know this. Regardless, if the final decision is in your hands, do. what's right for you. Get medication.
slutforfamousamos	You can talk to me if you want. Do you have kik? I know it's a cheesy app but it's a good platform for talking to people online.  It sounds like you just need someone you can talk to. 
slutforfamousamos	Psychologists and psychiatrists will talk out your concerns with you. By talking to you about how you feel on a day-to-day basis, they can help you figure out if you have a disorder (such as anxiety or depression). When you're diagnosed, you can begin treatment. Here's the thing: psychological illnesses are caused by chemical imbalances. Therapy (talking to a psychologist and developing coping strategies) and medication can both treat psychological disorders. Medication works by increasing feel-good chemicals in your brain (I.e. Serotonin). This helps the brain to relax. Therapy works by re-training your thinking process.  No psychological problem is "fully psychological" or "fully chemical", and everybody is different. Therapy could work great for you, but so could medication. In my opinion, medication is the easier route.  I hope I've helped you out in some way. Do you have any questions about medication or anything I just said? I'm no psychologist, either, and talking about your concerns with a trained professional is probably the best way to get answers.
slutforfamousamos	* I'm not normally as obsessive over him as i was today. Today was weird and not fun. I'm just hoping tomorrow is better.
slutforfamousamos	Anxiety, Birth Control, and Relationship Advice Needed | I have pretty bad anxiety - i wouldn't call it severe or crippling, but it sure felt like it was today. I don't know why. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost 8 months now. Everything's going great, and there is nothing that I can think of that I should be worrying about. However, today, my anxiety has been bad ever since I woke up. I keep checking my phone for text messages from my boyfriend (who I know is busy helping with his brother - who is autistic and the sweetest thing ever). If I don't have a response from him, I start freaking out. Whenever there is a response, I feel relieved. What's weird is there's nothing specific I've been worrying about. Normally, I have a little fear that he'll break up with me (or I'll be stressing out over college applications, worried that friends don't like me or want to talk to me, and a handful of other issues), but today, I was just scared. I cried a lot today, and I even felt (very mildly) suicidal (which is not a problem I have had since early middle school). I am okay, and I know that I would never do anything to hurt myself. I'm just looking for answers. I've been on Paxil for about a month and it's been great for me. Up until now, my anxiety had been nearly eliminated. Yesterday, I started birth control. Today, my anxiety has been worse than it's been in a while. Is there a link between the birth control and the increased severity of my anxiety? If so, will everything get better once my body adjusts to the birth control (pill), or do I need to find some other method? Also, should I talk to my boyfriend about this? He knows I have anxiety, and I know he can help me. I just don't want to bother him if I don't have to. He already deals with so many of my problems, and I'm grateful for that. I know that this relationship can be as hard for him sometimes as it is for me, though. While it's completely worth the hard work, I don't think I should overload him with my problems if I can fix them on my own.  Typing this out here has already made me feel better. If anyone has answers to my questions or additional advice, I would be more than happy to hear it!
slutforfamousamos	I have trichotillomania. The best thing you can do is treat yourself for anxiety/depression, as it's a piece of those disorders (the same chemical imbalance in the brain that causes many depression and anxiety disorders causes trich). I don't have eyebrows or eyelashes, but starting medication for my anxiety has made my trich less severe. It's nothing to be ashamed of or worried about, and you're certainly not alone! I know many people who go to my school who have this disorder as well.
slutforfamousamos	I'm glad you didn't! If you ever need to talk about anything, let me know.
elvisjaggerabdulj	"Just move on", they say | I've been living for almost a quarter of a century and I finally realized that my memories are full of bad moments: break-ups, death of relatives and friends of mine, disappointments, betrayals.  They say you must not think about your past and just move on.   Okay, let's "just move on" for a minute.   I'm currently attending university and I realized that even though I enjoy what I'm studying, I will be forced to work a shitty 9-5 office job for 40+ years of my miserable life. Wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. Repeat this everyday.  Sounds exciting, doesn't it?  In terms of relationships. I've never had one. Well, actually I was going to, like a couple weeks ago I was getting to know this girl, everything was going well and I thought that we would start dating pretty soon, but then someday she found an excuse to break up with me and after like two days she started seeing one of my friends. So in such a short span of time not only did I lose what I thought would have become my first girlfriend but also somebody who I considered a friend, who instead betrayed me as soon as he had the chance.   I failed an exam because of that bitch. I couldn't eat for days. I couldn't sleep. She gave zero fucks and instead she would constantly post pictures on Instagram with her new boyfriend, making sure that I would see them.   But hey, let's "just move on". Maybe in a year or so I will meet another girl who would break my heart after a couple months. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?  "Just move on". All of my dreams and inspirations will never become reality. Instead, I'm going to live a miserable life just like any other person in this world.   Do I want this? No. Not at all.   "Just move on", they say. Why can't I stop here?
elvisjaggerabdulj	Your life must be shittier than mine, dawg
elvisjaggerabdulj	Nah man I can't feel anything but hate towards them.  I thought she was a nice person, but she betrayed me and words can't explain how shitty our break up was. Also i think that if you wanna forget about a person who has been important in your life you must cut all contacts with her/him.  There's no way we'll ever get together once again as friends, let alone as a couple. Now she's happy with him and I can't do anything. I just hope that in the future if I ever find a new girl she will be loyal but I hardly doubt it. 
elvisjaggerabdulj	100% right bro. Fuck a hoe and fuck her newfound "boyfriend"

Medication doesn't help. Family/friends don't help. Therapy doesn't help. Nothing does. I hope to die soon and simply embrace whatever the hells comes next. Hopefully, nothing. Hopefully death is the be all and end all of everything pertaining to consciousness. 
thefakesutten	it doesn't matter. It is what it is. Life sucks, so don't i. Sorry for wasting your time
thefakesutten	I'm just coming to the conclusion that i just suck and will never get better. just like everything else I do in life. theres no point in trying, honestly. 
thefakesutten	yea, yea, yea. Well maybe I can't improve. Maybe I just suck. Like everything else I do in life 
thefakesutten	i solo que, unfortuantly. 
thefakesutten	I wish I could choose the outcome. 
thefakesutten	I'll try. 
thefakesutten	And I've told you that I DO practice.   Fine then. If you know everything, how do I practice? 
thefakesutten	But WHY doesn't honing my skill fucking work? I mean, if it's ALL luck, then that means it really doesn't matter how good I am.
thefakesutten	So you're just another one of those douchebags who entered my thread to literally tell me they are better than me. Fucking fantastic. You can leave now. 
thefakesutten	Lol, that's bulshit. QP is a massive cluster fuck. I can't tell you the last time I won a game of QP, it's literally a massive circle jerk of retards instal-selecting hanzo and window, I don't take QP stats seriously lol. 
thefakesutten	Because people have no other rational reason
thefakesutten	suttini
thefakesutten	Too much effort, I'm on Xbox and I really don't want to go through that process
thefakesutten	Oka,y then he's just really, really, really lucky. I've practiced a ton and gotten no where. 
thefakesutten	You're one dense mother fucker. I've spent a grand majority of my time in OW in platinum, so fuck off with that gold shit. 
thefakesutten	What kinda hacks are he using? 
thefakesutten	Jesus dude, your point was that I never break out of gold, but very obviously, I have. Gunna provide those screen-caps, or was that really just an extravagantly stupid story? 
thefakesutten	Not when you're in platinum, I have yet to ever drop down, so, furthermore, I said up to 2700.... which is platinum. 
thefakesutten	Okay
thefakesutten	Lol, I'm not even in gold. Once again, making claims you know nothing about. 
thefakesutten	I don't believe in the story about your friend at all, dude. 
thefakesutten	And here's another person making claims on something they know nothing about. anything you say from here on out won't be taken seriously. 
thefakesutten	Because I AM learning, that's the thing. I'm noticeably better than when I started, for sure, yet I'm still in the exact same spot.   After months and months of playing it, there is no apparent improvement-- the game's fucked, my team mates always suck, and I'm beyond unlucky. Thats really all there is to it. 
thefakesutten	cool story, bro
thefakesutten	and you're making claims on something you know nothing about
thefakesutten	IF that's true, and that's a big if, then it also sounds like he has no life. 
thefakesutten	I've played well over 100 games a season, and it's not a mental wall. I'll be on a meteoric rise for a week, make it up to 2700 SR, and then  win 1 of every 5 matches for the next two weeks, and plummet back to 2400. I can be happy as a clam and still lose 
thefakesutten	And Ive heard the "you're lazy" before too 
thefakesutten	I'm not lazy, fuck you. 
thefakesutten	Well, improving's impossible. After 3 seasons, I'm convinced that I'm stuck where I'm at and not even god could change it. 
thefakesutten	Is there any rational way to explain why losing streaks happen? | [removed]
thefakesutten	okay buddy 
thefakesutten	Well, support didn't have anything to do with it really, i just kept digging and digging till i foundwhat was up so
thefakesutten	:/
thefakesutten	Nope. I've happily owned an Xbox one and a gold membership for well over a year now. 
thefakesutten	headed there now 
thefakesutten	On the support page? no. I have yet to try to contact them yet. 
thefakesutten	I can't get Xbox Gold no matter what I do | *SOLVED* I tried buying it with my debit card at first through the console, that didn't work. Then, I went to Gamestop, bought a gold card and it still isn't working!   I get an error code:  XBOS-XboxSubscritionInvalidSubscriptionStatesVNWOWG6AZ36wregcoUDJB2.9  any ideas?   solution: had an outstanding balance on my acc. because I got a new debit card, this suspended my acc. all set now 
thefakesutten	Smokin' dat dank
thefakesutten	Thoughts of suicide are creeping back in | I am just miserable. Here I am, typing this while at work. I can't help but feel like all I do is screw up. Every choice I make, is wrong. Every idea I come up with, is lame. I can't do anything right.   God damn, if it wasn't for my family I would have definitely killed myself. Its a shame my family, who wants me alive so bad, has no fucking clue how to support me or give me advice or consolidate me.   I haven't taken my medication in weeks and I missed my last therapy appointment and haven't rescheduled. Doesn't matter anyways, that therapist sucked. It seems like nothing is helping. Nothing works. I can only find one solution. 
thefakesutten	The only problem is, is when you call 4 or 5 running plays in a row, and every single one looks roughly the same, opposing teams get attuned to it-- especially when its a solid Defense, and coaching that KC had. McDaniels had some really, really bad play calling. I am not sure what he was thinking. 
thefakesutten	And youre a bitch
thefakesutten	I remember it plenty, but that was a different time and a different team. 
thefakesutten	N.O. C.H.I.L.L. A.T. A.L.L. 
thefakesutten	No, I didn't hear you. I read it. Then, I chose to I.G.N.O.R.E. it. 
thefakesutten	Calls me spoiled brat, then wishes me a happy Friday. Okay buddy, i hope you fall off that high horse of yours, and I hope your Friday is absolutely miserable, cause you need it. 
thefakesutten	And just a "holier-than-thou" old man who clearly isn't a true fan. 
thefakesutten	I think he's phenomenal IF he stays healthy. And that is a huge IF. 
thefakesutten	I hold my team to higher standards. Sorry your team sucks, now please leave. 
thefakesutten	Then don't come on this fanbases' subreddit, real simple if you want avoid throwing up
thefakesutten	The Morning After... | [removed]
thefakesutten	The crazy thing is, I bet it is true 
thefakesutten	yeeeaaa, this is a problem I've noticed ever since my very first post on r/overwatch. I forget exactly what I posted about, but the only reason people even came into the post was to tell me how much I suck and how much better they are than me.   The only reason I come on this sub-reddit is to get OW news. Occasionally, I'll try to make a "humor" post, only for everyone to come into my post and continue to tell me I suck.   This sub-reddit sucks and just about everyone in it is so stuck in their own heads and ego's that its kind of ridiculous. 
thefakesutten	Damn, thats wack. But fair
thefakesutten	What?? Really? 
thefakesutten	What is the most ridiculous NPC name you can remember? | [removed]
thefakesutten	I dunno about you, but I really miss PvE | Something about shooting robots who attack en mass is a blast. With this game, you can do it in such a grand variety of ways, I really hope they bring uprising back or add something bigger.   Maybe allow it in custom game modes? 
thefakesutten	well, i guess i don't feel as bad now...
thefakesutten	Is this even possible? 
thefakesutten	if i fits, i sits
thefakesutten	Coinbase has stolen from me. | Hi, on august 13th, I downloaded the app and invested 40.00$.  It is now August 28th, and I have 0 bit coons in my account and I am currently out 40.00$ still. I have sent coin base a number of emails and have yet to hear back.   Has this happened to anyone else? How do I get this resolved and get my money back? 
thefakesutten	Good! That means we will hopefully get it again soon lol 
thefakesutten	Ah, right. Indeed, another play of the game deserves this spot and I'm sorry I'm stealing your spotlight.   But seriously, I don't control others reactions. I didnt create 250+ accounts to upvote myself. Get over it.
thefakesutten	If you're so concerned about it, make the thread on whatever topic you believe deserves so much attention. So far, you're the only person who has said this thread is pointless 
thefakesutten	Well, you can shit on your team mates
thefakesutten	I totally agree. Furthermore, it would just give us more stuff to do in the game. There have been plenty of times where I've thought to myself "man, I really want to play OW right now, but I really don't want to deal with all of the online bullshit." PvE solves that. 
thefakesutten	Yea, I got Titanfall 2. It really is an awesome fps, one of the better ones on the market today. 
thefakesutten	It really does, doesn't it? It would add a lot of value to the game
thefakesutten	I could not agree more. 
thefakesutten	Yes, yes please. That would also make me really, really happy.   It would really add to the game as a whole as well
thefakesutten	Gotcha. I'll do that and then give my bank a call. 
thefakesutten	Maybe I'm confused. I just want some clarification, hopefully from them. I emailed them at least twice within the span of the past three weeks and have yet to hear back. I just want to know. 
thefakesutten	That would be really, really cool. 
thefakesutten	I know you're right but I'm not sure why its *not* good....
thefakesutten	Okay, well good thing you're not a game developer
thefakesutten	No. I never stop thinking about that song 
thefakesutten	yea it was a good tool for cooling down. The robots stand no match! 
thefakesutten	To each their own!
thefakesutten	I think uprising has been the best event so far... hopefully it'll come back for ya!
thefakesutten	I would honestly pay too, buuut i think you're right. If we ever do see something like that, I agree that it would be a ways away
thefakesutten	I'll take a look. It sounds pretty awesome
thefakesutten	Yea! Finger's crossed! My hopes is that, as the years go by and we get on to our 3rd, 4th, and 5th year of uprising/halloween event, we get new "episodes" or something to each PvE mode. If not, I'm still happy aboot it
thefakesutten	Never played WoW, but it sounds sick and i'm down 
thefakesutten	I agree completely. The stress isn't nearly as heavy, either.
thefakesutten	Yep. I hope they make it permanent in the future. Its a great way of enjoying the physics and engine of the game without all the stress 
thefakesutten	Yea, I think it would be pretty neat. Maybe, as the years go on and more PvE events are *hopefully* added, Bliz can create a counterpart to arcade mode that puts all the PvE events in an *episode* format. I think that would be really, really cool.  That, or a single player mode would be neat
thefakesutten	That would be sick
thefakesutten	Yea, that could work!
thefakesutten	I don't think it's unlikely, I just think its a ways away
thefakesutten	An interesting thought. I kinda like the arcade menu, but I do agree it could use a layout change. Mostly, because I think they need more variety
thefakesutten	Maybe it's in development? I dunno...
thefakesutten	That would be fuckin sick. 
thefakesutten	Yea! And, unless you where playin on real hard difficulties, team comp didn't really matter. So long as you had a way of healing, you'd be good
thefakesutten	Yea, pretty much.  Never played WoW so I guess I couldn't understand exactly what you're getting at. Either way, I'm down. 
thefakesutten	That'd be cool, but by that definition, wasn't uprising already a dungeon? It had the or-15 bots... though, there were multiple
thefakesutten	I'm not sure how that would work... what's your ideal image on that?
thefakesutten	I'm sorry. Hopefully we both find someone soon
thefakesutten	Yea, you're right. I just wish I had someone else to push me other than myself haha

BasicallyNuclear	Even though it's the point of the game, the people that will do ANYTHING to get you killed even if it means losing the battle gets really annoying.

BasicallyNuclear	Amen. Every time I try to talk to people I'm blown off  Or given the "are you retarded?" look (sorry if that offends some) I really wish I was given a chance.

BasicallyNuclear	Venus flytraps are suitable for eating, and can be consumed though they are a protected species and there can be significant limitations on what sort of harvesting is legal.  Many animals and other creatures consume them in the wild, and humans can make palatable recipes involving them if raw plant is not to their preference. Some parts are more tasty or appropriate for eating than others.  Medicines are also of interest when it comes to human consumption of Venus flytraps and derivatives thereof, though I do not know of any drugs on the market or in premarketing trials at present.

I never have had friends once in my life, mainly because I have no clue how to talk to people, I'm actually afraid. Every time I try to talk to somebody I have no clue when it's actually my turn to talk. When it is my turn to talk I end up accidentally offending them, thus losing any hope I had of making a friend right there.  I am really desperate to be able to talk to people and make friends, I'm very lonely. The problem is... that I don't know how.

BasicallyNuclear	I do hear that Delta is generally older (25-30?), having experience as rangers. Meaning they are more likely to go on a ground based assault and stay for multiple days; as for DEVGRU they are the hit and run type of unit, because it is not necessarily in their training?  Delta is [possibly] a lot more diverse because of the many backgrounds they have from being recruited from different branches of our armed forces. DEVGRU being only recruited from the seals isn't as diverse I'm guessing.  Not looking for a personal answer here or any type of classified info, I am perfectly aware of OPSEC, I just want to know if I would have to correct idea.
BasicallyNuclear	Thanks
BasicallyNuclear	If I am correct with this, you can pick out a delta operator by the black helmet?
BasicallyNuclear	So the first part is classified information. I would also like to mention that delta operators don't normally wear military clothing, but civilian clothing. Does that mean that delta gets more sensitive missions but seals are credited because every knows they exist after 2012? Just some speculation.
BasicallyNuclear	I'm not expecting them to tell me personally, I just want a possible answer. [This Image](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/476/686/5686476.jpg) is supposedly Delta in civilian clothing but, i am not positive this is entirely canon. [This Other Image](https://www.shadowspear.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/devgru-photo.jpg) shows DEVGRU in a full military uniform. I'm really looking for an educated guess.

Mike3939	I CANNOT stick to one hobby. And I really need one to distract me and to give me a sense of purpose. | Hey guys! So here's the deal. I suffer from depression and panic attacks very consistently. I have a perfect girlfriend, nice job, good friends, no physical issues, my own place, I go to therapy AND am on meds. But I'm still HORRIBLY depressed. I feel lost.   I've tried every hobby you could imagine and honestly many of them I even got pretty good at.  But inevitably I lost interest in all of them.    All I want is a hobby that will give me a sense of purpose in life, something that I can take with me wherever I go to help me with anxiety, something I can improve daily that can help me answer the question "what do you do?"  I just bought a piano because I thought it would be a great idea but now I'm just kind of looking at it with no reason to even want to learn anymore.   Help meee
Mike3939	That sounds amazing!!!
Mike3939	Oh no!!! We should start a club hahaha
danielms17	I'm hanging out with my friends now, I still feel like shit | "you should go out more" they say. Well, now I'm with my friends and I still feel like shit. And I'm high, so I'm pretty depressed also.
danielms17	I know that feeling. I mean, wasn't the same situation, but my entire childhood I used to make jokes to hide the sad, lonely and frustrated human being I was. I still do that sometimes.
danielms17	Yeah, when you start to realise that everything it's happening again, it's just terrifying, and there's nothing you can do, you just accept and wait, it's like quicksand.
danielms17	That's one of the worst, I don't have any religion, so I think you just sleep forever, but nobody can tell exactly what happens. 
danielms17	I have to believe that too, but for me, I feel that I can't leave this world until I have some impact on people. If I can't help myself, at least I can help others.
danielms17	My god, there's so many possibilities, what I could be doing, what I could have done, thinking about this just makes me more depressed. Probably I could have a girlfriend if I wasn't such a asshole to people in my life, if depression let me go out, or let me catch my opportunities. I could be reading books, making music, painting, making new friends. Well, I think that's the way it should be right?
danielms17	I understand what you're going through, last year I was in a severe depression and couldn't even get out of bed, then I started going out again, I thought I was better. After some time, my depression came back, but I was still doing my things, hanging out with my friends, but after that, I became really bored and tired with everything, and that's how I'm until now, everyday is a struggle. Do you know that moment when you don't even know where to go? When you have no sense of direction at all? 
danielms17	Wow, you can't even imagine how I want to give you a hug right now. Most of the times it seems that I'm the one who cares the most about friendships and relationships when the others don't care at all. I always want to make people to feel special, yet nobody wants to make the same for me, and it hurts so much. Once I gave a girl all the attention that I could, changed my plans for her, and in the end? She ended with one of my "friends". I say that I don't care anymore about what happened, but still makes me really sad. The same goes for friendships. Well, thank you so much for THIS, I really needed that!
danielms17	Maybe, and thanks for thinking that way. I just need to get out of this giant bubble full of emptiness. But what about you man, what you think you would be doing right now?
danielms17	In a world where people don't take mental illness seriously, I'm really happy for you right now!
danielms17	What is keeping you alive? | For me it's my family, I don't want to pass them this horrible feeling that I have right now, and my sister is only 5 years old, I don't want to give her a traumatic childhood event where her brother killed himself. And probably The Smiths :)  They have wonderful lyrics, who define depression and make you feel better for not being the only one with a shitty life. This probably are the 2 reasons for me, that's enough, I guess.
danielms17	Thanks :)
danielms17	That's terrible, I wish you the best man, I don't dream about goods things too, they are most of the time terrible and unpleasant dreams. I also think I don't express it enough, I could be doing much more things for them, and I already said terrible things to my father, I regret this until now. Sorry mom, dad, grandma, sister. Love you all.
danielms17	I'm happy you found your way. That's kinda strange huh? Happy for a stranger, and I thought I was empty. Anyways, I appreciate what you said man, good luck in this journey, and thanks for the kind words.
danielms17	When you talk about life in that way, I don't know what to think, I don't know if I'm lucky or if I'm doomed. I do think life it's worth living, regardless all bad things. However, I don't think I have any optimistic vision about this world, or the humanity. But I do really think the world is a beautiful place and animals, art, science, are incredible things, as contradictory this statement may seems.
danielms17	Well, all I can say to you is good luck whatever you're battling right now man. If you wanna talk, even how weird you think it is to talk about your problems to a stranger, I don't bother and I don't judge. I'm here
danielms17	I know that feeling, I can't even handle the idea of disappoint my family, after all they did for me, especially my mom.
danielms17	"you're not alone" means that you can be helped by other people that suffer from the same thing and that understand what you're feeling. It's a way of make people feel better, what else they can do? If someone doesn't want to be helped, the only thing they can do is give them kind words.
danielms17	I understand what you are going through because I'm on the same situation, and last year I failed because I was too depressed to do anything. This year seems like is going in the same way, I skipped a lot of classes and if I don't stop doing that, I'm gonna fail again. Probably the worst thing is that you know it's wrong and you feel like shit, and other people just think you're a loser, but I'm actually pretty interested in education, but this other part of me just don't let me live. So, just go man, I can't do much thing, but just go, make your parents proud, they don't want to see you bad, just go to the classes. You're not alone, this sub proves that. 
danielms17	Basically what I listen to it's to keep myself alive, doesn't matter if it's only for a short time. Alice in Chains, Nine Inch Nails, The Smiths, Nick Cave, Morrissey, The Cure, Radiohead, Nirvana, Fugazi, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Múm, Sigur Rós, Nick Drake.  When I'm listening to this, my life has no worries.
Billymazee	Pitfalls of speaking with a counsellor? | I've been clinically depressed and suicidal for the past 6 years, and I've scheduled to speak with both a counselor at my university and a private psychiatrist. This is the first time I've tried to seek help but, I'm not going to lie, I'm terrified of speaking with someone about it. I know the experience will be for the better, especially if I can get some medication to help, but I know that I cannot tell the psychiatrist (and certainly not the university's counselor) about wanting to die or my previous attempt. My mom told me that if I were to say this to either of them, I would likely be taken out of school and put in a psychiatric hospital, which I'd like to avoid if possible. If I can figure out some way to get treatment, I know that I've got a strong future ahead of me, at least in terms of career prospects and intellect.   Does anybody know of any potential pitfalls or topics to avoid when speaking with a counselor or a psychiatrist? Anything helps. Thanks.
Billymazee	As long as we can dress like [Frozone](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/475432884296101888/taaEMvVS.jpeg), I don't mind no capes
Billymazee	Loads of Sunspel and Uniqlo t-shirts (Supima for the 'Qlo), probably 10 pairs of PRL socks in black and grey
Billymazee	I have a few Sunspel t-shirts and I'd easily recommend them if you can find them; super soft, if not a little pricey. 
Billymazee	Embrace Lord Hedi, and he will bring you wondrous gifts of skinny jeans, boots, and leather jackets
Billymazee	This pains me as a McLaren fan :(
Billymazee	Watch the GOT finale again so at least my positions won't be the only things getting fucked
Billymazee	That shouldn't matter. A ticket is meant to serve as a penalty, not a tax. The whole purpose is to disincentivize speeding, so the fine should increase with speed, not income
Billymazee	Doesn't sound super nice tbh. Say you make £100k+ working in the City and get nicked for doing 5mph over the limit; why should you pay much more than someone doing 20 over on the motorway who makes far less?
Billymazee	I have all 4, just no other premium players. Still pretty optimistic
Billymazee	Gonna need some proof on that one bruv

Billymazee	I don't have any of mine, but [here's an inspiration album](http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=4841041.0). Harry Styles wears lots of SLP, so that might be a good place to start. 
Billymazee	I have those exact boots, and they're absolutely great. If you can, try them on in-store before buying because the suede will stretch over time; most people size down a half or one full size in suede because you don't want boots that'll be too big after a couple of months of solid wear
Billymazee	Just left London a week ago to start my job in New York. Terrifying to think that these attacks have now become more and more accepted as something to expect in my old home; makes me worry about something like this happening in NYC. 
Billymazee	I think the "severe" threat level has been in place since the 7/7 bombings, and they were over 10 years ago. Still can't believe I live in the same city where the Mayor says we should expect terrorist attacks because we're big, fuck that

Billymazee	Damn, I'm really jealous about Converge, that should be sick; they're easily one of my all time favourite bands. You got a favourite album from them?
Billymazee	Those who haven't swallowed the pill yet have to swallow it themselves, you can't force them to do it...    Uhhh, phrasing
Billymazee	Their cars are just epic. The new 720s looks a little [funky](http://buyersguide.caranddriver.com/media/assets/submodel/8095.jpg), but they are absolutely amazing to drive. Probably faster and much more reliable than the F1 cars at this point

Billymazee	Ah the classic inverse Cramer strategy. Someone should make a 3x leveraged ETF that just inverses everything Cramer says; we might just make enough money to start our YOLO HF
Billymazee	Henry and Neville have such great insight and tactical acumen that any other pundit is going to pale in comparison to those two. I'd wish Henry would come to replace Carragher more often; Carra can't go through one talking point without trying to promote Liverpool or suggest Gerrard was better than Scholes. At least GN makes an attempt to distance himself from his United bias
Billymazee	Do you have Spotify? If you do, listen to the FIFAP instrumental album all the way through, then listen to the full album afterwards. I think the instrumentals are ABR's best aspect (especially guitar and drums), so that might help you get a feel for their sounds and melodies since they sound different to most other metalcore bands. Then work backwards through their catalogue so you listen to the heaviest and grittiest albums last
Billymazee	For death metal, you've got to ease yourself into it. Anybody would probably hate it if they went straight to bands like Cannibal. Start with some heavier thrash metal like Slayer or Celtic Frost, then move to bands like Death and Morbid Angel. It helps to see where the classic bands got their inspiration from and makes the evolution less drastic to your ears. From there you can now to other death metal (Dismember, Unleashed, Entombed) or melodic death metal (Carcass, early In Flames, At the Gates, Dark Tranquility). A lot of melodeath bands inspired early metalcore, so you could also work backwards
Billymazee	I'm amazed at how many empty seats there are. It's European football in Spain, it's not like anybody's working or anything
Billymazee	Depends a lot on the jacket. I have a leather jacket from The Kooples that I'll wear inside if I have a t-shirt underneath, but that's mostly because the jacket is made from lambskin leather, which is lighter than traditional cowhide. If you've got a thicker leather jacket, you might feel too hot because of the thickness of the leather:
Billymazee	No we don't. I think people overestimate how important homegrown players are. Just because the Class of 92 were all homegrown doesn't mean we have the exact same situation now. We need good, proven players who can consistently put in good performances if we have any shot of getting into the top 3 next season, not inconsistent players who are treated more favourably because they're homegrown. 
Billymazee	Such a great album; this and The Melting Point of Wax were my jams like 8 years ago. Time flies...
Billymazee	The classic strategy is to inverse whatever the consensus is on WSB. All in JNUG? Better sell some calls and lever up on JDST. You'll be 100k up within the month, guaranteed

Billymazee	Thanks; I think I fall into the latter camp
Billymazee	This was really interesting, but I think it falls slightly flat since there were plenty of English-speaking Honda engineers at the races from 88-92. I know Senna usually had great rapport with his Honda engineers, so there must have been some internal change in Honda to describe this recent trend.

Billymazee	He's gotta be right behind Senna over a single lap; unreal how quick he is
Billymazee	Isn't it pretty obvious businesses inherently don't like competition? Consumers on the whole stand to benefit from increased competition, while only the businesses who would not survive otherwise benefit from this increase. "Businesses do not like competition" is a pretty flawed and slightly misleading statement to say the least
Billymazee	Great song, but largely overshadowed by the single This Charming Mané
Billymazee	Yup; I'd expect Carrick to play right in front of the CBs to give some extra protection against Lukaku. Blind will pretty much always get beaten for pace and Young is more offensive-minded, so Everton will probably heavily play out wide and try to cross into Trollkaku. Our biggest concern seems to be going forward
Billymazee	With the current exchange rate, it's about a billion Stanley nickels
Billymazee	I hope he doesn't come to fully replace Mata if we sign him. The special Juan's been ace so far in the no. 10; does anybody know if he could play on the left (where Martial generally plays this year)?

Billymazee	August Burns Red, Converge, Architects, Bring Me The Horizon, ERRA

Billymazee	Beta Decay... but also no autists of that caliber work for Blackrock or Vanguard to make a 10x ETF. MAYBE ONE OF US CAN GET ON THAT?
Billymazee	Plus he has a pretty fair balance of scoring home vs away (in binary, meaning it doesn't really matter how much he scores, just whether or not he does). I guess the dry spell he had (5 or 6 without scoring) put me off a little, because I normally go for more consistent players like Sanchez and Costa.
Billymazee	That's what I was thinking; you not bothered by Lukaku's goalscoring inconsistency?
Billymazee	Anybody thinking of Costa -> Lukaku?

Plus I'd rather not limit my trading to my phone; I'd rather be able to trade and cross-shop yachts at the same time
Billymazee	Never realised how much I need Robinhood until now | Charles Schwab charging $8.95 for every equity and non-Schwab ETF trade. HOW THE FUCK am I gonna get a yacht trading triple leveraged ETFs and pharma stocks with this commission?! Lesson learned, nothing but prosperity and the inevitable yacht maintenance fees in the future

throwaway37766	The realization that you're gonna have to die | Pretty much how I feel right now. This is my first time writing here. I feel like I could have at many points before, but now it feels like I have truly reached the end and there is nowhere else to go.  It has been a long fucking year. 2017 in general has been but I've attempted suicide twice in the last 12 months. Last October was a very serious attempt, and then in April was a half assed attempt where I took a bunch of pills and then threw them up shortly after.  I'm 27 now and while I have been dealing with depression and extreme highs/lows all my life, it has always been very fleeting. I'd have a few days of crying and then it'd go away. Well it wouldn't go away, but it'd be in the back of my mind and I'd move on and stuff. I was also never considering suicide at those points no matter how hopeless I was. It was something I thought about for sure, but at the time I never gave it serious thought.  In February I had some things happen to me that triggered a full blown depression. For 2.5 months, til mid-April, I was crying almost every day, stopped talking to many people, and didn't do much of anything. It was bad. For most of it I was only considering suicide half the time, and after my attempt in April I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't go through with another serious attempt until I tried everything possible to improve my life.  Well here I am. I'm literally failing at what is my last resort in life. I've always had another path to take but I am seriously out of options now. This was the end of the line. The only thing going right for me is that I am living in my ideal city. Everything else I am failing at.  27 years old now and every attempt I have made to change things has failed miserably. I try to make things better but it only results in making things worse. These last few months my goals have to been to rebuild my life here in this city that I love but so much has gone wrong in the process.  I honestly don't know how much longer I will make it. Days or weeks. My hole keeps getting deeper and deeper. My intention was to reverse all this by winter but things have gone wrong so fast that I don't know how they got here.  And I am slowly beginning to feel like I did in February. All this makes me wondering why I should be alive if I've pulled out all the stops and come up short.
IKazeTheWolf_	I never met my father. And no I havent forgiven them, never will after what they did to my sister and I. 
IKazeTheWolf_	I feel so weak, and pathetic. Full of regret and hatred. I want to die. | I met this girl during my childhood, we were both 5, so we decided to "date" even though I didnt know what love was til I was 7. (Dont ask why I was dating at the age of 5, I didn't know why myself ._. )  We were both 16 at the time. Me and her have been close and in a relationship for ALMOST 11 years. I went to my highschool, was a sophomore at the time. I had a horrible day. Just all these teachers were so horrible. none of them gave any fucks to anyone. students picking fights with me because they think I "Act" cool because im always quiet. What the actual fuck, thats a reason to pick a fight with somebody?! wtf. anyways I came back, was sooooo stressed. decided to take the anger out on the wall. Made a couple holes, kinda calmed down and panicked cause if anyone seen that whole I wouldve been dead( I would be fine dead now tbh.) I was so stressed, I called my girlfriend over. She came 20 minutes later walking towards my house. We talk, and watched videos. She texted her father, that shes going to spend the night with me. then its like... 11 in the morning (This was on friday) So we were just cuddling next to eachother while watching an anime.  Then she said that if im calm now. Then I instantly snapped and I punched the wall again, making another hole. I dont know if I have a problem or something but, when she said that it made me feel like I went through everything again x15. she was scared, I apologized and went to the bathroom. She knocked on the door and said if I was alright. I told her to get ready for bed. I was crying of how stupid I was at the time. I wanted to die just because of a single day of a very bad school day. I layed down behind her, holding her in my arms and she said if im alright cause i was still crying.  I told her that school was very stressful that day. I went to sleep, while she was in my arms. and then around 15 minutes (Kinda feels longer cause I was asleep) She asked if she could help calm me down. I said it was fine she didnt need to, but she wanted to. so, we did it.  Probably one of the biggest regrets ive ever done. right when im about to finish up near the end, I kept going. I dont know why. all I know is it felt so good so I kept going. she said stop once, didnt stop. said stop twice, didnt stop and then she yelled at me and said "stop" Thats when I started, you know. after that I was breathing heavily, and then I start having an anxiety attack. I was overthinking, like "Oh shit I fucking cummed in her oh fuck what am I going to do what the fuck is going on"  and all I can think about is everything flashing and the noises got distorted then I heard voices in my head. passed out and woke up in a hospital bed. I don't know what happened at the time. anyways it didnt occur to me at the time, til like a week later and im like "wait didnt I just have sex a while ago?" Called my girlfriend, she said I did cum in her, and I was about to drop the phone and have another attack til she said that she wanted the kid..I wasnt ready at all. Like il be responsible from now on if I have a kid... but if she had that kid, her life would be going through hell. her father knew about it and was STRICT AS FUCK. Didnt try to kill me though, just said "if you love him, then stay with him."  I guess I was happy.. Month later im at my friends party, drinking some alcohol. I don't know why so don't ask if I have a problem.. I didnt feel any different though and nothing bad has happened. I left the party near 2 in the morning or so? Started texting my little brother, whos just a year younger than me, and I asked if he was alright. while I was waiting for a text back, I stopped by my girlfriends house to see if she was there, asked her father and he said shes at her friends house. I carried on walking home, still no text. I start getting a little bit worried. I started trying to call. went straight to voicemail, and then blocked. so I started getting really scared. I ran the rest of the way home, thinking he was being held at gun point or some other horrible stuff. Walking upstairs, I hear noises. Not normal noises. It was coming from my brothers room, I opened the door a little bit. quickly walked in. and at this point, I wanted to kill myself. my brother was fucking my girlfriend. I ran out the door. Fell down the stairs due to me thinking it was a STRAIGHT WALKWAY.  Wish I broke my neck. I survived it, and I just ran away. about 8/9 hours later I get picked up by some Officers. It was a "Search party" for me. Which was a waste of time. was taken back home by my 'mom' Went home to check if my brother was still in the room, he wasnt. I asked where he went, turns out he went to his grandpa's house for the night. Im walking to school the next day with my sister. and I seen my brother, a freshman at the time. I started running towards him and I threw one punch and knocked him out. Went on him and started beating him to death, he didnt die sadly. I know its fucked up, Ive suffered a lot alright? Dont blame me for his reason of almost dying. Out of no where "security" stops me, I GET FUCKING ARRESTED, WAIT WHAT?! LMAO. fucking "Savior of the US" puts me in the back of a car to a little private jail cell thing, was in there for a week or so til my punishment was over SOMEHOW. I walked home. After I go in my sister comes from the couch and starts crying and she run towards me and started hugging me saying "I miss you" Shes the same age as me, we're twins, Boy and girl. My sister said I should come back later because our 'mom' was very mad. So here I am walking in the kitchen, instantly gets yelled at. "GET THE FUCK OUT" "YOU HURT MY BABY, I DONT WANT YOU TO BE HERE" He isnt a fucking baby hes literally a year younger than me. I got kicked out, transferred schools, and was homeless. Walked near 20 miles or so to my new highschool, and I was waiting for the weekend to end so I can go eat breakfest, I was on the edge of just killing myself cause I was starving to the point where it hurts. got my classes, went to eat, 5th period lunch came by, went to get lunch and then sit at an empty table not near any student, this was like a "loner" table outside of the lunch areas.  Girl walks up to me and I said I'd leave. she said it was fine, nobody really goes there. as she says.. So I started talking with her a lot. a couple weeks later she found out I was homeless when I kept sleeping in the park near the corner of the school. she told me she wants me to follow her afterschool tomorrow. So I went with her, met her mother, nice lady.  She asked me a lot of questions that went between 30-40 minutes. and then finally said, that I can live there. I was crying so hard and kept saying thank you nonstop. Then I passed out on the carpet floor.  then I seen somebody whisper my name, which was VERY FUCKING CREEPY cause it came from the dark hallway, seen too many scary movies to know whats going to happen. then my friend turns on the light and told me to follow her. She took me to her room, turned on a little lamp and said "here" So I said thanks, then I layed back on the floor in HER room. She was like "what're you doing?" Turns out she was inviting me to her bed. and I felt like loved again, 4 months later my sister somehow tracked my phone down just to find me, it was raining, I heard the doorbell ring and I opened it, it was my sister crying. Then she was frozen for a second, then said "Chris" and walked in and hugged me. I never realized I meant anything to anyone anymore. She told us a while later that she was being abused mentally and emotionally because she told our 'mother' that she was BI. And then I started to get heated really quickly.. 4 months later, while im waiting for these 2 slowpokes to dress out from PE in 7th period, I wait outside in the front. Then I started looking at cars, which lead my eyes to my 'girlfriend' who came off the city bus. I was going to just ignore her. she sits right next to me and tries to make me talk to her. then she said "Chris, its a girl, isnt that what you wanted?" (I did want a girl in the future) and im still silent. then she said that shes sorry and that shes stupid and how everything wasnt planned like that. She said she wanted to "start over" and "make up" I got up and started shouting at her. saying how could I forgive her for cheating on me WITH MY FUCKING BROTHER. Started yelling about more shit. then I yelled "why dont you just go fucking die" Started running towards the house I live at, looking back, shes crying and on the floor very red. Nobody was home, its usually me, my sister, and my friend home first, and then 2 hours later the parents come back. I started throwing glass. Started ripping stuff. Started doing all type of stuff. I threw my piano out the window, just put it in position and pushed it out. A lot of the keys flew out. I grabbed a knife out of the cabinent.  and I was ready to stab myself. all you hear in the background is yelling and running. sister charged at me and pretty much made me fall to the ground, she got on top and started saying how could I just kill myself, after all that me and her been through (Before my 'girlfriend', me and my sister would spend time A LOT.) And she started crying , her tears went on my shirt, and she started yelling at me saying that she knows life isnt fair and always good. but I shouldnt kill myself over that, AS SHE SAID. so I gave up and just dropped the knife and hugged my sister while she lets her tears run down. we replaced all the glass and ripped stuff. next day im in a bed. Got like 29 texts out of no where from all randoms. got a text saying "SHES DEAD CAUSE OF YOU" "FUCKING KILL YOURSELF" etcetc... then one of them was kind enough to say what happened. My ex commited suicide the day I yelled at her. I felt so heartbroken. I felt so lonely and depressed. so I decided to hang myself. Didnt really end well. wasnt tight enough, knot untied itself and landed face first into the floor. Passed out. Wakes up in bed with my friend, the one who I live with, holding my hand while her head is on the bed. After I moved, she woke up and said "Thank god" and pulled me close. I wanted to die so bad. She said she heard the news about my ex killing herself, but doesnt know what made her kill herself. after a while, fathers day came by. Got SERIOUSLY fucking depressed. Decided to try to jump off the roof. my friend, again, pulls me from the outside rooftop into the window into her bedroom. and she started yelling at me, saying stop. saying how I shouldnt be like this.  etc.  So I decided to change my life around. About 6 months pass, the day I finally talked to my crush after being very shy. Shes a very awesome rare kind of girl you find. We hanged out a LOT. then I asked if she wanted to go to the movies with a couple friends of mine when she comes back from her summer trip to paris, the "couple of friends of mine" were dating at the time but broke up later.  So I went to the movies with my friends, and picked up the girl I liked for a while. we watched movies, an action movie, scary movie, which was my favorite thing because she would get scared and hold my side. then an emotional romance movie. End of the movie finally. I pulled her closer to me, then she got up and said its almost 1 AM, and her parents just msged her saying she has to come home now. So while we were walking back to the car, one of my friends that went with the movies with us grabbed our other friend and said "We gotta go to the bathroom" Just so me and her were alone. I said "Emma, I was thinking, what do you find in a man?" She said a nice caring person, who was EXACTLY ME :3 Not really :/  Anyways it led to the point of me asking her out. She just, ignored me as if I said something. She asked if I did say anything, I said no after that due to shyness kicking in. So I asked her out right when we get out the car near her house. She said "Looks chris this isnt going to work out, I already like somebody" So I was like, oh yea...thats fine.. Its alright. I felt dead inside next day I asked how she was, then I was curious and I texted her saying "why wouldnt it work out" because im stupid and she already said that she liked somebody...so I asked more dumb questions because my anxiety started kicking in and I started overreacting then she sent me a long message "Who the fuck said I didnt care? How the fuck did I hurt you, I never said I liked you too, I never said I love you too. I never said something to you i didnt mean, but you're too butthurt to realize that. When you asked if I liked someone, I didnt lie to you, I even told you who it was" Im bursting into tears at this rate. Im wanting to die a lot more. Got in contact with her crush, turns out he likes her also, so I secretly told him about it, because I made emma, the girl I liked, feel stressful, so I decided to try to make her life happy as possible. Told her crush everything that happened between me and her, then he started getting closer with emma, and emma didnt realize that he liked her also. Then she brought it up in a conversation we had later on. She said  "my friend might send him a message saying if he likes me back" I said I know the truth, I said we both talked. She said "You told him I liked him?!"  I said yes, then it all turned well when I said he likes her back. then she says "Oh my god chris you are the fucking best" then I said "Yea sure I am..", even though I wasnt the dude that she wants...... then she said "Next time I see you im going to give you one of the biggest hugs I can offer" Without hesitation, I said "Save it for somebody who you actually love."  I wasnt pissed, but I was jealous. And now, shes lost feelings for him. So now I feel like I wasted my own tears, and time, and effort to try to put them together to make her happy. All gone. Ive lost my house, family, my EX, my future daughter,my crush, and my hope in living.  I'm crying over fucking love for fucks sake. Why can't I just die.
IKazeTheWolf_	Alright il look into that. I don't know why I'm relying on technology even though its the thing that ruined my life. My bad. I'll check it out.
IKazeTheWolf_	Im very new to piano, got basics down, I am looking for a site or an app to help me with it. | I already tried flowkey, so please do not suggest the useless site. Im 15, I don't have money :] Im looking for a website that can help me know more about the piano and possibly show how to read sheets. Nothing like "Get a premium account now to unlock the rest of the courses!" Just started 2 days ago. Still haven't learned anything new... (And yes I did read the side bars, nothing is relevant besides "what and how to practice"  Don't see anything that can help me there.)
samaraliwarsi	What do with so many regrets? | I'm posting for the first time here. Hoping this would fade away into the depths of www. in time. Maybe it would fade away from me and then maybe I'll feel better.  Each relationship requires us to ground ourselves. My last relationship with X (for this post) has made me bury myself deep. I don't want to get back, I care but I don't want to. I don't regret the breakup, I regret losing my identity.   I never thought I was special. But I had friends who respected me and loved me. I used to love roaming around in the nature. Hills and lakes were my places. New city, money problems and loss of a few loved ones changed me into a secluded person. I stayed alone just to avoid the costs of being outside. I had some money, I had the support of family but it didn't feel right taking from them at a point where I should be giving, and spending it away on my fancies.   Most of pain started 3 years ago. I met this girl and fell into this wild, crazy, out of the world relationship that seemed infinite. I was a fucking idiot. That girl and her issues have destroyed me. I'm no saint. I had my fair share of anger issues stemming from the constant mistrust, judgements and accusations. I let it go on, a relationship which didn't allow me to meet female friends, invite them or hang out. Worst, I agreed to send those friends horrible texts. Because I was tired of fighting and anything that was  remotely possible to help that felt like the only way out. I've lost the friends I sent those messages to. Some of those girls respected and knew me enough to know it wasn't me. Others had a knee jerk reaction of blocking me (I don't blame them). I started questioning if I ever had true friends or if I deserve anyone after succumbing to this. I did all things that would make me hate her, just to be with her. Maybe I was trying to prove a point that I don't suck at love. I've cheated several times in my past but never on X. Yet I had no trust. Maybe karma came to bite me in the ass and now I'm facing the music of the sons I composed. I've lived being called a sociopath scum, that its probably in my blood, egotistical for fighting for my truth and so much more. Every week, random things would make me listen to these things. X told me she would never have my sociopathic child in her body. I got angry, I fought but eventually I let it rest. X is a great person in herself but something about me just makes her hate me. So much that I don't deserve to exist, that I'm a scar on humanity and people like me should be burned like witches. Again, I'm no saint. I don't know who I am anymore and why I have let this happen. I have trouble speaking 10 sentences about my feelings without crying. It's all too much and I want it to go away. I want X to be happy and maybe just work with me(we've been running a company for few years). Everyone has told me to fire her. I can't because she has built this company with me, been there in good and bad times and considered like her own. I just want to have one week of work where I don't get her hatred thrown at my face or in front of clients. But I feel like I'm wishing for a fantasy. This won't change, my therapist said this won't change, my friends, family, everyone said the same thing. So what the fuck am I trying to prove ? that I'm a good man? That I'm not depriving someone of their work because I made a mistake of being blind? Or is it some twisted manifestation of my attention seeking (Remember I've been reduced to a lying, cheating, whore mongering, sociopath scum who only talks to women to have their attention. Who hopes for them to fall for me so that I can get what I want under the guise of friendship)  I don't know how to get out of this mess
samaraliwarsi	Yeah the 4k part might be the same. But what  makes those videos better is bitrate, log options and shutter speeds.
samaraliwarsi	Aegon's Conquest
samaraliwarsi	You mean after she fucked him on top? 
samaraliwarsi	A mechanical, Dothraki cuss filled doggy fuck as the Khal imagines his son mounting the world. And Dany wonders about why it has to be on an open field. 
samaraliwarsi	Now I wonder what he meant by mounting the world.
samaraliwarsi	Are you to trying to say that you play Universe Sandbox all day ?
samaraliwarsi	Dear neighbour, fuck off! 
samaraliwarsi	I saw your face and then my brain bitch-slapped me into forgetting it. 
samaraliwarsi	My god the guy has been roasted for a mistake. Let me just take the cross hair of your back. 
samaraliwarsi	Yuck! Sorry 
samaraliwarsi	Are you the guard ? Did I offend you? bolo fucking hooo
samaraliwarsi	You'd be surprised to see how many women like katua. No wonder you're not getting any. 
samaraliwarsi	Google's bylaws state that we are using their services. Google isn't ours. So google came out pretty much anything it wants. If you don't believe me, try deleting a place you added to the maps. 
samaraliwarsi	Someone tell me why this post exists ? 
samaraliwarsi	At least I'm not beating others and then telling them what to do xD. 
samaraliwarsi	:) Then my comment isn't for you bro. Peace out! 
samaraliwarsi	Oh don't worry. He's busy sucking a cow. I called him a Cow-ard on my way out. He smiled and sucked harder. Truly a fellow brother of yours. 
samaraliwarsi	As these questions - If he's been constantly let down, how often does he trust people ? Who are the people he trusts ? And what is his tolerance to lies ? (Something people do which he can't do anything about or something he cannot tolerate anymore and makes him sad/angry) 
samaraliwarsi	Wow I didn't realise this is such a political group. Bakchodi is supposed to be fun guys. I may agree or disagree with you but if this Bhaktwaad and Bhagwagiri and Modinaman is an everyday part of the group then you guys can continue. You've enjoyed sucking the Modi cock and, while I personally don't judge your choices, I don't think it's for a group called Bakchodi. You guys know best. I'm off, have your fun. 
samaraliwarsi	Yeah but it's an answer I know. I'm already using Fade In for a new script. But Celtx is lou so any fix to my problem would be best. 
samaraliwarsi	The last real fucking dragon. 
samaraliwarsi	Gravity didn't make him climb the window.
samaraliwarsi	Meh. He would have lost his head anyway and none of the lords of North or Vale would have given two fucks. 
samaraliwarsi	Any word on the newly discovered Black Hole's distance to Sagittarius A'? I ask because the orbit of a few massive stars around Sgr A' have been in observation for a long time (results published) and if there were effects of this newly black hole considered into the test of Einstein Equations on the orbit of those stars. 
samaraliwarsi	Why the fuck??? There needs to be a relevance test to these subs. Goes for r/dragonsfuckinganything
samaraliwarsi	The family that lived together and, almost, died together. 
samaraliwarsi	I somehow cannot type the asterix needed there. 
samaraliwarsi	That's what I meant. One body around a fixed body. 
samaraliwarsi	Using Fade In as alternative. Just really married to Celtx  at this point. I must point that yours isn't really an answer. I started my own thread hoping people wont suggest software options. I'll add that in description :) 
samaraliwarsi	Found a great series of lectures by Prof. Leonard Susskind and watched all of them. But that is a Stanford Graduate course lecture series and it is for students well versed with the mathematics (I'm assuming). 
samaraliwarsi	Any reference for a simplification of Einstein Equations? | I'm looking for a post/ book/ video series (best) that can help me understand in detail the mathematics of GR. I've been learning about it for a year and understand the consequences, implications, concepts used and how GR was born. The mathematics is too hard for me as I'm trying to learn now at 28, leaving math behind in school. So any derivation that, in detail of each and every notation/ constant/variable, describes the motion of two bodies in terms of Einstein Equations, would be great. 
samaraliwarsi	I want this in a grim snowy glass bowl.
samaraliwarsi	Funny!   But Snape is my love. I don't care about Harry Potter but that actor and the Snape that he played. RIP
samaraliwarsi	Still easier than master the left hand. 
samaraliwarsi	I'm not sure if Jamie is there on Arya's list. But I see a sad end to this character. He will have a big role to play before that I'm sure.  My wish is that he continue to serve in Jon's Kingsguard, an oath for life. Death or Kingsguard, since Casterly Rock is going to Tyrion, a bitch slap to Tywin (my fav character).
samaraliwarsi	Ros
samaraliwarsi	I think for Quantum Entanglement Communication to work we would have to have a particle at two places and means to measure changes in it. So in my limited knowledge, EM/GW should be our best form of communication until we can identify/ place a entangled pair in two systems.   And even with QE communication system in place, I don't think we can communicate faster than light. Because how would we know a change ? 
samaraliwarsi	Although if one has a guitar, he can rock into Mordor. 
samaraliwarsi	Don't mind but it doesn't make any difference what you do. This is a fun place for fun thing. Let's not take it that seriously 
samaraliwarsi	How to turn off default page numbers in Celtx? | The typeset adds page no's by default, does anyone know how to turn that off ?  Please don't suggest software options. Thanks 
samaraliwarsi	Change is the law of he universe. Plus how boring if life stays the same. We miss our past or what we used to be because we were children, better than adulthood any day? Eh?  We've lost our innocence, our ability to trust people and laugh. Back then a pink butterfly could make our day, because we were new to life. Trains were portals to a different world, the first love always stays in heart.   Now we understand a lot more.  Sadness is a very necessary emotion. Don't let yourself be bogged down though. You're the culmination of your choices and decisions. Be happy if you've made your own mistakes. Dance, I'd you've learned from them. Some are unlucky to not even get freedom to make their own mistakes. My point is, make more mistakes. Life will keep changing, make an experience of it. 
samaraliwarsi	Do all break ups post 28 feel like the end of the world? | Does the feeling, "I'm old and I'll never find someone cuz most people settle down", have an effect on our psyche post 28. Or is it always there ? In some way or another. 
samaraliwarsi	Your true friends will seek you out, no matter what. You won't know when you've made one. You wint have to run after them, or look for them when needed. Don't worry about the kids at college, after all they're college kids just like you. You have your life ahead or you. Don't let these partying kids and their ignorance bother you. 
samaraliwarsi	Good. Logic is good. Concentrate on healing yourself  now. Your emotions won't repair themselves. Maintain some distance with your ex. Let her be happy, be happy for her while you find your own happiness.   Too much happiness 
samaraliwarsi	Hey.   Reading this felt like I'm reading about my friend. She had a similar issue of disturbed sleep due to lazyness, inactivity and dysthymia. Her meds are still going on but the doctor has advised her to go out once per day for sure.   I understand it's hard to change what you feel. I understand that no one understands. But you do, more than anyone else. As crucial as friends are for  general well being, there are ways to go about without em. But it will be hard, hard to fight these feelings, hard to convey yourself and of course, sleep. I imagine motivation and joy to do activity is hard to come. Nevertheless, if you really want to sleep, activity is the only way. An exhausted body sleeps well, sleeps on time. And sleep will do wonders in your recovery. I can think of a few things to do alone,  1. Jogging. 2. Gym 3. Sports  4. Learn music 5. Go for long walks.  6. Cook for yourself, all meals. That punches in a heck of a discipline.  7. Help someone out. Feed the poor, or help a woman cross road. Make yourself feel good. Give it a chance.   I'm no expert, far from any understanding of psychiatry or psychology. I witness what you're going through everyday. And I feel your pain.  Will you listen to a mate from across the ocean and try one of these things ?      
samaraliwarsi	Congrats on your first draft. Go write another 6. :) 
samaraliwarsi	Wars have been fought for 'fewer', not for less. 
samaraliwarsi	Good man. That little girl needs her daddy. And that need is far greater than your need for justice/ closure about your partner. Its far greater than your need to die. And trust me my friend, if she (wife/gf) does not love you (no matter the cause/reason), she's done you a favor by leaving. An unhealthy relationship would have hurt you far more, even to your daughter, in long run.  If you were horrible, accept it. Sleep in the bed you made, face the music. Let her go. Words cannot repairs the damage done because they are just words.   My own experience -  I've been holding on to a twisted relationship. It hurts, everything does. I lied to her and then she treated me like shit (fair ? Maybe. All comes down to details). My only regret is not having a spine to walk out. Save her the horrors, save myself some dignity. She tried to walk out numerous times but came back at my beckoning or her own accords. We've broken up many times and for the past year I've been in a clusterfuck I cannot name. I didn't want to give up because that's what I did before this, gave up if a few things didn't work. But this time nothing worked and I tried for 3 years. Now I've lost friends due to it, relationships spoiled forever. I have no self esteem or ego left. I have no sentences to say to feel better no motivation to share and few people actually interested in my pain. I get by somehow. im just glad I didn't marry her or have a child yet. Two lives spoiled are enough to learn. 
samaraliwarsi	Thank the Gods it isn't 
samaraliwarsi	A lot of public places have cameras. I suggest you go for a walk in the city your story is set in. Look out for cameras. Pretty much all private properties ought have a cam in US. 
samaraliwarsi	Very funny, all comments. Anyone mind explaining how ? Unless its Photoshopped
samaraliwarsi	Far better than Rhaegar vig that shoe gave us 
samaraliwarsi	The fuck happened in 2015-17? There's a dip 
samaraliwarsi	Grades don't matter. Understand the basic concepts. If you need help, I would love to explain to you whatever is in my capability. To me seriously grades don't matter but the kind of person matter. And you've shown great strength in sharing this with us strangers and we will stand by you for your trust in us.  Motivation is a hard thing to find, I wish I could tell ya how and free of your predicament. I can tell you  though,  If the people around you make you feel sad. If the situations make you sad then you have left is yourself. Now in this state don't be anything that you don't want to be. If not knowing the concepts makes you sad, know them. If not waking up on time makes you sad, try to have a schedule that can out something important in the morning. Important for you.   You have to try to mimic the best parts of you. And j implore you talk face to face to friends or a doctor. You will feel better
samaraliwarsi	Water is the starting point. Presence of it doesn't confirm presence of life. But still, liquid water is essential. Its high dielectric constant makes it a good solution to conduct chemistry in. There are other solutions, but as we know, water is easily found.   Its ultimately the signs of violation of Thermodynamic Equilibrium that confirm life can be found. For example, earth has methane and nitrous oxide far more than expected.   And all that still does not confirm if the said planet can support earth life. 
samaraliwarsi	High Valyrian or Dothraki were languages specially produced by the show. It was done some linguist or language creator, whatever they're called. Apparently he has put up the lessons for it on his website.   I'll post the link if I can. 
samaraliwarsi	Those are the things he did for love, this he's doing for life. 
samaraliwarsi	He knows that Jon knows nothing 
samaraliwarsi	Someone thought it was a movie. I can buy the video game bit.
samaraliwarsi	Looks like Timon from Timon and Pumba. I'm honestly tired of this actually being a question. 
samaraliwarsi	Sure, if you mean Tywin. Oberyn...another vengeful, angry fool. Heck of a fighter and a brilliant character, wish they gave him more screen time. Then maybe best. 
samaraliwarsi	But Dany isn't the queen yet. If Jon can be King despite Cercie holding crown, he can be King until Dany actually assumes power. I guess. 
samaraliwarsi	Why isn't he King in the North ? Why warden?
samaraliwarsi	Aerys III right ? 
samaraliwarsi	Honestly this scene probably suffered IMHO. A side profile shot of Rhaegar Targeryan? only the most hyped, crown prince of westeros and father of Jon Snow. Gods I want a frontal. 
samaraliwarsi	Bollywood gas been the biggest film industry in terms of then number of films produced for years now
samaraliwarsi	So basically Bran can spy on a sex scene even when he gets to know the biggest lie. | 
samaraliwarsi	The films in Bollywood are generally okay looking. However music videos and dance numbers mean a lot to Indian films as they help in marketing. So most budget is spent on song & dance. This is a dance number and you can compare it to the film and see the difference. The producers somehow don't put as much in the actual scenes :( 
samaraliwarsi	Ancient spells are carved into its foundations. Until it stands, the dead cannot pass... I cannot pass - Some dead Stark beyond the wall. 
samaraliwarsi	Its from a bollywood film called Bajirao Mastani by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
samaraliwarsi	Sure why not call him Bilbo/Frodo while were at it. Just hope this doesn't happen. Damn clichéd. 
samaraliwarsi	Also so that Bran could ask, "so he was lying?" 
samaraliwarsi	I've never liked this sub until now xD
samaraliwarsi	Aren't all heroes in this show turning into idiots as time passes, or was it already the case ? 
samaraliwarsi	Well then. Samwise got the last few pages, so will Sam. 
samaraliwarsi	You try seeing it to know the difference. The budget was good for a Bollywood film but not the one on this scale, its an period drama epic war film. It is a bummer.  Same happened with another film called Mohenjo Daro, a film based on the Indus valley civilization. 
samaraliwarsi	Indeed a great prop
samaraliwarsi	Starks*
samaraliwarsi	A 100 thousand dead could break the doors.   Though I do believe either NK knew all along or NK didn't have a plan until Jon & Tyrion gave him one. 
samaraliwarsi	Reminds me of Shadow of Mordor
samaraliwarsi	Gods this needs upvotes
samaraliwarsi	"I am a whore remember?" Shae at the writers room. 
samaraliwarsi	Why didn't I think of that? Ser Mountain!, to the chambers.
samaraliwarsi	⛵ Ain't an option Ser Jorah | 
samaraliwarsi	Upvote this you idiots xD ROFL
samaraliwarsi	We have the entire plot and this kneeler still wants to predict. 
samaraliwarsi	Haha no!!!! But I know all theories. Brain is secretly Cercie's unborn child 
samaraliwarsi	Hey I've still watched it all several times over. Yeah ofcourse Jamie and this is a major issue. What I like about 7 over 6,5 seasons is that 7 has a good pace. I understand it comes with its pitfalls. I just appreciate a critical audience over an accepting one :) 
samaraliwarsi	#IF #NufSaid #WishfulThinking  
samaraliwarsi	From my own experiences translating books to screenplays. I do not expect a book in a film/show. There have been brilliant shows like GOT 1-4, because of self consistency. Not consistency with book. GRRM wrote the shows or not doesn't matter really. It's the output that counts.
samaraliwarsi	So basically we're being served with a rushed homework done by D&D, assigned by HBO with a deadline and tight production budget.
samaraliwarsi	I haven't read the books or anything by GRRM. My thing is based off the show only. And while I'm supporting the idea of a need for time jumps on a show of this scale, I'm looking for better writing from a show of this scale. I've enjoyed it just as much 
samaraliwarsi	I agree book treatments never do justice because they can't. It's a shift of medium. And I still enjoy the show. Believing something is dog shit and still doing it wilfully is not a new human behaviour though. I think we do that quite often in real life and it's not like a soul crushing thing since we know our reasons for doing things. To each his own I guess. Maybe that's just me believing it's dog shit but I know good shit when I see it. And GOT is awesome in its own way, I guess its just sad to see potential wasted. I shall make a note to edit that point, since what you say makes sense as well. I have no issues with positivity ;) 
samaraliwarsi	I don't remember him having a knapsack when he gave the Bravosi coin to Arya, changed his face and left Harrenhal. It shouldn't be needed, masks shouldn't be needed by shows own initial treatment. 
samaraliwarsi	I enjoyed it far more than 6. 4 Joffrey died so that just Trump's all for me :) 
samaraliwarsi	Yeah I just feel it was done better earlier. 
samaraliwarsi	Just being nice to visiting kneelers ;) 
samaraliwarsi	Thank you so much. Spot on! This the post title now
samaraliwarsi	I am :)

sad-alt	Don't know how to keep going any more | Hi I don't really know how to start this I just need to get this all down so people know what I'm feeling and why and if there really is any chance for me To get better and if anyone knows how I can be helped  I'm sorry that it's so long abd whiny and probably seems disconnected but every little thing adds up even though I know this will Miss out so much and things that I don't feel comfortable sharing  And I'm sorry it's written weirdly and I might make it hard to read I just don't have the energy to write properly and know that if I try to I

because of my dysphoria when I started growing facial and body hair it quickly turned into plucking and pulling that as well  But when the hair started getting darker and thicker I couldn't control how much damage I did to get them out so now my face is covered with scars from digging in with tweezers for hours every day I just wanted to be able to be pretty and confident with my appearance but now I never will be I always have been unhappy with how I look but during the times I hadn't got as scarred and stay clean for long enough I was happy with how I looked but now I don't even have that   I've researched stuff about how to get over trich but it's made for people that are plucking hair they don't want to lose For me I need that hair to be gone, even without OCD I wouldn't be able to live properly as myself when I have hair growing out of my face Shaving isn't good enough Nd I can't afford hair removal   I've spent the last year or more almost completely inside, so far longest time without stepping out once is six months  I can't be seen like this and even when I can stop and heal for long enough for makeup to help me go out it's still so hard Just being trans makes others see me as a freak, let alone everything else   I have no contact with my family who I ran away from more than a year ago because it wasn't good for me, especially my mum, who lied to, gaslighted, and blackmailed me, as well as sabotaging my chance of getting help from the gender clinic even if they didnt seem to want to help anyway   Ive tried different medications for my depression but everything made me feel weird and worse so I couldn't stand to keep taking them People say that LSD can help but every time I've done it I've had at best a mildly uncomfortable trip, but my worst led to me going to hospital and traumatised me worse than anything i can remember But I've taken it a lot because it at least means this life is different At least for a while   I've been in some relationships but I found out about something called relationship OCD that I think describes me quite well and is what lead to most of my break ups My last girlfriend was the first person I could see in real life and I always looked forward to her visits and she was so good to me but after the bad trip I lost the ability to love like that so I had to leave her And now she hurts too much to talk I miss her a lot  I didn't want to hurt her    I only have a few other online friends but they have lives of their own and can't talk to me much I've forgotten how to talk to people other than them and how to make friends I used to make lots of friends and talk to loads of people, even if only really online, but now I can't do it at all  I used to have a lot of electronics and stuff to keep myself entertained at least but even though I know to treat my things well everything has broken and I don't know why And I cAnt afford to fix anything I live on disability and housing benefits and what's left after food and everything being delivered goes to collecting trading cards because it means that I at least have something to look forward to and almost enjoy and there's always a chance of something good  A chance I don't feel I really get in any other area of my life It gives me something to focus on Even if my OCD makes collecting toxic sometimes And I get self conscious for feeling childish  But at least it's something   I wish I could save to fix things or get a laptop or something so I could make art again or play games but without lots of small things to look forward to to keep me going I would suffer a lot  I once saved up for a switch by starving myself and selling things that I didn't really want to sell so that I could enjoy something new but it and the replacement were both faulty and when I traded it in CEX took the trade in price down the day that I arrived there and then put the price down again because I had a screen protector on it so I lost a lot of money on that I feel like I'm not really allowed to be happy or have good things  I went to pride pretty soon after I left my family but I got spit on by someone there almost as soon as I arrived, and that was a long time before the hate group arrived  Feels like nowhere accepts me  I haven't made any friends since I've moved here other than my roommates but I did try  Talked to someone online and it went really well and was supposed to go to a meet up together with some of their friends but when I arrived they  all didn't say a word to me and after they finished their drinks just left me alone  And I really made an effort   I was supposed to move out last month with the roommate I get on with better but nowhere would accept me because I don't work so I'm stuck where I am and they moved out   The other roommate isn't a bad person but they had anger outbursts and pushed and broke things in the house when I had moved in not long ago and I never really got over being scared of her   I once attempted suicide But was found before I had taken many pills I went to the hospital anyway and said that I need help and that I think it would be best if I were to be sectioned  But they said that if I Kill myself it's my responsibility and they refused to help me  One of my online friends recruited some of her friends that are good at helping others and know what to do and are quite good activists and stuff like that and one of them is the reason I was able to run away at all But after a while they all seemed to give up on me  They knew how bad it was and said they'd help and then nothing I know they do a lot and I don't expect them to drop everything they do for me and I appreciate what they have done But it hurt more to be dropped like that than not told would be helped  I feel like I'm not allowed to be happy When I was a kid I got bullied a lot and especially when I was in primary school  Spent at least one year with no friends at all And when I did get happy or excited I ended up extremely ill Which i think still happens now   I once ended up in hospital the night before my birthday and I always got ill somehow before most good things  I was in college for a year and a bit I got a distinction in my first year but knew I wouldn't be able to cope in a level 3 course because I barely got through that so I took another level 2 in something else but I got kicked out because I couldn't handle it   A lot of the time when people try to help me they think I'm trying to be difficult and get frustrated and give up on me But I promise I do my best it's just that so little seems to work for me  All I've been able to think about lately is self harm and suicide Wanted to kill myself since I was 8 Only reason I haven't started cutting again is don't have anything shark enough  And usually too scared to try and kill mysskf  But so close to breaking point Don't know what to do   I really do try my hardest to make things better and I know my best isn't that good but I don't feel like I deserve this life  I always try my best to be good even if I don't always succeed  I don't know what else to do  I want to be able to be happy and be confident and go outside and be accepted and have s life and friends i can share good times with   I really miss going outside

mrnotnormal	Guys I need revenge advice really really bad!!! Help me help complete my life in the best way!!! Pm me please! | Thank you so much for reading.. I assure you that if you read this and help me, you will be glad. If you like reading about other people's lives, welcome. I'm just going to share my thoughts as fast as possible. Don't worry this is not nonsense. I'm very competent despite having mercury poisoning. 😛  You and I can feel bad for my 24 y.o sister to a degree but only before could know that it's bad to be psychopathic and sadistic. She grew up with relatively severe mercury poisoning at birth and through childhood beginning in elementary and middle school.. just like me. She was not capable of maintaining healthy relationships, had severe emotional issues and episodes, bipolar since birth.. typical for what I hear about adolescent mercury poisoning.. but she was pretty competent when she was 16 and onward.. she had a boyfriend for years after turning 16.. anyway..    So, I refer to my sister as a psychopathic and sadistic terrorist. She is obsessive with power and extremely bipolar. She's pinned me against the wall in my kitchen with the kitchen table and screamed in my face saying punch me.. she's chased me with a knife because I slammed a window while I was yelling and grabbed a belt as I was running away out of being totally fucking mortified..   Summary about my sister, she's the type of person who on a lazy sunday morning would take my wet clothes out of the dryer while its running because she has negative respect.., and if she's mad at me would not hesitate to throw them on the dusty dirty old basement floor. No exaggeration. People don't write shit like this for no reason. I'm 20 I have endless other shit I need to do besides write this long of a post about revenge.. i'm trying to tell you this involves unimaginable levels of disrespect and crossing the line and putting me through some of the worst conditions i'll ever experience. I lived with my sister and for 15 months she terrorized the fucking tears out of me. I'm psychologically and physically disabled and she used that against me to the maximum. She would threaten to hurt me in my sleep and spray nasty chemicals in my room while I was asleep.   One night she triggered me to freak and my dad the next week tricked me into going into the hospital because he said his heart felt bad and I ended up getting force fed neurotoxic pharmaceuticals for 33 days then I was homeless for 6 months.. slept outside one night when it was 21F degrees.. I was so cold I couldn't move.   I know this is messy but the situation is, my sister wouldn't let me go home to the house my dad owned because she threatened she would call the police if I went there.. he wouldn't let me come back just because of the problems my sister would make..   It was because sometimes my room would smell like weed. Sometimes I would take a hit, throw my extinguished bowl in my backpack, and blow a little smoke out my window with a straw... If she smelled any scent of weed, she would go in the bathroom, (because the door to the bathroom was right next to mine and there were huge spaces under the doors), and fill up a bucket with bleach and put it under the shower water as soon as it was as hot as it could be so my room would fill up with bleach gas.  The thing about this is, she terrorized me twice a week.. i'm talking like, tramatic episodes and passive aggressive shit that would push my buttons and start problems and it was non stop..  It was usually kind of unprovoked.   I have no idea where to start with how I should get back at her. I want to ruin her life or something.. I want her to experience the most terrifying or awful thing ever.. or something. I don't know  Comments or questions are welcome  Thanks fam
mrnotnormal	Damn it's relatable fam. I woke up and thought, "uuuaaagh" and took a fat rip of some trees. It's a lonely day for me as well. I wish I knew what to tell you. I could spend all day watching vine comps with high ratings on youtube. I don't know what i'm going to do today. I think i'm gonna talk to reddit about how I can optimize my life. I'm also going t download music on my phone and organize my apps and download new ones.   If you wanna chat heres my number text me if you would like.. 610-216-2650  Here's some good chill music:  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaobDRLzVWBpN-YI_7Ce-5OGzcQNpAo7Y
mrnotnormal	Hey do you have any silver fillings in your teeth?
mrnotnormal	I like to reminisce and I can't see how some of my friends don't smile or laugh when I bring up old good times however, i've had this notion in my subconscious for a while. Ever since I saw this well put together infographic about optimizing life, made by Anna Vitals, I never forgot one of the points which basically was saying you should focus on the future rather than the past.. Like, shift all of your thought into making new memories and don't think so much about the old.. and then I made a list of 80 things I want to acquire, do, be doing, and design and shit..   Now I long for a perfect life.. I imagine myself with a perfect SO, driving a Tesla, smoking all of the finest cannabis I want, flying around with a para or multi rotor.. having a nice large property living this life that's like a perfect dream and it's all dreamy and great..  And then I snap into reality and realize my life will never feel like a dream and since I have permanent brain damage to my front lobe, and improper brain development, and my face isn't perfect, I likely wont have a perfect SO..   And it kind of upsets a little extra once I consider how the years up until a great everyday life are going to be a nightmare.  So I can kind of relate. I just wanted someone to know my processing incase it makes sense and helps them. Lol, sometimes my thoughts are profound, sometimes they they're scrambled like eggs and cheese.  Also, now that I think of the way you see it, I probably will get sad when I start thinking about the old days. Ha oh well  
mrnotnormal	"Black Beatles" was playing thru the funeral speakers at my homie's viewing a few weeks ago | [removed]
mrnotnormal	It was appropriate since he was all into hard rap. Then they played Sun Is Shining by Slightly Stoopid
mrnotnormal	If Jordan was alive he would laugh out loud at that
mrnotnormal	Not a good idea man since maybe they know who ordered that at that time
mrnotnormal	Chill fam you clearly dont get my point
mrnotnormal	You're not making a clear point but i'll try to figure it out but what im sayin is.. if you're really fucked up like cranial maldevelopment+blindness+deafness+armless+paralyzed, then I say you really don't have much life.. but someone's who deaf, (not you fam), they have a lot of aspects of life they can still enjoy.., THEY HAVE LIFE ... and if I was blind, and I wanted to end my life, I would think at some point in the future that I was trippin because I would have been taking life for granted... if I was deaf and mostly everything else was ok, life would still be too good for me to wanna end it
mrnotnormal	I dont feel like explaining it but like imagine if you had OP's disease and you we were blind, then I would imagine to myself why you would want to end it, and if you were blind, deaf, armless, and paralyzed, I would imagine why you would want to end your life.. but if you have an improperly developed brain that still functions, or you're deaf but have a normal brain, I think you should live on and live for the good days
mrnotnormal	You should peep workaway.info it's the shit man
mrnotnormal	Yea since I think I may be able to relate. My nose is really crooked fam and thats 1 of the 30 things that I would think about when I used to contemplate suicide. Now I moved on from that and I have amazing days all the time even though there are like 30 aspects of my life that are really fucked up.
mrnotnormal	Which is soon
mrnotnormal	Man i'm glad this isn't shit I plot to do! Too much planning and risk and anxiety for me to go for the pricey stuff
mrnotnormal	Yea I mean unless you know who the undercover LPs are and you stay away from stores that have tinted camera covers. But thats still too risky! You would have to read up to make sure there arent any articles about a recent theft at that particular spot and that goes for every spot
mrnotnormal	And my teeth are going to be crooked for the rest of my life since my jaw joint can never be corrected. But i've accepted that 
mrnotnormal	I read that some Apple stores have undercover LP so, I would need to find one out of town (so if I get booked there's a better chance my name wont be in my local paper), that I could park in front of with a dash cam.  On a side note, I read a few people saying that they do not conceal when scoring at an Apple store.. what's up with that?
mrnotnormal	Yea
mrnotnormal	To my bank account?
mrnotnormal	Is there a way to trigger a double order when ordering an item online? | It has happened to me accidentally with $150 skullcandy headphones and $80 boots
mrnotnormal	When Boonk Gang disrupts church | 
mrnotnormal	DAE: prefer to scroll or read in the opposite direction when reading a list, as in reading from the bottom to top? | 
mrnotnormal	Us if we reincarnated into a seagull
mrnotnormal	If you wouldn't mind giving me revenge advice via PM, please PM me! I am desperate for help! | [removed]
joskinny	For the last time | I'm done. Every time before Ive been here I thought it was it then but this time I know I don't have anything left to live for  I'm disabled and can barely work/study   I can't live with my parents they're toxic  I'm trans and my friends won't even acknowledge it they're my best friends in the world and they still think I'm sinning   I think God has abandoned me and I don't know why   My one thing that kept me alive for impossibly long which was writing music about my struggles is coming to an end I can feel it. No one's ever going to hear it. No one's ever going to care. I don't have money to record it and the only thing stopping me is that it will die with me   I'm a worthless failed human being. There's nowhere I feel safe and loved and it's only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I used to believe a miracle could save me but not any more  If anyone wants to try to talk me down go for it but I don't think it's gonna work. What can you say that I haven't already tried on myself? 
joskinny	I feel like every bit of temporary happiness I feel is worse punishment than the pain I'm in | Nothing ever sticks around. People leave me or ignore me or pretend they don't care. Whenever I feel one good thing it immediately gets even worse right afterward. This is torture. I dont care if I kill myself because I'm already in hell
joskinny	You're not a piece of shit. I'm a trans guy and I feel a lot of the same ways. Stuck with no life left to live. It sucks so bad 
joskinny	Fuck this society. I'm dealing with similar shit 
joskinny	These are amazing, thank you for sharing!
joskinny	talked about life, death, music, and not being alone. | I hope you are doing a little bit better. it was truly nice to talk to you. I don't know if you disconnected or the website did, but if you ever want to talk again, let me know.   anathema, twenty one pilots  the end, mcfly
joskinny	Trees, for me, is somehow the song that encompasses exactly what twenty one pilots means to me. Every time I think of seeing them live it's that song I want to be a part of most. I hope they keep closing with it on emotional roadshow.
joskinny	I have one if you're still looking!
joskinny	[SELLING] 1 ticket for Norfolk at the Norva, Dec 1, $80 but will negotiate what you can afford | Hello, won't be able to make the show so selling my ticket. I'd like to get some money back but I'm willing to negotiate bc I know we aren't all made of money. Have pdf ticket that I will email you. Comment or message if interested!
joskinny	I really like Human Again
joskinny	This is really good, thanks for sharing, yo. I can't think of anything to say criticism wise, other than like, it seems you've thought a lot about these words. Keep writing! |-/
joskinny	How else do you deal with it then?
joskinny	I've been lane boy and bean a couple time each
joskinny	I don't know if this is just depression for you or something else, but I (having depression) can definitely relate to a lot of what you just said. The constant pain, always there. The whole, always feeling like you have to put on an act.. you could have described my life. It just feels so grating every second, like I'm living this lie and it's so isolating because no one can break through to you or wants to anyway and they don't care about you just this idea of you that can do stuff. It sucks, maybe the worst part. I don't know.  Anyway. Like I said, I can't say whether that's just depression for you - maybe someone else here knows that it could be caused by someone else as well. But at least I can tell you you're tnot the onlhy one. Idk if this gets better, wish I could say it did. If you want some music I can recommend you some good stuff that helped me, sort of. But I hope you figure this out, friend. 
joskinny	YES. There's about four mental health 'advocacy' groups at my college and all they do is give out free cookies and remind people it's important to be happy, and write meaningless things on the sidewalk, and crap like that. My point is, people think that calling yourself aware is enough. Someone posting a post or wearing a wristband means nothing to me when I'm feeling at my worst. Hashtags don't cure this isolation. Letting go of balloons gives me no additional reasons to want to live. Most of the people who will do these things won't be around for someone when they're needed (or will just tell them 'stay for me', 'it's not that bad'), won't act to make it easier for mentally ill people to get accommodations they're constantly denied, or to change the aspects of society that make mental illness perpetuate itself, the things that are proven to cause it in the first place. Most people wouldn't talk to me about my struggles if I offered to tell them everything. They think that awareness means "oh, mental health problems exist." and that's it. After that it's our problem. They can sweep it under the rug after they make their self-affirming facebook post, because they don't have to deal with it day to day. That's the stigma right there. We just have to keep functioning as always, pressure's on us to act normal and nothing changes. They think they know everything. They truly have no idea. On better days I have half a mind to tell these groups, look, sit me out there at table and I'll yap until everyone's ears bleed about how much I hate having no escape from my own mind, and there's your mental health awareness. Don't say you care, then don't. That's false hope, and it's worse than no hope at all.  (edit:grammar)
joskinny	twenty one pilots. They do a lot of songs about dealing with this stuff. Relatable. Just this sort of honesty about the whole thing. One of the big reasons I'm still fighting.
joskinny	this one http://i.imgur.com/LbrjZHM.gif makes me think of being in the rain leaving theatre rehearsal, with all the artistic creativity and such flooding my brain and that sort of magical, bigger-than-this-dull-reality kind of feeling. Like the excitement of creating or building something, like a single streetcorner contains something massive and interesting. Takes me away from the distressing reality that is my life and makes me think that better experiences are possible. Thanks. 
joskinny	As a black woman, Effie Brown has had to deal with racism and sexism firsthand, where Matt Damon hasn't, as a white man. As a result, he doesn't understand firsthand like she does why it's important to have diverse representation in film: because if you're a minority, you don't see many characters like you in media (if you look at most movies and tv shows, the majority of characters are white straight cisgender able-bodied guys). This can damage your self esteem by making you believe subconsciously that you aren't as capable as someone privileged (ie white, male, etc), and it can leave you with a lack of fictional characters that you relate to that can be role models. In short, it deepens the feeling of unwelcomeness in society that's caused by a history of racism.   Unlike Effie Brown, Matt Damon doesn't have the experience to understand all that - which is not terrible on its own, but the problem here is that he talked over her and basically decided that he was the authority on something that he had less actual experience in than she did, which is arrogant and rude. It's racist because it basically just builds on years of black people not being able to have the same level of opportunities in society, and he should have tried to learn from her and support her attempts to fix that, instead of acting in a way that reinforces it. 
joskinny	I'm with you there. Sophomore too, physics major, barely holding it together. It got really bad last year and I did basically none of my homework, took one look and didn't understand and crying and trying to get some sleep was easier.  I've always been the kind of person who puts things off too, but there comes a point where the energy to keep doing that, the motivation or whatever, just kind of fades and you don't have anything to replace it with because you never did anything differently... and that would be if you didn't have to put up with crushing depression feelings hour in and hour out... and you feel like you're stuck in this loop of too tired to do anything, too lost to change anything, and it just keeps going...  I kind of took a step and fell flat on my face so to speak this semester, but I'm trying to do some stuff like going to office hours and all... I think I've got a handle on some of the stuff but maybe that's just this week... who can tell... 
joskinny	Yeah. I get distorted thinking to the point where if I do anything wrong I'm convinced I'm a terrible person and I hate myself. If I make a decision I regret, even if it's small or doesn't affect anyone else, I find it really hard to live with myself for a while. I used to think it was anxiety, but now I'm pretty sure it's depression distorting my thinking.
joskinny	I just want to tell you that I hear you, that you're not alone on here, and that this isn't your fault. I've been in some of the same places - loneliness, feeling replaced by another friend by my own sister, feeling isolated like you don't know who to turn to? yeah, that's one of the hardest parts. I know it's also really tough in high school bc you haven't figured out how to take care of yourself yet, and the people around you don't always know what's best for you. I wish I could fix all your problems for you, but the best I can do is tell you you're not the only one and it's ok to not be ok.   From my experience - though the fact that I'm on this subreddit is evidence enough that I'm still stuck in depression myself, so take this with a grain of salt - it's best to listen to your emotions and try to see if you can figure out what they're saying over time... which you seem to be doing... trying to push them down inside you may help a bit for a while but they'll just come back.  And I would say think about talking to your sister, at least about some of it. Just tell her that it's not her fault - you just thought she should know because y'all are close. I know you don't want to worry her, but you're already down this path whether you tell her or not, and it's better to have someone on your side with this kind of stuff - both so you're less alone, and so she knows what's going on.
joskinny	Existential depression, yay... I'm stuck in a combination of levels 2 and 3 and (maybe) a little bit of 4 right now. Ran into Dabrowski a few weeks ago and his was the first model (psychological or philosophical) that actually seemed to make sense to me. I've been stewing around with the same ideas for a few years, of how I don't get why I have to do the stupid crap that everyone just tells me is "just how it is", and how I've known  that something's off, that it stresses me out to do things in what I perceive to be the "wrong way" by ideals no one else seems to see... and dear Dabrowski managed to explain my horrible horrible indecision complex too... Anyway, it was really great to find something that made sense, and, here, to find people to whom it also made sense, so thanks for posting, immensely... The point of this all is that we're supposed to find our own way, I guess, but it's nice to have someone to meet up with along the way.   Side notes: I wish I knew what it's like to get to level 5. I'm kind of stuck in a superposition of several levels and have definitely fallen back at least once, when no one around me was listening and it was too difficult to not deal with my day to day bores... anyone else like that too? It's like I've solved enough of some of level 2 to start asking the level 3 questions, but not enough to resolve the first conundrums - still trying to build up mental energy enough to fully commit to listening to my own values, and reworking my instincts to match, while not quite sure what those values are... though upon reviewing the Wikipedia article, it's come to my attention that I've sort of been building up to a crisis moment I had last week during which I sort of snapped and confronted a problem in a way I never would have back when I was still completely listening to social mores... real dramatic moment, I was literally crying in the rain and all. Perhaps I'm closer to the end of level 2 than I thought, hmm. Or maybe not. It's really hard to tell with these things.
joskinny	I don't know, been wondering the same thing myself, between an artistic pursuit and a scientific one... maybe you'd get down the road of becoming a doctor, and the crisis of denying yourself a creative outlet would get worse and worse (bc once it's started it doesn't really go away in my experience) and you'd get to the point where you'd have to change directions or be miserable. Maybe the only way for any of us (especially those who are so much aware of all this meaning stuff) to contribute the best to society is for us to follow what makes us happy as individuals. We've only got one life each and we're more than pieces of the puzzle and you deserve to be happy too.

He jumped 19 floors to his death, without a note, without any sort of warning.  I will never forgive myself for not being able to help, even though we were on different continents.  I want to die and be with him.  My parents are destroyed... how can he do this? I want to be with him, but I can't do this to my parents for a second time... I'm all they have left.  Please, please tell me he's waiting on me to end this life and join him.  I can't build the courage to end it all.  I climbed up onto a window tonight, but it was only one storey and I became frightened.  I am pathetic and weak.  I just want to be with my brother, even though I adore my parents, partner and family.  Please somebody give me reason to live... reason to carry on.  I just want my brother. Help.
rapsputical	I hate being alive. | I have various tabs open at the moment for suicide... not that I am going to kill myself. I wouldn't do that; I couldn't do that.  Just... sometimes I feel like it's the only option for me, to stop having to feel this way All. The. Fucking. Time. I am so tired of everything. Tired. T i r e d.  I know other people have it worse than me, believe me, I do. But you have to appreciate that I have been unhappy and lonely my entire life; I've reached the point where I'm just done about with it. It's not like I've befallen some terrible tragedy and this is the climax of my story, the point where I look starry-eyed at the sunset, make a heartfelt decision, and eventually overcome this great adversity and ultimately grow as a person. No, that bullshit only exists in movies because, in truth, life constantly corrodes away you. My soul feels as though it is envoloped by this black poison, worn down and cracked to the point where this horrible ink just seeps out over anything I touch.  Nothing good in my life lasts; it doesn't take long before the good becomes contaminated. I can't enjoy my successes, because the poison warps them into failures. I can't have functional relationships, because the poison reminds me that nobody could ever like the real me. I can't even get help, because the poison constantly makes me feel like I don't deserve it.  Something as toxic as myself should just rot.
Throwaway07031212	Im sad | I cant remember anytime Ive truly been happy. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that my family would be destroyed if I killed myself, and that my brother is gonna probably end his life if Im not there for him.
TheLostActuary	You ever wish you were 80 years old just so your life is almost over? I do. | 
TheLostActuary	Score | Is there a way to find out my exact score if I failed my test?
TheLostActuary	Substitutions when baking | I am baking a Pillsbury cake and on the back it tells me I can substitute the Greek yogurt for eggs, or applesauce for oil. My question is, can I do both substitutions? Or do I have to choose between the two?
TheLostActuary	I think the confusion comes from the fact that, the way you worded it sounds like you guessed on 3/4 of the test. But I think you mean you only guessed on 3 or 4 problems
TheLostActuary	PV of an Annuity Immediate | I am memorizing formulas right now and I know that PV of an annuity immediate can have the formula:  (1-v^n)/i  I also have another formula written down, but I am unsure how it is meant.   I can't tell if it is:  (A due angle n) * (1-d)  or  A due angle n evaluated at 1-d  Can anyone help me out?  PS please don't respond if you are just going to tell me to learn the calculator method because I already know it, I am trying to learn formulas for convenience sake.
TheLostActuary	How many chances do employers give you | To my understanding, once you get a job as an actuary, they expect you to keep passing exams, and from what I have read, they give a limited time frame. How many chances, or how long of a time frame do your employers give you to pass each exam. Does it vary between tests? Or is it a straight, "we give you 9 months to pass the each exam"?
TheLostActuary	Yes, but because I had forgot to put what test I was taking, no one answered the question
TheLostActuary	ADAPT vs TIA practice exam vs Real Exam for FM | I have the TIA software for FM, but I see a lot more posts about the ADAPT scores compared to the real exam than TIA to the real exam. What would you say the equivalent ADAPT score is compared to the TIA practice exams? And if you would like to answer, how is the TIA practice exams vs the real exam? Was it easier, harder? Right on par?
TheLostActuary	FM
TheLostActuary	ADAPT vs TIA vs Real Exam | I have the TIA software, but I see a lot more posts about the ADAPT scores compared to the real exam than TIA to the real exam. But what would you say the equivalent ADAPT score is compared to the TIA practice exams? And if you would like to answer, how is the TIA practice exams vs the real exam? Was it easier, harder? Right on par?
TheLostActuary	I've already bought the subscription for the whole TIA course so I am not going to spend more money on other programs. I was just wanting an insight on how these were against the real exams
TheLostActuary	The Infinite Actuary for FM | I know this is probably on here several other times, but the only ones I have found are from years ago so I would like some updated answers. How are the TIA practice exams compared to the actual exam? Is there anything on the real test that TIA didn't put much emphasis on? Which exams on FM did you find to be the most challenging? And anything else you would like to add about the TIA practice exams
TheLostActuary	FM on the job? | I really loved studying for FM, I find it all fascinating and much more enjoyable than P. Do you use much of the stuff you study in FM on the actual job, or things like it? If so, which job track deals with it the most?
TheLostActuary	Integration? | When you guys took the FM exam, did you get questions that involved integration? If so, how many?
TheLostActuary	I think Nothwestern does have Actuarial jobs, but only at their headquarters, so I'm not sure my experience with them would help or if I want to move that far North
TheLostActuary	I actually have already bought TIA both Fm and P. I thought the FM was great. But I feel like Dave in the P glosses over things very quickly and it's hard for me to understand. That's actually why I went about making this post
TheLostActuary	I am a finance major so maybe that is why it clicks a little more for me than the stats and calc, even though in general I do love math. But I haven't had those classes for a few years and I honestly dont remember much. Its probably why it doesn't click
TheLostActuary	A while since I've taken Calc | I am in college and I decided on an actuarial career path my senior year (this year). I am a finance major, so naturally I decided to study for FM first. Now I am starting to study for P. I love math but its been a few years since I've taken Calc or stats, and even then I only got through 1 and a half semesters of Calc. I don't have any semesters left to take more courses. What should I do?
TheLostActuary	To anyone who has used The Infinite Actuary | I started studying with the infinite actuary back in October for my FM exam and I loved it. Naturally when I started studying for exam P I decided to use it again. Well I don't know if I just don't have as much background with statistics as I do with financial math, but I don't understand it at all. When I was studying for FM, I felt like James was really explaining everything in a lot of detail....maybe even too much detail at times, but I liked it that way because I knew every step he was taking and why. I find the P seminar to be much different. I feel like he starts skipping steps because he assumes the audience knows what they are doing and doesn't go into as much detail as to why we are doing what we are doing.  I guess my question is, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you pass the actual exam? Did you have to use other resources? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
TheLostActuary	FM Non-Computational Problems | I will be taking the FM in a few weeks and I am using the infinite actuary. Their practice exams have a few questions that are straight forward multiple choice questions that require no math, formulas, or computing. Is this the case with the real exam?
TheLostActuary	Jobs after graduation | I am a senior in college and will be graduating this May. The start of this school year is when I decided I wanted to become an actuary, so I never got the chance to get an internship directly related to actuarial science, even though I did have an internship through Northwestern Mutual. I plan on applying to entry level positions as well as internships. The only problem with the internships is, most that I have been seeing are looking for current college and grad students. Do you guys know of any companies that hire interns that are no longer students?

Fat_mongoose	Teenage acne. | Around the age of 14 i started developing severe cystic acne on only one side of my face, i was a normal sociable kid before then but acne caused me to spiral into depression for all of my teenage life.  i wouldnt leave the house except to go school, didnt want anyone to see see my horrific face, at school i would avoid socialising completely while the other kids made fun of my face on a daily basis, calling me pizza face. people would look at me in disgust, like i was unclean and thats why i had these large spots. the acne ravaged my uni and sixth form years.  i tried all sorts of products and medications to no avail, couldnt wear makeup since im a dude, not that it would help much since the spots were huge.   only at the age of 21 did the cystic acne go away, it left me with deep scarring on the right side of my face that will never go away, but i cant give two shits  about how my face looks now, or what people think. 
Fat_mongoose	Bicep width | I've been working out for over a year now, and my biceps look huge when you look at them from the side, but from the front they look average. Is there a good way to increase width? My routine:  Monday  = biceps, lats  Tuesday = shoulders, traps Wednesday = legs, lower back Thursday = chest, triceps  For biceps I do, supinated dumbell curl, hammer curls, chin ups and lat pulldowns. Thanks 
Fat_mongoose	Would a small plane flying inside of a larger plane add to it's weight? | [removed]
Fat_mongoose	A lot of visible buttcracks, it's traumatizing.
Fat_mongoose	To each their own, it's not something that I would try because the list of side effects isn't worth it for me. It's good you haven't had any negative effects but there maybe long term symptoms that could occur after steroid use. 
Fat_mongoose	Oh man, you had it very tough but know none of it was your fault, stay strong as the biggest screw you to everyone who caused you this misery. 
Fat_mongoose	Would that be traps? I do dumbell shrugs for those. I also do bent over shoulder raises.
Fat_mongoose	Thanks everyone, i will add reverse curls and I'll look into upper back workouts  For triceps I do close grip bench press And skullcrushers, along with bench press (flat, decline and inclibe) and dumbell pullover for the chest + triceps as a secondary.
Fat_mongoose	No, as long as you say no homo before entering.
Fat_mongoose	Well you need to look at things without faith, (this thing is true because the quran said it is). Once you can overcome that then leaving is easier.   Mohammed marrying a 6 year old, child marriage and sexual slavery in quran. All the violence and hate, and the threat of eternal torture made me realise how wrong this all Is, and when I tried to get answers they weren't adequate, oh it's just a metaphor. Oh we interpreted it wrong, context bro.  
Fat_mongoose	23, exmuslim from the UK here to talk. Closeted at the moment, plan to leave as soon as I finish uni because I can't stand Islam. 
Fat_mongoose	Why in the case of FE do they add the matrices instead of it being a matrix of 2 row 1 column matrix of (6,28), but when we move to (DE)F we dont use the same rule. DE equals 2x1 vector (22,26) which multiplied by F (1X2 vector (3,7))  gives a 2x2 vector instead of a 2x1 vector like in the case of FE. The answer i got for (DE)F was 2x1 vector (66,78)
Fat_mongoose	Why do the rules change here? Matrix calculations | 
Fat_mongoose	Prove x<y if and only if x^2 < y^2. x and y are both positive numbers. | 
Fat_mongoose	My friend used the argument that 11 year olds are mature enough to marry and that the recent 18 year old decision was just a recent western society thing. "But an 11 year old can't give informed consent, their bodies aren't ready for child birth" in which he responds with "they are, you just believe they aren't because society told you it's bad" there's no reasoning with him 
Fat_mongoose	Shinjiraranai!!!! Nani bullshit kore wa

Fat_mongoose	I'll look into zelda between worlds, never played picross but I do like story based visual novel/puzzle games such as hotel dusk. I got a wiiu the only games I enjoyed on it were smash bros, Mario kart and bayonetta 
Fat_mongoose	999 and virtues last reward were so Good, the 3rd was disappointing. Haven't played the latest Layton game. I also loved both danganronpas. I have not played botw yet since the switch isn't a worthy investment at the moment and I'll admit I have not played any zelda game before (yes I know I'm a heathen) what's your favourite all time game?
Fat_mongoose	After being on a computer all day at work I don't want to sit at a desk at home so I stay away from pc gaming in general, I have a 3ds but it's collecting dust at the moment, played games like Phoenix Wright, professor Layton, fire emblem. Waiting for danganronpa 3 so I can dust off the vita. Never played etrian odyssey and I've only played metroid prime hunters on ds. I'll get switch when there are more games available, only zelda interests me so far 
Fat_mongoose	Ok i got it, I made the series into x, xsqrd, xcubed so s became s (1-x) and then used the infinite geometric formula to come up with x(1-x)squared. The 2nd question has me lost though, thanks for the help 
Fat_mongoose	Still unsure on how to work it out.
Fat_mongoose	Not sure how to solve these, if you can provide the method and answer i will greatly appreciate it, thanks.

Fat_mongoose	Nani the fuck did omae just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of watashino class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the ichiban letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nanimonai to watashi but just another weeaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has itsumonai been mimasu’d before on kono continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As bokutachi hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so anata better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu’s the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano jinsei. You’re fucking shinimashita’d, akachan.
Fat_mongoose	Yes, very touching 
Fat_mongoose	Incoming weaboos
Fat_mongoose	I'm glad you stuck by your beliefs and didn't bend over backwards for your parents. I hope you have a great wedding and a great non Muslim life.
Fat_mongoose	No reasoning with these type of people
Fat_mongoose	I don't hate myself enough 
Fat_mongoose	I hate everyone equally Just kidding, I can only hate those who cause suffering for others
Fat_mongoose	Need friends for that 
Fat_mongoose	She's a 5 a day prayer hijabi but she took the news ok, she said she won't mention it to our parents but I can't give any of my reasons for leaving because she thinks it will corrupt her.

Fat_mongoose	So infuriating, these guidance assholes and whoever they serve. =_=
Fat_mongoose	This is so sad, atleast he is getting punished for it
Fat_mongoose	You can get that asshole arrested for assault. If you can support yourself i would suggest moving out. Take care be safe
Fat_mongoose	Very strong coffee while at work. I'll probably get around 5 hours of sleep a night so I'll try take a nap when I get home from work. (It takes me ages to fall asleep so naps might not be possible). Catch up on sleep during weekends
Fat_mongoose	"If you want to live in peace, then implement sharia" wtf?
Fat_mongoose	I'm so glad this sub exists. Love yo all
Fat_mongoose	Yep that's Islam for you, nothing here matters, luckily you'll be moving and won't have to deal with this nonsense anymore. 
Fat_mongoose	Propaganda and fear from childhood, being told every day you must love god and boom Stockholm syndrome 
Fat_mongoose	Eat crap tonnes at work. Starve to death on the weekends. It's fulllproof
Fat_mongoose	R/peoplefuckingdying
Fat_mongoose	Yeah this is quite worrying, I second that other dudes opinion, don't go to the Middle East.
Fat_mongoose	Make up any excuse and stay safe. Do your parents know about the marrying cousin and divorcing plan? Because that's as despicable as it gets. you can also try getting a GP note saying you cant go for health reasons, if you explain to the GP your situation.
Fat_mongoose	Depends on the country. Here in the UK the parents won't find out as long as she goes by herself and states her parents can't have access to medical records. 
Fat_mongoose	Waking up for work will be annoying after coming home at 12.30 from  teraweeh, and then waking up at 2.30 to eat. I usually sleep 11 - 6.30 on a work day and that still isn't enough sleep and I question whether I really need a job :( 
Fat_mongoose	Hopefully that douche is out of the picture. I don't understand these parents arranging marriages from as early as 6. 
Fat_mongoose	:( I hope mum never finds out. 
Fat_mongoose	Kamehame, no
Fat_mongoose	i usually stay away from bad movies, but i was dragged by a friend to go watch the latest resident evil movie. The action scenes had so much quick edits and cuts and camera changes that you couldnt tell what was going on. It just made me angry, so much so i went home and watched Children of men to put my mind at ease.
Fat_mongoose	Take my upvote

Fat_mongoose	If one of my noble arms card is destroyed during my opponents turn, can i still activate its turn and reequip it to one of my noble knight monsters, or can that effect only be activated on my turn. Thanks
Fat_mongoose	With noble arms cards, are they still activated if they are destroyed on my opponents turn while I have a noble knight monster  ('re equip when destroyed) 
Fat_mongoose	thanks!
Fat_mongoose	With stardust Sifrs 2nd ability (When a monster effect is activated, negate it and destroy 1 card on the field), it states here that it cannot be activated in the damage step http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Stardust_Sifr_Divine_Dragon  Can Eben illusion magicians 2nd ability be used against this? the ability is when a spellcaster declares an attack, it can target 1 monster on the field and banish it.  Or can stardust sifr negate this ability? Thanks
Fat_mongoose	Need some clarification with Sifr divine dragon | [removed]
Fat_mongoose	Yep, how annoying, ive sent a message on all those links. nonsensical design choice 
Fat_mongoose	Mind blown

OfficialTransWoman	I feel ready to die | I don't feel like I have anything to live for. Mental and physical illness has left me unable to succeed academically, I lack the confidence or strength to come out and transition, my closest friends abandoned me because I wasn't fun any more on account of being so depressed, and now I'm just stuck with no-one caring about me and no hope of accomplishing anything or finding love. I'm just a burden on my parents, stuck supporting their loser offspring who should be independent by now. I just don't see anything left to stay alive for. I just want people to tell me it's OK for me to go, to tell me that I'm not a piece of shit for wanting to take the easy way out.
OfficialTransWoman	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-with-autism-can-read-emotions-feel-empathy1/ If difficulty with empathy is something that you experience personally, then I'm not going to suggest you're wrong about your own experiences. Please do not generalise all of us as experiencing things in the same way as you.
OfficialTransWoman	Maybe she felt good about it when they said it, but didn't realise why yet on account of still being an egg.

OfficialTransWoman	Neutral :(
OfficialTransWoman	I mean yeah it's definitely The Culture. 
OfficialTransWoman	It me
OfficialTransWoman	Does the show have any redeeming features? | It somehow manages to be too slowly paced to be interesting while also rushing key plot points (The people in the mall decide to kill people who break the rules on what, the second day since the mist arrived?)   None of the characters are at all interesting or likeable or smart, although Adrian might have been if not for him being made into yet another cliched evil queer for the sake of a predictable plot twist. Which I think might have been offensive, if it wasn't so dull.   Is there anything in this show that you would consider a positive? Anything you enjoyed?
OfficialTransWoman	I cry occasionally over very big stuff, life changing tragedy kind of stuff, but honestly I want to be able to cry over something smaller. To be able to express emotion without my entire life having to collapse.
OfficialTransWoman	Hey now, it wasn't just spooky ghosts! There was also a moth! :/
OfficialTransWoman	Does the showrunner count?
OfficialTransWoman	This is adorable
OfficialTransWoman	Honestly if someone said that to me I'd probably never speak to them again.

OfficialTransWoman	That's totally fine, I can understand not wanting to be public about these feelings right away. May I suggest making another account and using that for trans talk and such, because it really is important you deal with these feelings.
OfficialTransWoman	So you've recently started to think you might be transgender then, I take it? May we ask for some more detail on exactly what kind of thinks you've been having about it?

I want someone to help me and because I'm often fairly calm in person people don't help me because they don't understand just how bad it's getting. I'm still in the closet and I'm just so conditioned towards hiding everything that I don't know how to tell people the truth. How do I get people to pay attention?

How do I put it into their heads just how bad things are going?
OfficialTransWoman	What's the plot about, is it mostly combat or social?  How many characters are in your party, and what classes are they in? What are the rest of your character levels in?  What do you think would fit in well with your character's personality?   If you're hunting Necromancers, take Carrion Compass, if your party has no-one who's good at healing and you want some support abilities, consider cure light wounds.

OfficialTransWoman	:O You're so beautiful.
OfficialTransWoman	Episodes like Time Enough at Last and The Shelter are still fantastic to this day. A lot of it has aged very poorly though, and many episodes simply don't hold up in the modern day, especially since a lot of the twists are predictable by today's standards. (For example, "The Rip Van Winkle Caper" features a group of criminals who steal gold then freeze themselves to escape the statute of limitations, so they can sell their gold in the future. Do I even need to say what they twist is?)

OfficialTransWoman	Looking really critically, I can see a tiny bit of facial hair shadow on your other lip that could be a giveaway, but I had to look pretty hard and I think unless someone was actively looking you definitely pass. Your bone structure definitely looks quite feminine in this picture which is good. 
OfficialTransWoman	Cheap online clothing stores. | Hey peeps.   So I'm looking to buy a load of women's clothing, partially for purposes of figuring out what kind of stuff suits me plus nailing down sizes, but I'm not confident enough to go into a shop yet. What are some very low priced sites that I could order from? Thanks in advance everyone <3   Edit: Thanks for your responses everyone, will definitely check out your recommended sites. 
OfficialTransWoman	?
OfficialTransWoman	Honestly trans people dedicate a huge amount of thought and action to being the gender that we are, figuring out what gender we are and what that means to us, and working hard to become that. A far more real and solid embodiment of our gender than some cisgendered person who just stumbled onto it and decided it was OK. Like heck yeah trans men are the only real men, and trans women are the only real women.  :p

Just generally looking or advice on that first doctors appointment and how to deal with the system.   Thanks in advance, everyone :)

OfficialTransWoman	Or when it turned out Princess Carolyn is actually a tabby who dyes her fur.
OfficialTransWoman	Never seen anyone actually have a source on that shit so I'm gonna say your parents are talking out their bungholes, but I suppose it's possible there's been cases of it happening that're buried in google searches underneath the seemingly infinite pile of reports involving cis men molesting kids.

OfficialTransWoman	Is it true that they can just make it from your colon anyway??
OfficialTransWoman	Maybe the worst episode of any Star Trek. 
OfficialTransWoman	Amusing
OfficialTransWoman	Could you maybe go to some sort of self defence class or something to get more confident that you'll be able to defend yourself? Or perhaps go out with your biggest, toughest friend so they'll make you feel safer?
OfficialTransWoman	Choosing a name | Hello ladies, gents, and assorted others!   Is it unusual that I feel quite uncomfortable with the idea of coming out and changing my name to something, if I already know people with that name? Recently met someone named Hannah, which is what I intended to change it to upon coming out, and now I'm not so sure.
OfficialTransWoman	I'd very much like to Lily. 
OfficialTransWoman	Comedy gold
OfficialTransWoman	I swear to flip I saw a gif of her in a miniskirt wiggle her hips so her dingle fell out once.
OfficialTransWoman	I'm all of these except using the word traps haha. Not sure what the one at the top in the beanie is. Definitely ME_IRL.  Please maybe put trigger warnings for pictures of self injury in future though please and also for suicide mentions.
OfficialTransWoman	Don't get me wrong, it's also representative of deeply distressing feelings of dysphoria, but it is a good joke too.
OfficialTransWoman	Very amusing
OfficialTransWoman	Huh. I see what you mean. Interesting.
OfficialTransWoman	Also a possibility.
OfficialTransWoman	That's how I interpreted it. 
OfficialTransWoman	"I want to be treated like a girl" Sounds like your answer to me.
OfficialTransWoman	Thank you
ynapd	F*k | 
ynapd	Yes, better get a good sunscreen since makeup doesn't really give you adequate sun protection, especially that you're using glycolic acid in the morning.
ynapd	This made me cry. Yes, after all these years, it just doesn't get better. 
ynapd	Holy crap, just learned about that type of communication in class. 
ynapd	22 y/o here, feelig the same. Most of my batchmates are doing better, can hold jobs, getting married/in great relationships, travelling, or even just improved physically. Meanwhile I'm still struggling with acne, have gained weight significantly, and working 2 jobs (where I can barely show up nowadays cause of motivation/energy issues) while forcing myslef to finish a master's program in a major that my parents basically forced me to take. Basically pretty much heading towards failure lol. But I'm thinking maybe quitting on social media may help. Apparently, people's lives aren't as perfect as they appear to be. But I dunno, still seems better than the crap we depressed people deal with. 
ynapd	I have the same problem. Doesn't help that it actually comes from my own mother. Whenever I feel like I'm about to climb out of my struggles, or even just get a glimpse of hope that everything might get better in the future, she just comes in and berates me. Last Saturday was my dad's bday party, and apparently it bothered her that I've gained so much weight and look fat in the pictures. So from then on she decided that she's gonna call me all kinds of fat insults,so that I'd start losing weight. I guess if one doesn't have depression this is not as big of a deal, but if you're already depressed and just keeping it to yourself it just builds on top of other things that are occupying your mind. I dunno, apparently people just do what they do, and for the most part doesn't notice or care about other people's struggles. You can risk telling the person what you're going through, but if that person is the type who doesn't take depression seriously (you're doing fine, why are you even depressed? People nowadays are so weak and can't cope with problems), then you risk to get triggered by that person again. I can suggest though that if you do decide on talking to the person, instead of focusing on how that person made you feel that time, focus the convo on the actual situation that went down. Communicate the fact that what he/she did was not fair (and this is why, etc.) This way, no matter what her reaction is,it might make you feel less bad since you asserted yourself, and at that point, how the person responds is the reflection of her/himself. If I'm not being intrusive though, what did this person do?
ynapd	Definitely. Sounds cliche, but sometimes I just wanna move to a place where nobody knows me, change my name and start over. But I also feel like if I still have the same ugly appearance and brain fogged mind I'm still prolly gonna end up in the same situation.
ynapd	I would like to know as well. We have counselling in my university but I just can't get myself to come. I wanna know what a 'typical' session is like, if tgere is such.
ynapd	Thanks fr the input. I understand you, especially with the motivation issues, because the lack of energy to do things is real (some people think it's just all in our heads, but no, depressed people truly don't have the energy ).I ended up not verbalizing my anger, as that person (my mom) and I stopped speaking after our fight. Sad part is, II'm actually relieved that I don't have to deal with herfor now, because she has always been physically and verbally hostile towards me. 
ynapd	When I was 13/14 I wrote an essay about suicidal thoughts for my innocent values education assignment. Didn't think of it as a big deal, i seriously thought that my classmates wrote about the same thing. However my teacher apparently got very worried, wrote me a letter, talked to me in private, and had a speech about sadness and coping in class. Never accepted nor acknowledged the fact that I was depressed, till recently where i can barely get out of bed, have to force myself to shower, and having crazy mood swings and memory/cognition problems. I dunno if I would've been fine if i stayed in my country, but migrating I guess took a toll on my mental health.   Edited cause I hit post accidentally.
ynapd	I have the same symptoms as you (down to the random chest issues), and have yet to see a doc regarding what's wrong. I did answer this questionnaire http://www.ulifeline.org/self_evaluator and got major depression as my #1 possible diagnosis. If you don't have a school or are not from the US, you can pick any college. If you're in the US though I'd suggest to pick a school near you and they might have resources that could help. But just as others have already mentioned, you still need to see a doctor.
ynapd	I agree with you. I'm just waiting for my life to be over. 
ynapd	Depression Turning into Rage/Anger | I might've reached a whole new level of misery. Nowadays, I'm either sleeping almost the entire day, or losing my temper over the slightest things. I'm resorting to violence more often (I usually am fine handling these things, crying for release used to work but now I don't even get a chance to gather my thoughts, uncontrollable rage just takes over me and I just want to beat the person causing me pain repeatedly. Even when I don't act on it, the thought of just stomping, punching someone repeatedly persists for days). Once I am able to rid myself of those thoughts it's followed by thoughts of killing myself. Is letting the person who is causing me pain know how much I hate her help take the edge off? I apologize in advance on how this post comes off, but I don't know what to do anymore. This is the best way that I could describe how I'm feeling right now. 
ynapd	I feel the same way. Had suicidal thoughts since I was 13. I'm 22 now.  All these years, nobody knows that I've been going through something because I do well academically.  What sucks the most is that I didn't even want to make it this far in life, but I have to keep pretending that I am perfectly fine. I don't even know how others make it when they suffer for even longer than I have. The pain just doesn't go away. 
safetyindarkness	I don't know who or what I am, I'm drowning in work and classes, and I just can't take it anymore. [Long] | I hate every last part of who I am, from my gender to my hair color and everything else. I hate the bloody, disgusting hole between my legs and wish I could fill it with cement. PIV is not pleasurable for me and stresses me out. Menstruation, pregnancy, and birth all sound horrible. Maybe I'd want a kid of my own one day, but I have no desire to carry that baby, and my male SO can't do it...  I hate the balls of fat on my chest and wish I could cut them off and just have a flat chest like a guy.   I have red hair that everyone is constantly commenting on. I don't like the attention. I've cut it very, very short (like a 5 with clippers) and wear a hat partially to hide it and keep it from drawing attention.   I hate the apartment my SO and I are living in. He's asked me to vocalize what I hate about it specifically, but I'm honestly not even sure exactly what it is. But I honestly do. For the first few weeks, I couldn't stand being there at all, and hid under the bed to not have to see it while I cried about it. Eventually, I just kind of accepted it. I still hate it, but I don't constantly cry about that in particular.  I'm currently attending a school I hate, doing a double major in 2 subjects I don't necessarily love. One's difficult and I took it on because my SO and a friend thought I'd be good at it. The other's a bullshit major; something to fall back on in case I fail out of the hard one. I used to be a perfect student, but last semester I failed a class for the first time and had to repeat it over the summer.  I don't want to sound like I'm blaming anyone or like I'm playing the victim, but I'm going to end up sounding that way. A lot of my problems stem from an abusive mother (physically, verbally, emotionally) and my abusive ex (rapist). I haven't spoken to my mother in over a year, and sometimes I wish I had a real mother.   I was with my ex for 2 years and raped hundreds of times during that span. He pinned me down and had me call him "master".   I've been self-harmer since. But recently, I've gotten a lot more reckless with it. I used to cut on just one thigh, then moved to just one hip when I couldn't hide my thigh very well in the summer. Now, I'm cutting from my thighs to the top of my breasts, and everything in between, as well as my wrists.  I've given up completely on making friends. I lost all my friends in high school thanks to the mess I became with my ex. I don't talk to people in class, and I don't go any more in depth than necessary with customers and random people who try to engage me.   All my emotions seem muted. Anxiety has taken a backseat, and now I just try to force myself to go to class and do the bare minimum to keep up appearances that I'm a normal, functioning human being. I don't really feel anything at all, let alone love, for my family, and even my feelings for my SO seem muted or hard to access (I'm not totally sure how to explain it...).  But I'm still a mess. And there's nothing i can do about it. I want to die. I can't handle 18 credits, 2 jobs, and relationships. I can't quit my first job because it's part of my financial aid (work study). I don't want to quit my second job because it's the only thing I enjoy even a little out of the main three (2 jobs and school). I can't drop out of school because I'd lose financial aid and screw up any future I still have a chance at. I don't even see a future right now. I cannot imagine myself alive next week, let alone in 5 years.   I don't have the time or energy or desire for therapy. I don't need to waste hours of my week spilling my guts (something else I cannot do) and hearing someone tell me, "Think positive! It gets better! Mindfulness!". I can't tell anyone or talk to anyone other than my SO.   The only other choice I can see for myself going forward is suicide. I attempted once before when I was with my ex and failed miserably because I didn't do any research. So. Yeah. Just a long rambling vent, I guess. I'm not even sure what I'm hoping to get out of it. 
safetyindarkness	I know how you feel. If you wanna talk at all, PM me? 
safetyindarkness	Beautiful tribute. I'm so sorry for your losses. And thank you for your service. You're a wonderful person and I hope you do well in life. 
safetyindarkness	Shortened and drunk rant. Since it keeps disappearing before I get to post it. | I want to die, but I'm really bad at it. I dream all the time of getting super drunk and cutting deep enough to die or jumping from either a tall building or onto a major highway.  I don't want to be a female. I want to fill this disgusting hole between my legs with cement and I want to cut off my breasts, even though my SO likes them and wants kids someday. He always talks about how much he likes my female parts, but I hate them all. Ideally, I'd be a Ken doll with a clit. I don't want a penis or testicles. They're too obvious. Sorry this isn't very well written; I'm pretty drunk right now. I've tried paying this at least four times already but it keeps disappearing before I get a chance to do so.   My mother and my ex were abusive. I've lost just about all of my friends. I don't feel love for my family like I used to. My feelings for my SO are muted. I hate the apartment I'm living in and the school I attend and the majors I'm in. I want to die but I'm not very good at it. I don't want to keep going. I want out.
safetyindarkness	Thanks and sorry you're in the same boat
safetyindarkness	Cop Tells 15yo her Mom has the RIGHT to Spank and Push Her; and She's Being Disrespectful by Defending Herself | 
safetyindarkness	Did anyone else notice the discrepancy in the dates of the email? First it said the "August 2, 2016" email, then a bit later, "April 2, 2016". Not that it matters, just something that caught my eye.
safetyindarkness	one more moment
safetyindarkness	Join the club, buddy.
safetyindarkness	I really like this shot, especially the DOF and muted tones. However, the man in the background is an extreme distraction on that front. This looks like a professional, business/advertising shot, and the focus and colors and background all help make it look so well-done, but, to me, the man distracts from that feel. It may have been alright and it may have worked had you had multiple people in the shot, like customers ordering at the bar, but because there's only half of one man, it doesn't work with the rest of the shot. Love everything else about it! Very well done! Just thought I'd offer a little critique.
safetyindarkness	>It also looks very clean.  I wonder what method they used, since... you know, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
safetyindarkness	To me, the coloring is a bit odd. She seems to have too much red in her face. She's very pale, but her face is almost the same shade as her lips. Also, the focus seems to be on her chest/between her collarbones, rather than her face due to the color and lighting.  And, take this advice from a redhead: the color red doesn't go well with redheads. This applies with clothing and with your background. If it were a different color, especially a light or pastel color, her hair would pop so much more, and add another color/dimension to this photo.   There's one small area of blue under her left arm that is confusing/distracting.   Overall, I love the pose, expression, and DOF. You're doing a great job, and you may be able to fix all the coloring in post! This is a great shot of a beautiful model! Well done.
safetyindarkness	Literally all of it. I hate it here. People only ever talk about how great it is, and are completely unreceptive when I say I hate it, which just makes it worse. 
safetyindarkness	My youngest brother got run over by his own horse when he was about 4 or 5. Broke his jaw in 2 or 3 places and had to get stitches on his chin, I think. Jaw was wired shut for a couple weeks. Horses can be dangerous if you're not careful and know what you're doing around them.
safetyindarkness	"The place that belongs to you is the place you belong."  I disagree. I don't think this is necessarily true. Technically, the apartment I'm paying rent on "belongs to me", but this is not a place I feel like I belong. I hate it here. I've been more depressed since moving in here than I have since I was still living in my abusive mom's house and dating my abusive ex. I don't belong in this place that belongs to me. I hate everything about it, from the carpet to the couch to the microwave. I hate living in the city, I hate being near the frat houses, and on and on. I don't belong here, and if I do, then I may as well fucking die, because I cannot stand to keep living here. I attempted once before, when I was still with abusive people, and never really seriously considered it again until I moved in here. So I really can't agree with that statement.
safetyindarkness	I want to go home but don't have a place I can call home. | I think this is homesickness, though before these past couple years, I've never been homesick. All I can think about is wanting to go "home". But I don't know where "home" is. Does anyone else feel this way?   Part of it, I think, is just feeling like I don't belong here; here being anywhere or with anyone in my life. I don't belong in college, I don't belong with my peers, I don't belong in either of my jobs, or with my friends, or myfamily, or my SO. I don't belong in the apartment I'm in now, and it will never be home to me.   But neither of my parents' houses feel like home either. The house I grew up in for almost 18 years was hell, not home. My dad's house is just that: my dad's house. Not my home. I don't know what to do. It's been barely 2 weeks in this apartment and I just can't take it. 
safetyindarkness	What you described: "in my worst hours I cry to myself like a little girl and whisper to myself "I just want to go home" over and over" is EXACTLY what I was talking about. I've done this so many times and it just feels shitty when you stop long enough to think, "but where is home?" And coming to the realization that it just doesn't exist. There is no home for me. I'm sorry you feel the same way, but it's somewhat comforting to know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Hopefully, if we ever get better, we can figure this mess out.
safetyindarkness	Thanks for the kind words. I looked up Hiraeth and some of the definitions do fit pretty well, especially "a longing for a home you can't return to, or one that was never yours". That's really close to the feeling I was trying to describe. Thank you.
safetyindarkness	I'm not sure it's exactly the same for me, but I can definitely relate. My parents divorced when I was young and neither house feels like home. And when I say "home", I'm not really referring to a house I used to have or my "hometwon", because none of tose places carried that feeling of "being home", in a place I belong. I'm still not sure if I'm making sense. Sorry. And I can definitely see why your dad's house wouldn't feel like home.
safetyindarkness	I'm glad you have that vision in mind. It really seems like a good thing to work towards. For me, it's​not about finding a place that belongs to me, but more of a place where I belong. You'll get to that home with a truck in the driveway and a dog at your side one day.
safetyindarkness	She is insane hahaha. And thank you.
safetyindarkness	The Time My Nmom Yelled At Me For Helping A Woman In A Car Crash | I was reading (and posted in) that AskReddit thread about accidentally causing someone else's death (though my story is only tangentially related), and was reminded of the "aftermath" of the accident.  Long story short, almost exactly four years ago, when I was 15, there was an accident on the highway in front of my house, and I ran with two others to help the female driver laying in the street. No one helped the other driver, a male, and he died.   Anyway, when my nmom got home (during the end stages of the accident cleanup), and my brothers and I told her about what had happened and my role in trying to help, she turned to me, and started screaming at me. How could I be so stupid to get involved in something like that? What if I did something wrong and the woman I tried to help got hurt worse because of me? What if they sued us? Because there's no way I could have actually done the right thing. Had I not helped, I would have been a  terrible, heartless person (this based on a rant she gave us years earlier when we happened upon a motorcycle accident where other bystanders did nothing and the man died). There's no way to win. I'm glad I made the decision I did, even if it ended in me getting yelled at, and I would make the same decision again.   Edit: full story at   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6gmrji/comment/dis7lpf  Hope I linked that right.
safetyindarkness	I don't know if I was necessarily the cause of his death, but I certainly could have done more to save his life.  My childhood home is hidden above a blind curve on a highway with two lanes going each direction. The speed limit is 40 mph, but people regularly go 60+. It was after school (I was a sophomore in high school) and my 3 brothers and I were watching tv in the living room when I heard a weird noise outside by the road. Car crashes don't sound the way you think they should.   I looked out the window and saw no cars moving, which seemed odd since it was afternoon rush hour on a weekday in June. I ran to the kitchen and pulled on the first shoes I could find; a pair of winter boots I used to feed the horses when it was muddy. I ran down the driveway and saw two vehicles facing the guardrail opposite my house in a "V" shape.   Traffic had stopped in both directions and a man to my left who had gotten out of his car yelled that he had called 911. To the right of the vehicles was a woman laying in the road.   I was certain she had been thrown out of her car's windshield (seemed especially likely since I had just finished driver's ed in school and all we ever seemed to do was watch videos about that happening). I ran over to her without looking at either vehicle. I started talking to her, asking if she was injured, if she knew her name. She still had on a lanyard with her ID card, with her name (I'll call her Tina) which showed that she was a nurse at a hospital and told me that her leg and her back hurt.   Around that time, two other women who had been in cars behind hers came over to me and Tina. I asked if she had been thrown from the car, and she started rambling that she smelled smoke and she had to get out of the car. She kept repeating that it had smelled like smoke and she had to get out. She started struggling to get up and the me and the other two women told her to stay lying down and keep still.   My three brothers had made it to the road by this point, and the oldest one (around 13 at the time) was holding the younger two (7 and 6) back at the side of the road. He asked if he could help and I told him to just keep the younger ones back and out of the road.   Tina was begging for one of us to call her husband because she couldn't find her phone (it was still in her car). One of the other women said she would call and asked Tina for her husband's phone number. It took Tina a few moments to understand the request before reciting it. She was still struggling to get up, while we tried to keep her calm and still, since she had already told us she was injured. One of the women asked if there had been anyone else in the car, which she thankfully said no.   After a few more minutes of us talking to Tina about random things to keep her calm (did she have children, what was her job) the cops and EMTs finally showed up. We gave the EMTs as much info about Tina as we could, since she had taken to mostly rambling. They had taken over and the other women went back to their cars. The cops started redirecting traffic.   I finally stood up and went over to my brothers, and ushered them back towards the house.   This was the first time I actually took a good look at the scene. There was a black truck and Tina's white SUV, both front bumpers touching the guardrail. One of the wheels from the truck had come off completely and was about 20 feet away, so the truck was sitting unevenly. Both vehicles' front bumpers were hanging off and the guardrail was dented between them. EMTs were at the driver's side of the truck, and all I could make out between them was the white airbags against the dark interior of the truck.   I stood at the bottom of my driveway as the cops started to piece together what had happened. My 13 yr old brother had come back down and joined me, having left the younger two in the house watching tv. He pointed out ripped up grass beside our driveway and tire tracks cutting across the dirt driveway. From this and from listening to the cops, we were able to piece together that the man driving the truck had been speeding in the right hand lane on our side of the road, jumped half his truck onto the curb and rode there for 30+ feet, then veered left, cut across the left hand lane on our side and hit Tina's SUV in the left lane going the opposite direction.   A few minutes later, the cops told us we couldn't be there. We went inside, but I continued watching from higher up the driveway and later one of our front windows. An ambulance came along, and they loaded up the male truck driver... almost an hour after the accident had occurred. The ambulance drove away slowly with no lights or sirens.   It was later confirmed to me that he had died. I was never told exactly from what (could have been a heart attack which made him lose control and cause the accident or he could have died on impact or even while I was with Tina). I talked later with my 13 year old brother about it.   He told me that no one had gone over to help the truck driver. He had been left to die alone. There were three of us helping Tina and no one ever once thought to go check on the other driver. In the moment, I had been so concerned with the woman laying in the street that i ran to her first without even thinking to check on the other driver. I had the fleeting thought at one point that someone else was helping him, like maybe the man who had called 911, since he could have easily seen the driver from where he was out of his car and standing in the road.   But that man died alone and no one ever even checked on him, let alone tried to help him or even just been there with him in his last moments. I felt guilty for weeks and still do just a little, since I knew the man was there but never checked on him and never made sure anyone else was helping him.   Edit: Tl;dr - car crash outside my house, me and 2 others ran to help the female driver, no one helped the male driver and he died alone.

safetyindarkness	First Apartment. Everyone's Excited But Me. I Just Want To Cry Thinking About It. | Already posted a bit about this a few weeks ago. But, here I am again as the move-in date approaches...   My head hurts and my chest feels tight just thinking about it. My boyfriend who I'm moving in with, his parents, and my parents are all excited about this. I'm not. They keep asking if I'm excited and if I'm ready. I'm not. I probably won't ever be. I don't want to ruin this for everyone else, but I really hate even the idea of an apartment. It stresses me out and makes me want to cry or worse (self-harm, suicidal ideation) every time I think about it. I've spent what little summer break I had preparing everything. And now I have to return to a school I hate to take classes I'm not going to do well in for a major I know I can't succeed in and move into, pay rent for, and take care of an apartment I never wanted and don't want to be in. I know I probably sound like a spoiled brat, but I can't take it. I just want to go back to before depression and anxiety and all the rest. But even that wouldn't be much better. I don't know what to do and it's not going to get better for me in the next few years. I know I'm going to have a breakdown over this in the next week and I just hope it's not in front of anyone else, especially since only my boyfriend knows about my depression and how I really feel about this. What can I do? 
safetyindarkness	Thanks for your reply, and your concern. Hope you get better, too.
safetyindarkness	I have not seen anyone; I'm not on any medication, and I would not be capable of or comfortable with going and seeing anyone for any of these issues.
safetyindarkness	It's not just lack of happiness, though. It's a really intense feeling of despair, for lack of a better word. It's not that I just don't feel happy. I get extremely depressed about having reached a milestone. A lot of the time, I literally break down into tears and feel the need to throw up. I don't think it's just a matter of flipping a switch, but I don't know for sure.
safetyindarkness	Reaching Milestones Makes Me Feel Worse | I've been depressed for about 3 or 4 years now. I also have anxiety and PTSD. One thing I've realized about my depression is that I always get/feel much worse when I hit a big milestone that would make anyone else feel successful/happy. Is this normal? Does this happen for anyone else?  A few examples are my high school graduation, starting college, choosing a major, and the current one: getting my first apartment that I'm sharing with my boyfriend.   I really feel awful, too, because I know he's super excited, and both of our parents are excited, too. He feels like this is an adventure, but every time someone talks about the apartment I just want to cry and/or throw up. It stresses me out. Today, we bought a couch with our own money, and my parents bought us a mattress. I completely shut down. The day we paid the security deposit and signed the lease, we drove home, and I sat in the car crying for half an hour.  My boyfriend was happy and proud and excited, but I just felt worse and worse throughout the day. I don't understand why this is. I don't want to ruin everything for him. I feel like I'm weighing him down and ruining the experience for him. He is the only one who knows about my depression, but even my parents have questioned why I don't seem excited for this big event and my boyfriend's mom has noticed that I seem quieter since the start of the apartment search.  I'm not sure what to do, or why I always end up feeling this way with things that are supposed to be really great, positive milestones. I can't enjoy my own life, and I'm ruining big things for my boyfriend as well. Sorry this is so long and sorry for bad formatting. Any suggestions? Similar experiences?  TL;DR: Depression always gets worse for me leading up to and during big milestones. Everyone notices. Feel like I'm ruining things for boyfriend who's excited. Does this happen to anyone else? What can I do?

Does this happen for anyone else? A few examples are my high school graduation, starting college, choosing a major, and the current one: getting my first apartment that I'm sharing with my boyfriend. I really feel awful, too, because I know he's super excited, and both of our parents are excited, too. He feels like this is an adventure, but every time someone talks about the apartment I just want to cry and/or throw up. It stresses me out. Today, we bought a couch with our own money, and my parents bought us a mattress. I completely shut down. The day we paid the security deposit and signed the lease, we drove home, and I sat in the car crying for half an hour. My boyfriend was happy and proud and excited, but I just felt worse and worse throughout the day. I don't understand why this is. I don't want to ruin everything for him. I feel like I'm weighing him down and ruining the experience for him. He is the only one who knows about my depression, but even my parents have questioned why I don't seem excited for this big event and my boyfriend's mom has noticed that I seem quieter since the start of the apartment search. I'm not sure what to do, or why I always end up feeling this way with things that are supposed to be really great, positive milestones. I can't enjoy my own life, and I'm ruining big things for my boyfriend as well. Sorry this is so long and sorry for bad formatting. Any suggestions? Similar experiences? TL;DR: Depression always gets worse for me leading up to and during big milestones. Everyone notices. Feel like I'm ruining things for boyfriend who's excited. Does this happen to anyone else? What can I do?
safetyindarkness	I'm not sure I understand what you mean... I have, technically, been getting the expected "good things". Could you explain further?
safetyindarkness	Thanks for replying. I'm sorry you have to go through this and feel this way, too. I guess it's kind of good to know I'm not the only one who feels this way, but no one should have to feel like their accomplishments are a bad thing. I'm really not sure what it is that I feel with this. I just feel bad, definitely stressed and depressed and anxious, but I don't know how it could be changed or fixed. It really sucks.
safetyindarkness	Exactly. For me, the two personalities are basically opposites. Which means they don't work well together. How can one consolidate opposites into some composite that makes sense?
safetyindarkness	Too relatable. There are two totally different people that are supposed to be me. I don't know how to sew them into one. They're such different people. Before, I was outgoing and confident and almost nothing bothered me. Now, I'm a depressed, anxious, suicidal mess. I wish I could go back.
safetyindarkness	Neither one of you should be blamed. What the friend did to you is not your fault or your SO's. The only person at fault is the friend. He is the one who made the decision to hurt you.
safetyindarkness	I think you're talking about learned helplessness.
safetyindarkness	I just tried to find it, but can't... Not sure what else I can do.
safetyindarkness	PM me if you want.
safetyindarkness	You should check out r/raisedbynarcissists. You'll find a lot of helpful, supportive people there. It's a great community.
safetyindarkness	I still, at 19, get extremely frustrated (to the point of tears and shutting down) if I don't understand something immediately. I chalk it up to being held to and achieving high standards as a kid. Then, once I got to the point where people start actually learning different things and having different strengths/weaknesses, I couldn't handle not being able to do everything on my own. Didn't help that my mom would say stuff like, "I thought you were supposed to be smart."
safetyindarkness	Talk to her. And more importantly; listen. Do not discredit anything that might be upsetting her. Friend stole her toy? Teacher told her she was being disruptive? She gave a wrong answer in class? Validate, validate, validate. Do not tell her the thing she's worried about isn't a big deal. Listen, understand her perspective, validate, strategize with her. And get her help as soon as possible. Have her talk to the school guidance counselor. Do not wait until it becomes a more serious issue.

safetyindarkness	I liked the book, i might have to look into the show now, but thanks for the heads up
safetyindarkness	My mom was kinda the same way. She ended every phone call, etc. with, "Love you, see you, bye!" which we expected to repeat back to her. I took to making a game of it. The game was to slur the words as badly as possible while still making it sound like I was parroting it back to her. So what started as, "Love you, see you, bye!" would turn into a super-fast, unintelligible "Uhyazeeyabuh!". 
safetyindarkness	Anxiety. Seriously. Depression makes me not want to do anything and just lay down and die. But anxiety forces me to prepare for the worst/prepare for the future. So in between picturing how I'd like to kill myself, I worked two 10-hour waitressing shifts and wrote a 10 page paper.
safetyindarkness	Thanks for your input. I'm just trying to see what people say to see if it's worth just trying once.
safetyindarkness	I know how you feel. I've been there. I'm still there. But we have to keep going for now. I'm not going to make up any bullshit about why, I'm just going to say we should keep going. We'll get through this.
safetyindarkness	I'm not on meds of any kind and I'm not looking to use it as a means to control anxiety. I'm just seeing whether it's worth it to try one time. No one is pressuring me, it's simply an option open to me, should I choose to take it.
safetyindarkness	I'm not looking to use it as a means to control anxiety. I'm just seeing whether it's worth it to try one time. I have no intentions of continuing on a regular basis. 
safetyindarkness	Thank you for being impartial, and for telling your experience. That's all I was looking for. I'm not looking to use it as a means to control anxiety. I'm just seeing whether it's worth it to try one time.
safetyindarkness	I'm not on meds of any kind. And I'm not looking to use it as a means to control anxiety. I'm just seeing whether it's worth it to try one time.

safetyindarkness	Cutting words isn't so strange. It seems common enough to me. I've done it a few times. It made me feel better that it wasn't just stirring round and round in my mind. It made them seem more real.
safetyindarkness	Anxiety and Alcohol | I (19F) have anxiety, along with depression and PTSD. I've never drank before, but my boyfriend said that drinking might calm me down for a little while. I've read conflicting things online about alcohol use being good for reducing anxiety (mostly temporarily) and being bad for reducing anxiety (more long-term, I think). Can anyone tell me what their experience is with anxiety and drinking? How does it affect you?   I already have a safe environment and a guarantee that it would be just my boyfriend and I if I decide to go through with it. He also made it very clear that it would be my decision whether I wanted to try and said he would not pressure me one way or the other.   So, what are your opinions and feelings on this combination? 
safetyindarkness	I love hiding away in a place - as long as I can be totally alone and not trapped by another person. I love small spaces, but I get really claustrophobic in small spaces with other people. And having a hideaway spot is the best. I used to sit in my closet with the sliding doors closed on top of a bunch of clothes when I was feeling panicky. Now that I'm in a dorm, it's hard to find a good spot, but I've found a couple.

safetyindarkness	I actually read this a couple days ago, but I had to take the time to think about and write this response...  You're not the only one. I was in a long-term (2 years) relationship with my rapist. I didn't see it for what it was at the time, and I didn't connect it to my issues (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.). I started self-harming (cutting) less than a year into the relationship. I've been out of that relationship for about a year and a half and in a new, healthy relationship with an amazing guy for just over a year now. I still cut. Why? Stress from school, stress from work, normal interactions (and lack thereof) that I feel I messed up at because of anxiety, self-hate, never being good enough, sex... The list goes on and on.  I should be better by now. I'm at an amazing place in life compared to 2 years ago... But I'm not. I still have this depression that's kicking in badly right now. I'm still anxious. I still self-harm.   Not all of us can move past it as easily as some. You said that because others have moved past their rapes, that you should be able to. Their experiences are not your experience. We all deal with our different experiences in different ways. There is no set timeline for getting past or getting over a trauma.   In some ways, I'm in the same place as you. That doesn't mean I know exactly how you feel or what you're going through. But I can relate to some of the things you said in this post. I crave pain when I experience intense emotions like guilt, shame, anger... My current boyfriend (the only person who knows about my past in detail) tells me that what my ex did to me was not my fault. I have a really hard time believing him. I feel like I deserved to be treated the way my ex treated me. I still act in that way sometimes with my current boyfriend. He picks up on it and tries to remind me that I have a choice and a say.   People think I'm a responsible person who is really smart and good at getting things done. They don't understand that every day I get back to my dorm room and feel like collapsing or crying because I'm just so exhausted and worn out and tired of everything, tired of keeping up this "perfect" front, tired of wearing a happy mask, tired of living. So I cut. I cut and cut and cut to hide the pain. Why am I hiding the pain in a way that leaves a visible, physical way? I don't know. I just know I need to. Cutting can become an addiction and if it does it's like any other addiction. There's a craving and it's impossible to think about anything else until you satisfy that craving. When you try to stop, your mental state might get worse... You feel lost and helpless and you know that if you do it again, you'll only be disappointing people and setting yourself back. For me, it has become an addiction.   You don't want it to become an addiction for you. A broad way to answer the question, "Why do people self-harm?" is to say that it's a coping mechanism. But to get past it, you need to figure out specifically why you do it, like you are with this post. Then maybe you can find a different way to cope that satisfies that need. Obviously this process can be a long, difficult one... I'm still in the middle of it.  If you ever want/need to talk about this or anything, you can PM me. I'll be here. I'm open to talking about this further if you'd like.
safetyindarkness	I do a similar thing, though my PTSD is related to abuse growing up and especially to my ex rapist bf of 2 years. But I seem to dive into anything even relating a bit, when I'm on my own anyway. I watch Law And Order: SVU ALL the time. I'm subscribed to subreddits and Facebook pages about it. I read every news story that comes up. It's probably not good for me, but I can't help it. Like, I know SVU is going to have some graphic scenes I can't watch, and I know reading about how one attacker tracked down and reinjured his victim is going to trigger anxiety about my ex doing the same, but I do it anyway. I don't really get it...

safetyindarkness	My boyfriend and I have this tapping system for when I'm anxious or uncomfortable. If I ever want to stop what we're doing, all I have to do is tap him anywhere 2 or 3 times in quick succession. He knows this means that I'm anxious about something, but I don't have to say anything and he will still back off, come closer, or help me calm down in whatever way. It's an easy way to communicate that something makes me anxious that uses the symptoms (in my case, tapping/repetitive movement) of anxiety to get a point across and doesn't put additional strain on me to communicate in a specific manner.

safetyindarkness	Sixth grade Spanish class. We were playing a review game. The class was split into two teams. One boy, "Chris", was up for one team and a girl was up for the other team.   The teacher, Mrs. M, asked a question. Chris hits his buzzer first and gave an answer. Mrs. M said that he was wrong and asked the girl if she knew the answer. She gave the same answer as Chris did, and Mrs. M said that she was right and awarded her team the point.  Chris starts yelling that he had given the correct answer first and his team is backing him up. Mrs. M tells him to go sit down. They are still arguing when Chris starts stomping back to his desk and is rounding the corner of his row when something goes whizzing by his head and hits the window. Mrs. M had picked up a chalkboard eraser and chucked it at his head while his back was turned.   Of course, this escalated the argument into a full-blown screaming match between the two. Everyone who had been standing up for Chris fell silent. Chris was eventually sent to the principal's office and the review game continued, much more quietly and reserved than before.   Mrs. M was suspended and eventually fired because of this incident. I later learned from a retired teacher's aide that this had been the last straw for Mrs. M. Mrs. M had already been in trouble for other innapropriate behavior, including tying a student to a chair in some sort of demonstration. 
safetyindarkness	Both my families (parents divorced) do this. I have never seen it as a weird thing, it's just saying that the animals are a part of the family, too. At Christmas, we often get presents signed "from Santa", "from (person in the family)", and "from (pet's name)". It doesn't really mean anything in particular; obviously the presents are from a person, not the pet, but it's just a thing we do. My dad's dog "gave" my dad a card for his birthday a few days ago; I signed it from the dog because it was a funny card about dogs, and I had already given him my own card signed from me.

safetyindarkness	My dad told me a similar story about his first car. It was a late 70s/early 80s black Trans Am, I think, and he sold it to a friend of a friend. So the new owner and his younger brother go out in it one night. I think the older brother got drunk and decided to drive them home. They crashed at high speed into a telephone pole on the passenger side. The pole occupied where the passenger seat was supposed to be; the passenger door was wrapped halfway around the pole.   They used the jaws of life and found the younger brother's body completely destroyed (someone else used the term "a sack of broken bones") under the dashboard. The older brother didn't die, but suffered brain damage and is now functional (he holds a simple, minimum wage job) but has no memory of the accident and doesn't realize his brother is dead or that he is the cause of his brother's death.   One of the worst parts is that shortly after the accident, while the older brother was still in the hospital, the family's next door neighbor bought the totaled car to fix it up for himself. He kept it in his driveway and refused to cover it up. The parents had to walk outside every day for months seeing the car that handicapped their older son and that their younger son had died in. The neighbor didn't care; he wanted to fix up the car and he didn't want to "hide" it, as it was, at the time, a cool car to own.

I posted about it before, but don't have the energy to go into it all right now.
safetyindarkness	Nightmares and Anxiety - How Do I Stop It? | I (19F) have been having a rough time these past few weeks with anxiety about my rapist ex. Some of it is still just general anxiety about sex and the acts, which bother me immensely, though my current boyfriend and I have been able to perform those acts successfully in the past few months. But I've been having awful nightmares and horrible anxiety relating to some of the things my current boyfriend posted here about 6 months ago. This is his post:   https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/4gdkvy/girlfriends_ex_and_rapist_still_in_the_picture/  So anyway, I'm terrified. I've been having horrible flashbacks and nightmares and haven't been able to get much sleep. But one of the things that has been bothering me a lot lately, and for seemingly no reason, is the thought that my ex will just show up or is already right outside the door and is trying to get in. This is a ridiculous thought for a number of reasons, but I can't help it. Yes, my ex showed up at my room randomly last year, but he hasn't contacted me since. I am in a different building this year, though on the same campus. All dorms require swiping an ID card to enter, unless someone lets you in. I don't believe that anyone associated with the school could give out my room number or "address" legally. Besides this, I've been spending all of my time (every night) in my boyfriend's single room with him. He is in a different building, again with all the same safety precautions, and my ex knows nothing about him (not even his first name). We lock the door every night before we go to bed, or it keeps me up and anxious. However, the door shifts slightly and makes noises when there's a change in air pressure. I know this is the reason, but my anxious brain will tell me that it's my ex outside the door, jiggling it, and trying to get in. My boyfriend has been super patient and supporting and helpful this entire time, and as far as this door thing goes, he's been very reassuring. If I flinch, he reminds me it's the air pressure and rubs my back or shoulder. If I'm having a nightmare, he wakes me up, checks on me, turns the light on and makes me get up and walk around if I have to, or just holds me til I fall back asleep. He has really been amazing. He lets me have my space when I need it, and we have a system that consists of me tapping him when something is too much or too overwhelming or anxiety-inducing so I don't have to talk, which can be hard for me in those types of situations. Anyway, I want to know what I can do to make myself feel better or how I can stop these nightmares and this stupid anxiety about the door. Obviously, there's so much more to all of this, but I'm too tired to go into it right now. 
safetyindarkness	Is this the inspiration for the Potion Seller video?
safetyindarkness	I really love this response. Thank you for your suggestions. I really hope to be able to send her something along these lines at some point... I'm thinking October 23rd? We'll see how and if this progresses. 
safetyindarkness	I'm only 18, going on 19 in a couple weeks. So if you're right about the age thing, then yes, I'm stuck. 
safetyindarkness	That's a pretty good idea, but she will want details or she will demand another day if I respond with something like that. She has to look like the "good mother" driving an hour and a half each way to go visit her only daughter for her birthday. I probably am just going to continue the silence until FAFSA time, at least. But my dad has been getting on her about FAFSA, and she will listen to him slightly better than she'll listen to me, so I'm letting him work on that for now. I'm really not independent and I don't know if it would be worth it right now. Thank you for your reply, though!
safetyindarkness	Yeah, it makes no sense, but she didn't address that fact at all. She shut my phone off, so now she has no reliable way to contact me. That's her fault. I'm not going to just keep bending to her every whim and answer her on Facebook because she decided to cut her main form of contact with me.  My goal in this interaction? Two more FAFSAs and to see my younger brothers. However, I know I'm not going to be able to see them without her, and she's just going to make me angry/upset and mess with my head while I'm there and I won't be able to enjoy spending time with them, because I'll be too busy holding back anger or tears. I haven't seen them since August, and probably won't see them until winter break, if I can find a way to do so. I actually just discovered today, through my dad, that she has already thrown away half the stuff in my room and given my bed to her new tenant, aka her new daughter.  I do not want to keep letting her feel like she is the "winner". She doesn't deserve to be in control. She doesn't deserve the love of the kids she abused. She is not always right. I want her to know that. And in time, she will know that. I'll make sure of it.  Like I said in my post, I'm basically LC with her. I haven't spoken to/seen her since August, and I've ignored all her messages since then (she only sent about four). 
safetyindarkness	I agree; thanks for the support. I still haven't opened the message, nor have I responded. 
safetyindarkness	I agree that it's all about control. And now that I am outside of her direct control, she is trying to find ways to get it back. But I refuse to let her control and abuse me anymore. I don't want to be on her good side, and I want to make that clear to her one day; she doesn't deserve the love of the children she abused. My 17-year-old brother stood up for himself against her much earlier than I did, and for the most part, she leaves him alone now. Every once in awhile, she tries to assert herself over him again, but he has become so apathetic about it that he ignores her almost completely. 
safetyindarkness	If my dad fills out the FAFSA, I will get little to no financial aid because his wife makes enough money that I wouldn't qualify, despite them having 3 kids in college between them. Any response denying her what she wants or calling her out will only prompt argument and fighting. That's one thing I still have a lot of trouble handling. I burst into tears if someone yells at me, and I feel this insurmountable need to please and make the person who's upset with me happy. I'm definitely never going to beg to have her back in my life as a mom, and she knows that, but she's waiting for me to come crawling back because I need something from her. I wish there was something else I could do about my tuition, but my dad put it this way: "Two more years, and you never have to deal with her again." 
safetyindarkness	I'm not telling her I have or plan to get a new phone and there is no way in hell she gets my new number. While you're right that she might see it as a win, I'm still pretty bitter and I don't want to give her the satisfaction hahaha.
safetyindarkness	I'd love if we could do that, but if my dad fills out the FAFSA, I will get little to no financial aid because his wife makes enough money that I wouldn't qualify, despite them having 3 kids in college between them.
safetyindarkness	NMom Shut My Phone Off A Few Weeks Ago; Contacted Me Yesterday On Facebook | Lurker here; have only posted a couple times; sorry for bad formatting and long rant. Need advice. Thanks!  I (18F) am in my sophomore year of college. Prior to college, I lived with my Nmom and three brothers. On the weekends, I stayed with my dad. Last year, when I started college, I began LC with my Nmom, but went home every weekend to my dad's house. Over the winter break, I stayed at her house for two weeks, and at my dad's the second two weeks. My dad and full brother (17M) helped me to keep it a secret whenever I was staying with my dad, letting her believe I had not come home at all, and that I had to go back to school early over winter break for my work study. This past summer, I told her, via text, that I was staying with my dad. This was a huge step for me; while my 17-year-old brother had been allowed to spend summers with our dad, I was expected to stay at home to watch my other two half brothers (11M and 9M) and feed the pets (Nmom is an animal hoarder). I got my first real job this past summer (which was my excuse for staying at my dad's house), and after we found out she had screwed up my financial aid (after months of bugging her to do it) by not turning it in on time, my second real job just off campus. Through a fluke, I also got back my work study job, as an internship instead. So now I have two jobs, and am taking a full courseload of 15 credits. This has kept me too busy to go home at all this year.  I saw her twice over the course of the summer, and haven't stayed at her house since last winter break.  About a week into the new semester she texted me:  "How would u feel about me renting out Ur room for a couple of months?"  I was extremely upset; I broke down crying to my boyfriend. Her "renting out my room" would essentially mean that my two younger brothers would be told to throw out everything in my room (she would never do it herself) and I would lose everything there. Also, it just made me realize how little I've been able to see the two younger boys, and that she would soon be disowning me and no longer allow me to see them at all. I love my brothers; I want to be able to see them. I didn't respond immediately, and had to go to class and work not long after. About four hours later, I receive another text from her:  "I am no longer paying Ur phone bill. If u thought u were going to keep ignoring me n not answer text after text u played the wrong game. I am done playing."  And she cut off my cell service not long after. She's been threatening me with this for years. But she's never gone through with it before, as she knows it's the only thing she has left to hold over my head. She did it this time, cutting off her only reliable way to get in contact with me, as well as cutting the last major thing she has over me other than the two FASFA forms I will need to finish college.  My dad and step mom helped me get a new phone and number under their plan the very next weekend. I've been careful giving out my new number, and my dad and 17-year-old brother have agreed not to tell her I have a new phone. So, she has no idea that I have it. Because she thinks she managed to cut me off completely and that I don't have a phone anymore, she messaged me on Facebook yesterday:  "How about we come up n take u n (boyfriend) out for dinner for your birthday on Saturday the 22nd?"  My birthday is in a couple weeks and this is the first contact she's made since she cut off my phone. I haven't opened the message (read it in the notification bar), so she doesn't know I've seen it. I almost never post on Facebook, so it's unlikely she'll know I was on Facebook at all unless Facebook notifies her that I recently liked something. It bugs me that she thinks I've jut completely forgotten about the phone thing and is trying to play the "good mother" for my birthday. I just don't know if I should open the message and respond or continue to pretend I never saw it. What should I do? Do I respond? If so, what do I say?  TL;DR: Nmom wanted to rent out my room to a stranger, cut off my cell service, hasn't contacted me since, and now wants to take me out for my birthday as if nothing happened.
safetyindarkness	I know. Thank you, though!
safetyindarkness	I'd love to, but I still have to get two more FASFAs from this woman. What I was thinking about when she first sent me the message saying she was shutting off my phone was "I've been playing your game for 18 years. It's finally over. And I won." I really wish I could send that. 
safetyindarkness	My Nmom used to have something of a "song of the month" type of thing. She would listen to the radio, but once a song caught her attention and she liked it, that was the only song that got played. On repeat. For a month straight. She would listen to one song for hours and hours and sing along to it over and over and over. It drove my brothers and I absolutely insane. I hate almost all of those particular songs now. At least we were listening to current music on the radio, but only until she found her next "song of the month". 
safetyindarkness	When we initially started dating, neither of us had a problem with the age difference. I didn't look up to him because of his age or see him any differently because of it, either. I've always been really mature for my age (I had been responsible for the care of my three younger brothers and the animals at the house since I was very young), so it seemed to make sense at the time for me to date someone I felt was more mature than most other people my age.   As far as the power imbalance, I think it was more because of our personalities, rather than our ages, though I don't disagree that there was a power imbalance.  Thank you for giving me your spine perspective on it. Like I said, I've been having trouble distinguishing the lines between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in these situations. This was one of the more "reserved" (for lack of a better description) encounters I had with him. After the first few times, the experiences quickly escalated into what was clearly (something I'm now aware of, but didn't realize at the time) rape.
safetyindarkness	I was very unsure of myself at the time and still am unsure about the whole experience. I didn't tell him to stop, nor did I say "no" at any point. I am a very submissive person and almost always listen to and do what the people around me want for me to do. We had been working up to that point because I was scared. I confessed that I was scared and nervous and that it hurt, but I never told him to stop explicitly. I just followed his lead as best I could until I was no longer meeting his needs/expectations, at which point, he took control of the situation. So I'm still not sure what this is. While later encounters were definitely rape, this and some others I'm still not sure of. But I figured it made the most sense to start at the beginning. Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts.
safetyindarkness	Did I Lose My Virginity To Rape? | I (18F) was in a long-term (2 years) relationship with my rapist. As I've only really become aware and come to terms with that fact somewhat recently, there are still some blurry lines as far as which of my experiences with him were rape as opposed to "normal" sexual encounters.  Anyway, because of this, I've been wondering where the lines are drawn and have been thinking back to the first time I "went all the way" with him.  I was 16, he was 19. We were maybe 4 or 5 weeks into our relationship, and had been slowly working our way up to actual sex. The night it happened, I had still been extremely scared/worried/anxious about it. I told him that I was still scared and wasn't sure if I wanted to do it. He said that it would be fine, that he would be careful, that he knew what he was doing, and I didn't have to worry. I said okay, and went quiet again. I just listened and moved to what he said/told me to do. He had experience, but this was my first time. He put on a condom (the first, last, and only time he did that). He moved me to where he wanted me, and got started. When I didn't/couldn't do what he wanted me to, he had me change position (where I had my back in the corner partially against the back of my futon bed, partially against my dresser, the arm of the futon digging under my ribs) and he climbed on top of me. I remember being so nervous I could barely talk, but I told him it sort of hurt. He told me that it always hurt the first time and that it wasn't really anything to worry about, that it was normal. He eventually finished and got off. We didn't talk about it again until the next day, when he asked me over text how I felt about it. I told him the truth; that I had been scared and nervous and that it had hurt. He simply reassured me that everything was fine and said that he knew it would hurt. It's been nearly three years and I'm still not sure how I do or should feel about it. Was this rape? Or just an awkward first time? Is this normal? How should I feel about it?

MartyBitchTits	Does my lack of caring mean I'm depressed or just an asshole? | I've never really been one to care about much or even pretty much anything. I've had many girlfriends but never really loved any of them. I care about my family, but I accept they will die some day and all it makes me feel is "meh". I have a job where I get paid a lot of money to do very little and have no worries about debt. But I still feel like it the way I do everything else; that it's an inconvenience. I do it to survive. I'm not suicidal, but at the same time, I wouldn't care if I died tomorrow. It would just be an end.   I have many hobbies that I enjoy, but nothing I'm passionate about enough for me to pursue it. I just simply want to be left alone. Doing things for/with others is exhausting. I have a few friends that I keep around just so I don't go mad by being alone too much. But even they can get on my nerves at times.   I dream of buying a boat and just sailing away from civilisation with my dog. (The one thing on this earth I give enough of a shit about to care if it lives or dies.) What is wrong with me? Am I a sociopath? I don't want to hurt anyone, but also I don't really care if people do get hurt. It maybe a bit of a cliché, but I see the rest of humanity as a virus, more than anything else.
MartyBitchTits	BOOM! HEADSHOT!
MartyBitchTits	Yeah, you can leave the drives as separate drives if you want, you'll just have 4 different drives showing up in windows. You can connect the drives through a fast USB port (3.0) or an eSATA port and they will be just as fast as a regular drive
MartyBitchTits	Yeah, I didn't realise that at the time of setting it up and by the time I noticed, I had transferred all my data to the disks. Luckily I have a cloud backup solution, so if the disks end up corrupted I can reformat the drives and get the data back through the cloud. But a RAID 1 would be a better solution.
MartyBitchTits	I had a similar problem a couple of months ago. I bought an [Icy Dock](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817198061&cm_re=icy_dock-_-17-198-061-_-Product) and 4 X [2 TB WD Greens](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA67S5PS9751&cm_re=wd_green-_-22-136-344-_-Product) and configured them in a RAID0 array. This was the cheapest option I could find for storage. It has the added bonus of only needing one free USB 3.0 port to work.

MartyBitchTits	Shouldn't these big Internet companies that are trying to protect net neutrality be going to the ISP's and saying "Look, if you throttle the internet, we're not going to be buying your bandwidth. In fact, we'll set up our own network and offer it at a ridiculously low price and force you out of the market."  - Much like Google has done in a limited capacity with Google Fibre. - Why are large companies like Google, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook letting Comcast, Verizon, et al, put a gun to their heads? Surely massive companies like these hold more clout that a couple of ISP's? They must realise that if they let them get away with it, then they are going to have to start paying more for high speed bandwidth as well?﻿
MartyBitchTits	It is a Black Vortex MB174U3S-4SB. It doesn't need drivers. My Intel eXtensible USB 3.0 Host controller is up to date with the latest drivers as well. It's unlikely that all three USB ports on the laptop are faulty, and they are fine when using the USB 2.0 hub. I'm at a loss.
MartyBitchTits	Laptop won't recognise my USB 3.0 Dock. | I recently bought an Icy Dock USB 3.0 hard drive enclosure. It is USB 3.0 certified. My laptop has USB 3.0 as standard on all it's ports except for a USB Type C port. When I plug my Icy Dock into the USB port nothing happens. The dock is not detected. But, for some reason, when I use an old USB 2.0 hub, it is detected, but at significantly slower speeds. I've reinstalled the Intel USB 3.0 Host Controller drivers but this doesn't seem to make any difference. The biggest problem is I got the dock to be a backup solution and a media center.  Which means that I've ripped all my Blu-rays to the dock. Unfortunately, Because it only connects through USB 2.0, it doesn't allow the bandwidth to stream the HD movies without stuttering. I've no idea what can be causing the USB 3.0 port to not recognise the dock.

I hate going to stupid shit that I don't care about. I'm 34 years old, shouldn't I just be able to do what I want to do?  If it's not sitting in my favourite bar or going out with my little group of friends, I really don't give a rats ass about it. I'm getting too old to do shit that other people expect of me.
MartyBitchTits	The second law of thermodynamics tends to agrees with you. But there is no spirituality to it. Entropy always increases. The body is an open system. When you die, your body will convert most of its energy in the decomposing process and use it to start various processes that will spread "your" energy back into the universe. This doesn't mean that you'll be in any way aware of it. It's simply a process that has to happen to keep the entropy in the Universe increasing.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axG9HuqViDY) video explains it very well.
MartyBitchTits	Back in the era of the Cold war, and probably now as well, a space-based platform would have been highly desired by both sides, as it would mean cutting down the time to hit your enemies to literal minutes. If you could strike your enemies weapons infrastructure and take out most of their means to retaliate, you'd have a higher chance of minimising your own casualties and be in a stronger position after the fighting was over. It was obviously a desirable plan, as there wouldn't be a treaty to outlaw it, if it wasn't.
MartyBitchTits	The energy involved in deorbiting an asteroid large enough to cause a global disaster, even from LEO, is far too much to make it worthwhile. It's a lot easier throwing thousands of nukes at someone than it is to deorbit an asteroid. watch Scott Manley's explanation of deorbiting a moon in KSP. It gives a good estimate of what you'd need to do it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G01NoaTM46o
MartyBitchTits	It's very efficient, if it means getting around the The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 that states that no nuclear platform is to be placed in orbit around the earth. also, look up FOBS as another way of getting around said treaty.
MartyBitchTits	He's Jewish.
MartyBitchTits	Sorry, couldn't think of the name for them, and I though asking for a "NAS without all the network gubbin's" would have just confused people. But those one's from ICY DOCK look exactly like what I'm after. Thank you.
MartyBitchTits	Don't think anyone sells enclosures for anything other than SATA these days. But I've still got my cable that I bought for those drives. So hopefully I can knock something up. Luckily the IDE drives are the lower capacity of the bunch so I might just get rid of them. Looks like I'm gonna go with an ICY DOCK enclosure, that seems to be my best/cheapest solution. But, thanks for the info.
MartyBitchTits	Homemade "NAS" help. | Over the years I've managed to collect a lot of old hard drives from various builds and I would like to start using them as a large external Hard Drive. I have about 6 drives of various types (2.5"/3.5" IDE/SATA) with a capacity of about 8TB. Right now they are sitting on a shelf with various versions of Windows on them and thousands of gigabytes of data that has all been backed up to the cloud, so they are not serving any purpose right now. So, instead of gathering dust, I'd like to make a semi-mobile external hard drive with them. Ideally very cheaply. I've looked at some NAS's online and they are very expensive and have a whole lot of networking features that I don't need. I would ideally like a combination multi-drive bay that can sit beside my computer and can be hot-swapped from one drive to the next using my USB to SATA/IDE cable that I already own or, even better, comes with it's own SATA to USB 3 interface. All I see online is very expensive NAS solutions that have integrated networking and their own processors, all of which I don't need as it will literally sit next to my PC and be plugged in through the USB port in the back of my computer. Does anyone know of any vendor that supplies such a thing?

MartyBitchTits	It's Social Blade. It ranks YouTube channels.
MartyBitchTits	Social Blade (and YouTube in general) doesn't really take into account how many subscribers a channel has when calculating its worth. Views, watch time and engagement (likes, dislikes and comments specifically) are all much more important than how many subscribers a channel has and they will affect a channel's score considerably. So there's a disparity between subscriber count and the actual popularity of the channel. AH get more subscribers a month than FH, but the ones that FH gets are more engaged with the content they create.
MartyBitchTits	Yeah, I meant that it was inconsistent in the sense that it relies on how many views each video gets and the percentage of people not using adblock.

Not being a fan of the taste of cum, she aimed it away from herself just as I was at the height of pleasure, but, unknown to me, she also kept a tight grip of my dick.

MartyBitchTits	/r/tifu deleted my post after gaining 4000+ upvotes and hitting the front page. | OK, this was a few years ago now. But what the hell. I was gonna use a throwaway for this but, fuck it! One night, my friend and I were in our local bar, we were out having a good time when these two girls walked in. He recognised one of them straight away as an old crush that he hadn't seen in years. We had been drinking through most of the day and we were pretty hammered. My friend turned to me and said that we should go over and talk to them, as he has always wanted to bang this girl. something about "The one that got away". I looked at them both and they were both relatively attractive , so I agreed. We wandered over and started to chat and my friend, being the smooth bastard he is, really got everyone comfortable with each other by making some funny remarks and generally being a charming douche. His crush seem to be really in to it, and him, and was very chatty with both of us. Her friend, on the other hand, was very quiet and quite reserved. Thinking that I may as well go for it, I started to talk to her and focus on her more than the other two. When I talked to her she seemed a little weird (Clue number 1). I chalked it down to the fact that she was drunk and shy and was a little unsure of these two drunken idiots that had crashed their girls night out. Eventually, after a lot of coaxing, she started to come out of her shell a bit more and enjoy herself. The night went on and we all ended up getting pretty plastered. My friend and I even more so. Eventually the night came to a close and we all walked out of the bar. The girl that my friend was in to was now arm in arm with him and walking down the road to the taxi-rank. so, me and this other girl let them drift ahead of us while I took advantage of their absence and made my move. We stopped for a bit and kissed. This was my second clue that something wasn't right. <-Here's clue number fucking 2!! She kissed me in a very peculiar way, the kind of way that young kids kiss when they are in their early teens. There was entirely too much tongue and her mouth was WAY too open. Anyway, my drink-addled mind thought about it for a nano-second then went back to thinking about the possibility that I may be getting laid tonight. After our brief encounter we got to the taxi-rank and my friends girl said "Hey, you guys want to come back to our house?" My friend and I looked at each other and, in a way that didn't make us look too eager, agreed to go with them. The taxi journey only lasted 5 - 10 minutes and also went by my house which made me happy as I was thinking "Sweet, I don't even have to walk far tomorrow morning to go home!". We arrived at her place and started to get comfortable in the living room. It didn't take long for my friend and his partner to disappear into one of the bedrooms, which left me alone with this girl. We started kissing again and this time it was even worse than before. Her mouth was so wide that I felt that I was getting tongue-fucked by a basking shark (Clue number 3). Anyway, things progressed and I asked her if she wanted to go to the bedroom. She eagerly agreed and off we popped. We got into the room and I proceeded to undress. Quickly getting my kit off and jumping into the bed. She on the other hand decided to get undressed and then disappeared down the hall for a few minutes. I was doing my usually pre-coitus hygiene checks, when I heard her friend in the other room say to her to "Go back in the other room!" That's when it hit me, that she was walking about naked in this house and interrupting her friend while she and my friend were having sex in the next room (Clue number 4). Again, my alcohol-soaked brain chalked it up to the fact that she was drunk and didn't care. Anyway, who am I to judge other people's living arrangements? She came back, eventually and got into bed with me. We started with some more (very open mouthed) kissing and I fondled her breasts. She seemed to like this so I kept doing it with one hand as my other hand explored lower. I started to rub her clit and she really started to respond, so I pushed in a little deeper and went to slide my finger into her. Suddenly, she grabbed my hand and pulled it away from her vagina. "I don't like that, not in there." she snapped. All I could think was "Ah dammit!! I've managed to bag myself a virgin... Welp! my workload has just increased tenfold!" I was rather disappointed but I reassured her that I would be gentle. She bolted up and gave me a look that simply said "What the fuck are you talking about" (Clue number 5) I resigned myself that I was going to have to take it slow if I wanted to get laid, I reached out and tried to start rubbing her clit again as she had obviously enjoyed it before but her fingers beat me to it. I though to myself "Oh well, if she needs a little manual action to get the fires going, who am I to complain?" but suddenly she started going at herself with what can only be described as frenzied enthusiasm. She furiously frigged herself for a couple of minutes then suddenly made a sound as guttural as an Alaskan throat singer. This shocked me sober a little bit but I was still far too drunk to put two and two together. She started to get really into what she was doing to herself so I took the opportunity and took her hand and placed it on my now aching balls and motioned her to start to give me a hand job. Suddenly she snatched her hand back and said "I'm not touching you there!" This confused the living hell out of me and sobered me up completely. I thought to myself "Fuck this shit! If the selfish bitch ain't even gonna give me a handjob then why the fuck did she ask me to come home with her, get naked and jump into bed with me?!" At that point I said fuck it and rolled over and decided to go to sleep, which was uncomfortable with my massive blue balls. The next morning I woke up with the mother of all hang-overs and wanted to get home as quickly as possible. But first I had to take a piss (of what I could only imagine after the previous nights cock-teasing, would consist of simply semen and blood). I managed to drag myself out of bed and hunted down the nearest bathroom. I walked into the bathroom. But, something was off. I'd never seen a bathroom like this before. There was a guard-railing around the toilet, the bath was a walk-in tub and in the corner was a long red cord with the word "Emergency" printed on a label hanging from it. Suddenly the horror hit me and I went completely white. It all started to make hideous, cringe-worthy sense. I ran back in to the room and grabbed my clothes, put them on in world record pace, threw my shoes on (I didn't even bother looking for my socks) and ran down the stairs. Unfortunately to get to the front door, I would have to pass through the sitting room, and I could already hear that my friend and his girl were up and already making plans for the day. I calmly opened the door and there they were, sitting on the couch drinking tea and chatting away, quite the thing. The girl looked up at me and instantly said "Enjoy yourself last night." I went about 40 shades of purple and red and then looked over to my friend who was sitting on the sofa with the biggest smile on his face that I have ever seen. All doubt in my mind was now gone but I had to ask the girl anyway. I started to mumble "I... Is... Your friend..." I didn't even get the words out when the young lady in front of me, with a growing smile on her face interrupted me "Handicapped?... Yes, yes she is." I couldn't believe it, what the fuck had I just done? But she continued: "Oh, but she's not my friend, I'm her carer. I look after her" My friend burst out laughing and that's when I knew that he had known for quite some time. I marched past them and I got the fuck out of there. I ran down to my house, switched my phone off, went to my bedroom and didn't get out of bed until 2 days later.

MartyBitchTits	I don't get all the hate TWD gets. I've watched it from the start and loved every minute of it and the episode tonight was utterly, brutally intense and brilliantly acted. Negan is going to be one of the best villains of all time. But, then again, I've never been one for following what other people like. I couldn't stand Breaking Bad, thought Game of Thrones was just boring and I don't give a shit about Westworld (Even though I am a HUGE sci-fi fan.) Guess I just like doing my own thing.

MartyBitchTits	Probably not the right place to ask. | Hey, I have a question. I'm trying to find out if anyone has had any success in whitelisting a channel on youTube with uBlock Origin? I'd like to support my favourite channel (Funhaus) and a few other content creators by whitelisting them. Unfortunately, YouTube's URL structure seems to make this impossible. I can whitelist the main Funhaus URL but every time a video starts, uBlock automatically starts up and blocks the ads. Frankly, I think your content deserves every penny it generates so I'd like to do my small part. I've searched for ways to do it on the internet but most of that covers AdBlock Plus.
MartyBitchTits	Unfortunately I live in the UK, so YouTube Red isn't available for me. But I'll definitely be looking in to it when it launches here. 
MartyBitchTits	Because the extension starts every time I add a new tab in my browser. Even if I have turned it off in another tab, it won't be turned off when I launch a new tab for a video and I seldom remember to turn it off once the video starts. I watch hundreds of YouTube videos a day (I don't have or want a TV) So I would really like a workaround.
MartyBitchTits	Playing Mindsweeper on 4 Desktop Operating Systems at once with a smartphone. | 
MartyBitchTits	A little video I made where I used 2 laptops, a Smartphone and a virtual machine to play minesweeper remotely over 4 operating systems. Windows XP, Windows 10, Windows 7 and Android: Marshmallow. The bangs you hear is my fingers tapping the screen as I use the phone. I used a screen capture app on my phone to get the video, hence why the quality isn't the best. I started off with connecting one of my laptops (Running Windows 7) with TeamViewer through my Android phone. I then connected that laptop to another laptop running Windows 10. Once I had set up a remote connection to the two laptops, I booted up VirtualBox on the Windows 10 machine and loaded a copy of Windows XP in a virtual machine. Then all I did was load up minesweeper and play (Badly). You can skip to 3:25 if you don't want to watch me play minesweeper. Obviously I could have went deeper if I installed a virtual machine on the virtual machine but I really couldn't be bothered. Enjoy!

MartyBitchTits	I never said it would be "easy".. I said it wouldn't be within the realms of impossibility. Most of the missions we've sent to other worlds have failed, that's just the risk of interplanetary flight. Is that a reason to stop trying? I'd like to think that if we were adamant that we were someday going to send a probe to Europa (Which seems to be the case), a trial run to one of the more extreme moons of Jupiter would be a sound investment. If we could land successfully on Io then the science and experience (Not to mention the amazing views) we could get back from that mission would be invaluable for a future mission to Europa. If we stopped every mission that was "risky" we'd still be wondering what that big round thing in the night sky was.
MartyBitchTits	OK, let me answer some of your points.  -We do have very detailed maps of Io. Galileo and Voyager 1 & 2 mapped the surface very well. In fact, we've got better cartography of Io than we had of Titan when we landed the Huygens probe.  http://www.space.com/14977-jupiter-moon-io-global-map-photos.html   -While the DeltaV requirements would be more than a Mars mission, there would definitly be a way to aerobrake, by using the vast atmosphere of Jupiter. I'm sure some orbital models could be concieved where this would be possible. Even if it wasn't, lots of probes have entered into orbit of the Jovian system, Galileo is one such probe. Can't see this being a massive problem.  -We've landed probes on surfaces without atmospheres before, Look at the Luna and Surveyor missions of the 60's and 70's and the Chang'e 3 mission of this decade. Plus, all the experience gained with the NEAR Shoemaker and the Rossetta missions really make this not a big problem.  -This one is easy. Right now Jupiter has a probe flying through its magnetosphere, The Juno mission. That spaceraft has adequate enough protection to last the 1.4 years of its mission time. It's currently flying through belts of radiation a lot worse than anything an Io lander would experience as it's in a polar orbit. It's not difficult for a team at NASA/ESA to figure out a way to reduce the risk even more. This isn't even an issue, to be honest.   There just seems to be a lack of interest in the moon. Maybe because everyone is more interested in its little brother, Europa and what lies beneath the Ice. But every time I see pictures of Io, I think it is fascinating. Watching volcanos erupt 330Km into space is unbelievable. Now imagine watching that from the surface?
MartyBitchTits	It boggles the mind that NASA hasn't put a lander on this moon yet. I understand that Mars is their priority right now, but think of the images we would get? It's the most volcanically active body in our solar system. I would love to see it from the surface.
MartyBitchTits	It was never very complicated for me. I've never been in debt so giving up using a bank account and their credit services was never an issue. I was never going to buy a house because where I live the house prices are beyond most young people's means and the only way to get a house was to apply for social housing. Right now I am in a flat that is owned by the owner of the pub/restaurant that I bounce in so he gives me an incredibly good deal rent wise and I look after all his graphic design and IT needs. Every penny I get gets hidden in my flat and I've got a good little nest egg that I can dip into whenever something unexpected comes along (Which isn't very often)  I just live well within my means. You don't need to spend money on stupid stuff like holidays (vacations) when your work consists of doing what you want, when you want and you're happy.
MartyBitchTits	Average schmo here, not paid taxes in 5 year. Nothing the government can do to me.
MartyBitchTits	There is nothing about travelling abroad that entices me to spend thousands on it. I don't like talking to people I don't know (I'm introverted), I can't stand the sun. I come from the Highlands of Scotland, anything over 20 degrees Celsius and I'm uncomfortable. I don't particularly care about other countries and their culture and I'm  not interest in learning about the people of other countries. But when I tell people I've never been abroad they look at me like I've pissed in their Cornflakes. I'm quite content with my own little patch of the world thanks very much.

MartyBitchTits	There's a great story by Arthur C Clarke called The Star which sees a Jesuit priest having a crisis of faith when he realises that the supernova remnant that they are investigating which wiped out an advanced and peaceful civilisation was the same star that heralded the birth of Jesus. It was also a Christmas episode of The Twilight Zone in the 90's. Still remember that episode all these years later.

MartyBitchTits	Silicon Valley did an episode about this very thing. when you overvalue a Startup the pressure to hit those over-inflated targets year after year makes the business model untenable. So much so that you're essentially screwing yourself by being too valuable. Having a valuation of a billion is good for the investors who may want to sell off their share of the company but, as for the company, it's pretty much suicide.

MartyBitchTits	AH is just too damn shouty. Can't watch any videos of theirs for longer than 5 minutes. Michael screaming down his mic and telling people to "Shut the fuck up" is really annoying. Gavin making annoying noises every five seconds is also kind of irritating. Funhaus is just better to watch, IMO. Maybe it's because I'm the same age as these guys, but I would rather watch a video with James, Adam, Lawrence, etc being funny than AH being shouty.

MartyBitchTits	Has anyone seen my dog? | 
MartyBitchTits	OK, I may be missing something here, But the shadows on the moon don't look right (Assuming this isn't two videos edited together) The Earth is fully lit from the front (i.e. From directly behind the camera.) Which means that, where the moon is in the picture, the probe should be flying close to or directly over the terminator. Which means the shadows the craters, ridges or mountains on the moons surface that we see, should be casting shadows a lot longer than what's shown. It almost looks like the moon is being illuminated from directly above the probe, instead of from behind it, like it should be. It's not that I don't believe that its an actual gif from a probe. I just don't want to give conspiracy theorists or Flat-earth nutcases any more ammo.

MartyBitchTits	The apps aren't the issue. As I said, I don't even use 99% of them. What I am unsure of is that if I'm not logged in to my Microsoft account, will I be able to still get critical security updates for Win10? That's really what's worrying me. All the software I use is 3rd party and doesn't use Microsofts UAC so that part of it isn't bothering me. But I would really like to log back in to my account for the security of having an updateable OS.
MartyBitchTits	This would be OK if I need to use Edge. But I rarely use anything apart from Firefox. I was really hoping for a way to reactivate my Microsoft account on Win10. I know it's not a major issue As all my software still functions and I never really use any of the built-in Microsoft apps, like Xbox, Calendar,  weather etc. But I don't know what may require the Microsoft account in the future. For instance, I have no idea if you have to be logged in to your Microsoft account if you want to recieve updates to Win10 or if they download regardless. Plus losing access to my code repository isn't ideal. Even though I do have a backup.
MartyBitchTits	Windows accounts disabled after download of virus. | I have Windows 10 on my laptop. The other day I was trying to watch a movie online (.WMV) when windows media player said I needed to download a codec. Not being on any sort of dodgy site, I agreed (Rookie mistake). It immediately started to install a program that my antivirus flagged straight away as a Trojan. So I stopped the download. But this is where it gets weird. I got a message from the notification center on Windows 10 just after my antivirus quarantined the install that I would; "have to restart my computer for the changes to your account to take place" This is when I started panicking and went into my Microsoft account and changed the password, as I didn't want to be locked out of my system if the computer restarted. Then the installer came back up and started to try and install the codec. I cancelled that right away. I thought I had successfully avoided the Trojan and everything was OK. But, now I can not log back in to my Microsoft account and a lot of functionality of windows is no longer available to me, as I am currently logged in as a "Local Account". I tried going to the account settings and logging back in to my Microsoft account but when I click the button to log back in nothing happens. there is a flash of a window trying to open, but then nothing happens. This wouldn't bother me much as all my third party programs are working fine but when I try to launch anything that requires a microsoft account to access (edge, office, or any of the tiled apps) I  get this message pop up. [Popup](http://imgur.com/ppHaH8R).  But the biggest thing is I can no longer log in to my Visual Studio 2015 account because it is a Microsoft product. I code for a living so I need to be connected to my account. I have also used the command prompt to create another account and give it administrative rights, but this account also has the same problem. i.e. It is logged on as a Local account and the sign in screen for My Microsoft account isn't working. I would like to know if there is a work around to log back into my account. I've had a look through the Powershell documentation but I can't find anything that will log you into your Microsoft account on it. Some help would be greatly appreciated.  Edit: [This](http://imgur.com/J91gdhE) is the window that I'm trying to log back into my account from. When I click on the "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" link, nothing happens.
MartyBitchTits	Yeah, but from the photons perspective (if a particle had one) that happened instantaneously. Relativity and all that.
Empirecapital	I'm new to this, what's wrong with me? | 4 months ago I went through depression. I always looked down on depression because I always thought it was a way for people to get attention and honestly in my culture being depressed means you're not being man enough and not for the fact that you may be going through some shit.  My ass got a reality check on that real quick.  So, 4 months ago I faced a new experience from several factors.   Physically: Night terrors, no appetite (-20 lbs in 3 and a half week), and constant throwing up.   Mentally: overthinking, a never ending fog/pressure like feeling in my head, emotionally weak.  Financially: unmotivated toward money  I'm a young man in his 20's, I consistently workout and am very ambitious. I love to read, to attain knowledge, and through that I was so happy. I felt untouchable in terms of goals, and my work ethic to reach them.   After that phase that lasted 3 months I don't feel the same way, but I want to go back to my way of normal.   4 months later I feel more emotional, scared. I have anxiety rush through me randomly on occasion. I start to have adrenaline rushes, jitters, nervousness   It's not constant, nor severe, but nerve racking.   I'm really scared due to the fact that I keep feeling like I am about to relapse. I feel like any second I might slip into this depressive phase and I am so fucking nervous for this to happen to me again. It took me a very long time to rid of this feeling depression has caused me.   But why is this all of a sudden happening to me? I always felt like I was physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually solid.   The only thing that's bothering me now physically is that I cannot stop waking up at exactly 7 even if I sleep at 1, 2, 3 AM and it causes me exhaustion and fatigue. I also quit smoking weed some time ago just because I think it would be better for now to avoid it.  What do you think this is? Is it a physical or mental health reason? Is my immune system shit? Do you have this feeling and how do you cope with It?  Honestly, I'm just trying to have a code of law I can follow when I begin to feel this way so I can avoid having this happen to me again so I'd appreciate all tips and tricks.   
Empirecapital	My father back in the 90's was working on a real estate deal and he had $100k in cash within a briefcase.  My brother is autistic and in his infancy would disappear a lot, he would just vanish and for the most part caused havoc in these moments.  Once this happened and as they searched the whole house they saw him in their bathroom dumping all of the money in the toilet. Soaked. Fluttered.  They put that shit in the dryer, bank accepted it all.

Empirecapital	Holy shit! I do the same thing! I call it the 3% rule. 1% goes towards a long term skill (for example learning marketing, investing, stocks, which should be done through structured platforms so that you can learn as if you're I'm a classroom setting, such as udemy.com, which you must eventually implement), 1% goes to an activity that I intend to do for the rest of my life (go to the gym, read books, etc), and 1% goes to learning a new topic (documentaries, TED talks, etc). The purpose of the new topic is to peak interest in other subjects you may not have known of. This takes pure willpower until you can make it a habit. Eventually 3% a day in improvements you improve 1,095% annually, which is much more than the average individual improves. I actually have been wanting to give people this rule and see how they've been doing. How've you been doing so far?
Empirecapital	I have so many options on the style/colors/variations I want to choose for a shoe brand I am building, but how do I pick the right designs? | So far I want 2-3 models of driving shoes (moccasins) 2-3 models of high-top sneakers 2-3 models of boots/Chelseas  My biggest concern is loosing brand focus/identity. Am I overthinking this and should I try several models within reason? Or am I under-thinking the importance of picking models for my initial launch?  I have options to do loafers, sneakers, boots, brogues, monk straps, wingtip brogues, whole cut, etc.   My main theme is a mix of bougie high end dress/formal footwear but also a casual boogie side too that consists of exotic skins and high tops/ moccasins.   I'd appreciate feedback!
Empirecapital	Thank you for that, I know it seems so obvious, and I'm not stupid enough not to realize it, but the way it ended just didn't feel like it added up with all the things we did throughout that month. I'm actually glad you said it although I've thought the same thing several times. It's easier to take it and accept it when it comes from someone else's thoughts and not your own. 
Empirecapital	What's very sad is that after all that all he had to offer was a drivers license and the fact that he can last 30 min. 😂
Empirecapital	Yeah, I agree 100% with this statement. I think you should be able to convey yourself in the best of manners, but I am also the individual to tell others to use their best judgement and sometimes the best judgement is to knock someone straight in the teeth. Not right away. Maybe not at all. Definitely not before you implement what was said above, but if things do go too far and you see a moment to teach a lesson (pun definitely intended ; ) then you should, in my opinion. Look everything seems so heavy as a high schooler and you're afraid of getting a backlash, but I don't think a typical school fight would expel you and you seem to have enough leverage for the fact that he bullied you to get a light punishment. And honestly, 5 years from now, this will all be a nice story to tell. That is all up to you obviously so do a cost/benefit analysis (you could get arrested). I might get down voted for this and I can see why, but sometimes things don't go as planned and this asshole classmate might be looking for a fight so if you choose to fight strike first, finish it, and hop out only when he is done. 
Empirecapital	I'd like to know how this goes because I've been in a very similar situation where this girl and I were digging each other (hung out almost everyday, going out to nice places, being sexual, etc) and then she gave me this priority thing with having to focus on her education and that's she's not ready for a relationship. She just came back yesterday from her spring break. And same for me, this was all two weeks ago. I chose not to reply probably due to being stubborn and that I had this shit depression. So if you do choose to reply let me know what happens. I'd like to see what the possible outcome could be.   Best of luck!

Empirecapital	My friend recently died in a motorcycle accident and for some reason him saying, "you're going to be so successful one day" just stuck with me. It's not those very words that mattered, but the experience and love behind it. I think about him everyday and I wish we could have shared a moment of the "I made it" feeling together. He was big on philanthropic efforts and that's why I admired him. He was raised as a trust fund baby, but without any of the  stereotypes. If you were in the hospital and barely new him he would be there with a bouquet of flowers and a lending hand. He had the most humble of hearts and I always wished that we could go and do something positive for those facing oppression globally together, which we did thoroughly plan on. Just sharing that experience would mean so much. We did start a campaign in his name to full fill his philanthropic dreams and I guess that's all we could do now. It truly is amazing that the weight of our dreams can just swiftly disappear from existence.
Empirecapital	Redditors who explore abandoned locations what is the strangest, craziest, or coolest thing you have found? | 
Empirecapital	They know how to have fun without drugs or alcohol, stands up for those who are mistreated, and their futures include philanthropic efforts. 
Empirecapital	How do I let him know that I need some alone time? | 
Empirecapital	*insert percentage" "call it fact" 5%-40% support extremist organization? Lmao, you're pulling numbers out of your ass & implying it as fact. Atleast try to bullshit me with a source.
Empirecapital	I just found an individual who does it, but is on visa so I definitely wouldn't be working with him, but definitely see what I can learn and implement. 
Empirecapital	I'd probably do so on request. In the middle east we always have maids so maybe if I provide one I would charge even more correct?
Empirecapital	I think your wrong. Some people come here from Kuwait for medical reasons. They stay at a hotel that charges $6k to 10k+ during the summers and the government pays for all of it. If I add to the lease by furnishing it, managing it, stocking it with the necessary items I can charge a premium that would still be less than the amount they pay. It's like an Airbnb, but with those who don't have price as an issue.  
Empirecapital	That is the question that I will not answer because I think I found it. 
Empirecapital	They get a certain amount from the government. Let's say the government sends you $5000 a month for living expenses. You're to lazy, unmotivated, stupid, whatever it may be to find an apartment. So you're paying out of pocket for anything that goes over $5000 so you would be more inclined to go with me if I charged $5000 or less so you have more spending money each month 
Empirecapital	Suns out with my royal Crest Slippers | 
Empirecapital	Thank you! You just spoke the truth! Many slipper designs are only meant for bold "goofyness". You really have to like them for yourself more than anyone else. 
Empirecapital	I got them from Vecchiomedici.com, but they don't have them on the website. If you sign up for there mailing list they send out exclusive designs. This one is called Royal Crest so just email them and ask!

Empirecapital	I sold, but I still get the shoes. Everything is 100% true and the effort to build such a business is too. I do not appreciate you calling my hard efforts a sham. I have a genuine passion for shoes so I will still post and if I did get the shoes from Vecchio Medici then I will say so when asked. 
Empirecapital	I was the co-founder 2 weeks back. I just licensed the custom platform to him and went in my way. Nonetheless the shoes are still something I love
Empirecapital	Thank you! 
Empirecapital	Hey bro read the legality of owning one of those. Even moving from state to state with them in the US can land you in trouble and I'm almost positive you cannot sell them. Obama put out some strict laws regarding Elephants in the US and I mean strict. 
Empirecapital	Is the a Blakewelt Reddit here? I feel kind of left out. | [removed]
Empirecapital	Karl Pilkington's bullshit detector.
Empirecapital	Reminds me of when I went bungee jumping. With every stair I climbed to get to the platform my confidence would dwindled. The only reason I jumped is because they don't give refunds. Guess who screamed like a girl! Me.
Empirecapital	I was pumped with adrenaline. The ropes did not hurt, but even if they did you would be glad to feel them because throughout the whole jump you're doubtful if they would actually catch you
Empirecapital	I wish that would've happened to me. When I looked up it seemed a lot shorter than when I was actually up there looking down. 
Empirecapital	I was to scared to think about having fun and as I jumped I was just frozen mentally to realize what was happening. 
Empirecapital	No problem!
Empirecapital	Enjoy your trip and thank you!
Empirecapital	I would go on counting calories for up to a year when I took things seriously. I'm not fat, but I gain it quickly. I never enjoy the feeling of built because even if I am built I think there is more work to be done and then guess what! When I gain the weight back and look at old pictures I'm astonished about how good I looked. 
Empirecapital	That no matter how much I take care of myself through working out on a daily basis and eating healthy I will never get the body I want. When I workout my body tightens and I have a pretty nice build, but the stubborn fat never goes away and after 5-6 months of seeing just very little results I stop working out to take a break and then within a week I'm back to how I was 5-6 months before. It's very depressing. 
Empirecapital	Read the book "Essentialism" it's made tailored to you! 
Empirecapital	Thank you for your reply! I am currently marketing in instagram @vecchiomedici and that's where all my sales come from. To be honest I don't know what other platforms to advertise on or how to do them. I did one on Facebook and it failed. I have had several repeat customers. One guy specifically lives in Beverly Hills and has ordered over 5 pairs in the last two months. I get orders from the EU a lot, California, Chicago, and a lot of other major cities. 
Empirecapital	Thank you, if it's OK with you. What else do you recommend be changed? From a customers point of view
Empirecapital	First off, thank you for your time. You put a lot of thought onto writing what you wrote and I appreciate that. I took much of your advice. I still do intend on changing some of the "about us" page. I changed the header to something more personal. I changed the "start designing" to "Custom platform", but instead of going straight to the platform it takes you to a "how it works/entering of the custom platform". The reason the custom platform didn't work for you may be one of two reasons either you didn't stay on the page as it loaded or you may be using an uncommon browser. If you can please try it out now I would truly appreciate your feedback. 
Empirecapital	Yes! How'd you know?
Empirecapital	I'm actually disappointed with kickstarter. I did one that I spent over a week on. It's currently live and I made a video and wrote a lot of  information, but I only recived a $4 donation...., which was immediately canceled. I'm surprised people scam on there. I never really thought of that. I received over 40 messages about people asking me to sign up for their crowd funding technique that will help me gain funds, but I feel like they're full of shit so I ignore them.
Empirecapital	Thank you brother : )
Empirecapital	Not only that. I know many unions that try to short change their members. It is absolutely disgusting. My father received a call from a lady (her brother and her are orphans so my dad takes care of them) and her husband got cancer and wanted his pension and the union basically said go fuck your self. A short lawyer note took care of that, but it shows how these people view workers as commodities that will hopefully die before they are given their pensions.  
Empirecapital	Definitely, I don't doubt it for a second. I'm Muslim, but I have studied the Christian religion well. I went to several churches especially during easter and the churches I went to did a lot of charity. The churches we rent out to are lower middle class. They're just bottom feeders trying to make a buck. And us Muslims are not innocent. I'm sure there are some corrupt ones out there. 
Empirecapital	There is a difference between that and siphoning your members for your own gain. The problem with the charity system is that it is not a clear difference, which allows a lot of room for corruption. 
Empirecapital	Pilots. I remember reading that they were the coolest most respected individuals in people's eyes. My father's friend once visited and he's a pilot. The lack of sleep he gets and his schedule combined with the lack of seeing his family for months at a time sounds like an absolute shit job. 
Empirecapital	Thank you, much much appreciated. It's been a tough 3 months, but when I hear these kind words it pushes me. We do have Chelsea too! You can find them on the custom platform mto.vecchiomedici.com 
Empirecapital	I'm sorry to have to disagree. Taxation then makes more sense, but church taxation now is just a scheme. My father has rented out to over 3 churches and it comes down to who is the most moving speaker who will get the most dollars. One of the priests called himself an apostle that speaks to God and man was it working, but every time we went to collect rent he was a complete hypocrite. He would curse, act like God himself, and was very pompous. Now it's all about who has the most members like an MLM scheme. And they are in it for the money. They want to spend spend spend. It's a competition. There was this scumbag priest who had over 300 pairs of shoes ,suits, hats and other unnecessary bullshit and that is all coming out of the pockets of naive believers. 
Empirecapital	I wouldn't be surprised. I test drove the Range and Land Rover and the Range felt much sturdier than the Land. It's as if the Land was Generic and that felt like anything can come off over a span of a few months
Empirecapital	I avoided buying a Range Rover from all the horror stories I've been hearing. Best of luck. It really is a beutiful car, but personally it's not worth the head  ache  
Empirecapital	Did you survive?
Empirecapital	My two baby bengal cats! | 
Empirecapital	"Right, like nobody on the internet has ever been rude for no reason. Fuck you." Bitch pleeassse...  
Empirecapital	Lmao! No flame war huh?
Empirecapital	Oh bless you. The reason I attacked you was for your racist and ignorant comment. The towel head bullshit. You'd think I'd be rude towards a nice guy with an honest job? 
Empirecapital	Trust me I'm very happy with the position in life I'm in right now. Some sacrifices are the ultimate reason for failure. Your job is supposed to compliment your life not be a substitute for it. Enjoy the bad weather : *
Empirecapital	Lmao, look at you trying to look like a hero for flying a commercial plane in which you spent the last two sentences complaining about. Have fun!
Empirecapital	How did you get started? 
Empirecapital	Thank you for your reply. It of curiosity how old are you now? And how's the life your living? Are you happy, sad, average? 
Empirecapital	That's what I find crazy. There the people who should be taken care of the most. They can make or break a company. 
Empirecapital	Is your father's friend American? If so, they really give you everything you need new car, house, private school for your kids, etc if you have an American degree and passport. 
Empirecapital	That's great to hear brother. I wish you the best. Books are the best way to mentally heal and progress. I'm an avid reader and just for the heck of it I'm going to suggest some books. They're more for the entrepreneur in all of us and they've  changed by life in different ways.   *Titan: An autobiography of John D. Rockefeller   *Made in America: an autobiography of Sam Walton (Guy that revolutionized a great industry) (created Wal-Mart)  *48 Laws of Power (very detailed book of pure power)  *The Wright Brother (by David McCullough) I just bought this book a 3 hours ago and I read the first chapter and I'm confident it'll be on the top of my list  They're extensively long books, but they're eye opening, motivating, and very fun to read! I'd start with 48 Laws of Power.
Empirecapital	Those are thee cutest ears!!!!!!
Empirecapital	Frozen...Not the cute Disney one, but the ski lift one. 
Empirecapital	When I said I read about pilots once being popular I lied....this movie is what I based my words on. 
Empirecapital	Lmao, I had an f3 marble bengal. The most beautiful cat I've ever had. He was thee craziest animal I have ever seen. He'd sleep in trees like an owl, you'd see animal parts all over the back yard, he would guard you when you left to put the trash out for pick up, etc. He was also very rough. I'd have scratches all over me every time we played. And don't get me started on the pee and poop....twas everywhere.... And he was very vocal too. 
Empirecapital	On this day in 1948 Israel declared independence. If this post was the discussion board to find a solution for both Israel & Palestine what would you have to say or add into the treaty? [Serious] | 
Empirecapital	Dinkleberrrgg!
Empirecapital	That's a great start! A two state solution? How would we go about it? What are guidelines that can be set for both sides and how can they be executed?
Empirecapital	Anytime! 
Empirecapital	Lol, it's funny you say that because I returned the girl (on the left) because she was stripping the boy of his personality. He was extremely scared of her and she controlled him like crazy. The second he realized we returned her he was pouncing around, sitting with me, purring etc.

Empirecapital	We do Blake construction and our leathers are vegetable tanned by the factory we use in Spain. Sorry for the late reply : )
Empirecapital	I'll be honest, I don't know much about the instep other than it be standard. As for the width, since our sites are fine from scratch, can be any width you would like. If we don't have the width in the checkout process you can email us and we can go ahead and do so. (EE, EEE, etc)
Stop_This_Pain	Stop fucking interrupting me. | Everyone fucking does it every time I'm with a group with someone. I once went to a pizza place with 4 people, expecting to have a good time. Everyone just chit-chatted among each other and laughed - everytime I tried to say something to add to conversation I was interrupted, till I almost yelled at them to pay attention to me. It happens every fucking time with everyone, whether on Discord servers, at my job, around my friends.  No one fucking pays attention to what I have to say. I played Cards Against Humanity with people at work. While it was my turn, people wouldn't even let me fucking start reading the black card, because they were cackling non-stop.  I was even called out for being loud when I speak. Well, what do you fucking expect, sunshine, when I'm the one being silenced?
Stop_This_Pain	I actually don't like sunny weather. Exercise bores me.   I'm lazy as in refusing to put effort in anything, whether it's my job, my life. I just do it as carelessly as possible. I swing by life. I play video games, watch Youtube, sometimes watch shows, sometimes talk with my friends, who don't give a shit about what I say and they're too busy over themselves.  I once went to pizza together with group of 4 people and they just chit-chatted among each other, ignoring me completely. I had to fucking yell at them to pay attention to me otherwise they were just interrupting me or straight up ignoring me.
Stop_This_Pain	Why?
Stop_This_Pain	I am the only one who can fix myself | And that thought is infuriating. Why can't be there some kind of brain surgery that fixes being lazy as shit all the time, so I can stop forcing myself to do work?  I just realized that everything is my responsibility. I have to be the one who must fix myself. There's no cure, surgery or any therapy that can make me feel better - it's always has to be me that has to force being motivated.  It makes me not try therapy at all. I'll probably have to keep a journal or some useless shit that I will forget about. I just wish there was some kind of happy pill that makes me super productive. Maybe then I'd finally be successful in live.  But alas, I'm a lazy piece of shit and I refuse to improve myself. Fuck it. I'd rather die than try anything.
Stop_This_Pain	I wish I was a kid again | I know some of the people here didn't have the greatest childhood, but still, for me those times were the happiest for me. Everything turned to shit when I've graduated high school. I wish I was that teenager again, being carefree and not worrying about earning money or my future.  I could have all the time in the world to enjoy. I could watch cartoons again, play video games and not give a fuck about anything. I miss walking home from school and listening to music. I miss my mom's dinners, having summer breaks, roleplaying with my friends.  Now everyone expects me to act like an adult and I hate it. Everyone says how they love being out of school, but they have a job that pays well, a degree and discipline to learn.  I'm like that pouting little kid, who refuses to live life and take responsibility. I feel like death is the only answer.
Stop_This_Pain	If it wasn't for pain, I'd do it. | I mean physical pain. I wouldn't mind leaving my family behind. I guess I'm a psychopath, but if there was some kind of procedure that eliminates pain completely, I'd do it.
Stop_This_Pain	How the fuck are drugs are going to help?
Stop_This_Pain	But I don't want to deal with pain on daily basis. If I'm gone, I wouldn't be hurting anymore. No more pain or bullshit like this.
Stop_This_Pain	If pain is temporary, how come so many people deal with depression for so many years?
Stop_This_Pain	It doesn't matter anyway, I don't really mind not falling for anyone - I dont see what's the big deal about it. I've been through one relationship and didn't work out. I'm actually happy for my ex, he found a guy who really loves him back.  But I don't care about anything, honestly. I don't know what I want from life, but video games, Reddit and YouTube videos are all that I do nowadays that does remotely interest me.
Stop_This_Pain	I've never really fallen in love, neither with a girl nor a guy. I thought I was gay, I had a long distance relationship with my ex for a year before I realized I didn't reprocate his feelings (even though I felt butterflies for quite a bit). Sometimes I wish I gave someone a chance, but I'm afraid of hurting anyone and to be fair, I'm scared to turn out straight - I already came out to my family and it would feel weird.  I cant really tell what I'm exactly working on due to company's policy, but I'm mostly doing mobile games and once in a while we have some titles that are yet to come out. I don't love games like I used to, but I still want to save up for a gaming PC.
Stop_This_Pain	You are probably going to feed me something like "tell your family and friends" or "do at least one productive thing per day".   I'm just a lazy fuck, who is not happy with his life but is too lazy to change it. I'm not intelligent or charming, I've been pissing my family off my whole life because of my clumsiness. Haven't picked up a book in a while, because basic concepts do not make sense to me (I dont even remember the names of all characters in GoT).  Basically I'm not intelligent or disciplined (I fucking hate that latter word, I associate it with being a slave) to do shit. I've failed college, because I refused to study and I hate learning. I haven't picked any uni yet for this year because I have no clue what I like and I refuse to pick anything for the sake of job prospects (IT bores the fuck out of me, I love video games but I do not understand how can you type numbers and commands for 8 hours straight).  I just said "fuck it" to everything. I hate everything, nothing brings me joy. The only time I'm calm is when I'm at work (I'm a QA tester).  I just gave up on everything and all I can think of is how nice would it be to jump off a balcony. But if I dont do it right, I might break my legs and be in enormous pain which I'm fucking paranoid of.
Stop_This_Pain	Everyone goes silent when I type anything on Discord or straight up ignore me. | Every time. I have to mention them using "@" to fucking get them to pay attention to me. I hate it, when they don't respond to me or cut me off.
Stop_This_Pain	I dont take drugs because in the end, it's just an escape. They will make me happy for a while and then I'm back to square one.  It's better to just kill myself and be done with it.
Stop_This_Pain	Why do I have to be the one to fix myself? | I wish there was some kind of drug instead of all this self improvement bull crap that takes years where you have to push yourself to be happy.  Why cant no one take responsibility for me this one time?
Stop_This_Pain	The world is unfair | So why should I bother living, if some people are gonna take away my happiness?  I wish there was no poverty or sadness. Equal chance for everyone would be the best. But it is impossible and I hate that it is.  Too much negativity is on this world and no, it's not some bullshit illness clouding my mind. Everyone strives for happiness for a reason.   I'm starting to think depression is a way of reality to opening our eyes. We think the world is okay, but how can it be okay if we feel this way?
Stop_This_Pain	Its all about faking everything. | Fake smiling. Fake enjoying your work. Fake that you love to study all the shit. Fake, fake fake fake fake fake fake, effort effort effort work work work work work work.  hahhaha  I wish i coukd be fucking carefree as all of you you lucky bastards  i feel like smashing my fucking laptop on the wall and screaming   why does eveyrything need to tkae effort  why are you all agreeing to this  why can't we just die easily and be done with all that jazz?
Stop_This_Pain	I have rich parents, but I'm on my own and I'm too proud and independent to ask them anything. They clearly love me and would do anything for me, but they can't fix my issues that I'm not willing to fix myself.  I'm sorry that you feel that way. I've never honestly bothered with the relationship thing, because I'm too selfish.
Stop_This_Pain	I am myself every day. Every day I go to work. Every day I talk with people. I smile, I'm okay. I visit my family, I'm okay. I'm home alone, I'm left with fucking demons that are fucking me in the head or I think I do I don't even fuckin gknow if I have depression or not. It's just work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work.
Stop_This_Pain	You are alive, stop kidding yourself. You are the same you from the past, just richer. Your brother was just lucky to stumble upon you.  Maybe you just went into shock after that dose of heroine and coma left a big mark on your psyche.  It doesn't matter anyway, you're still alive and breathing. That's it. Nothing more into it.
Stop_This_Pain	I wish I could switch places with depressed rich people | At least not worrying about making through the month and spending cash on anything I want would be less to worry about.  I keep buying lottery tickets. How naive of me.
Stop_This_Pain	Is being too lazy a valid reason for suicide? | I have no plan on going to college (I've gone to one abroad, but I didn't study at all and soon I dropped out) or doing a trade, I have no energy except for going to work and coming home to lay in bed all day and watching shows on my laptop. I have no ambitions, no desire to do any hobbies - basically I hate learning anything, I find reading boring, listening to educational talks boring, doing complex shit boring and too hard. Everything is just fucking boring or requires effort.  I think I'm pampered and I keep whining about my "problems" on the Internet, because I can't be bothered to move my arse to fix anything.   Before you ask - no, I don't want to make video games (programming is stupid and boring anyway) and no, I don't like anything in particular (I used to like video games, but now I'm too lazy to play them. I buy one every once in a while, but it doesn't take long for me to get bored.)  I'm just a nobody. I have nothing to work towards, I'm dumb to grasp basic concepts like taxes (and have no desire to learn about it.) or my laws. I don't even fucking know who my politicians are.  And yes, I'm writing this out of attention, since I'm powerless to do something about it.
Stop_This_Pain	I don't think I have anything to work towards. I appreciate the sentiment, but nothing works on me so far.
Stop_This_Pain	It's expensive as hell though.
Stop_This_Pain	I just said I don't like doing anything. And I mentioned having a job.
Stop_This_Pain	Who knows. Maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I'd be able to live life carefree.
Stop_This_Pain	Haha, I wish I was earning as much as you to be able to buy a motorcycle. Half of my paycheck goes on rent itself.
Stop_This_Pain	Still it's a chance. Pizza will not bring me happiness. Money could. At least I'd be able to repay what I owe to student finance and my family. Maybe I'd be able to go to college and switch major without worrying about wasting money just because I didn't like what I studied (although I think I hate studying in general.)
Stop_This_Pain	Wish there was a way to turn off pain receptors. | Let's be real here. Majority of suicides do not work, because we're scared of physical suffering. Cutting yourself open would cause an unbelievable agony.  Imagine if there was a way not to feel pain when you get injured, maimed or something. Death would be much, much easier.
Stop_This_Pain	"If not for yourself, live for others" | Why the fuck would I care about anyone else if I can't take care of myself? I don't fucking care if someone else is in pain or will be in pain after I'm gone. I couldn't give a shit if someone cried at my grave or spit at my body.  Maybe I'm just a psychopath unable to return love to anyone, even my family who cared about me all the time. Yet I still feel little remorse about leaving them behind, even though I know it will fuck them up.  If I do it, I won't be able to feel anything. No guilt, no remorse, nothing, nada. I will leave this life behind. If only there was a physically painless way to do it, but no, those fucking pain nerves that will fuck everything up must kick in.
Stop_This_Pain	What's the point. After the trip is done, I'm still hurting and my problems won't go away. Cigs, alcohol and drugs won't help me.
Stop_This_Pain	If I was 100% sure that I'd die without any pain whatsoever, I'd take it anyway. I don't care for this existential crap, it's only in my head.
Stop_This_Pain	Not really, I'm not familiar with any substances at all. My friend tried LSD, but said the hallucinations scared the fuck out of him.
Stop_This_Pain	And of course, everything goes silent as usual. Nobody gives a fuck as always.
Stop_This_Pain	Because life is a constant struggle, I'm lazy with no willingness to improve my life in any way. I'm dumb as rocks, couldn't even get past first year of college before I dropped out. I have no ambitions, everything is boring or requires too much effort. I do not have any talents or willingness to learn skills.  I'm just a waste of space that can only whine whine whine because that's the only coping method that allows me not to go completely insane.

Stop_This_Pain	Why? What is so fun about being alive? 
Stop_This_Pain	You don't. You are still alive. How would you know?
Stop_This_Pain	Coping mechanisms | What a load of garbage. It just proves the point that some issues are not fixable in any way. I refuse to act like nothing is wrong or fight it without hope of getting better. If that's what life looks like, I'd rather die then
Stop_This_Pain	I've wanted to try anal masturbation, but it doesn't feel good for me with my fingers. Any idea for making the experience better?
Stop_This_Pain	Blade Runner.
Stop_This_Pain	Actually better, I think. Used to whine about stuff on Reddit and thought I was depressed and suicidal -but in fact I realized that I was just attention seeking.
Stop_This_Pain	Haha, when I lived at my parents with my sister, they were constantly borrowing from me because I was the one saving up in an emergency and I didn't have many expenses at the time. Even now I try not to overspend (although it is hard, too much money goes on snacks at work). I'm currently trying to save up for a gaming PC, but that may take a long time, given the expenses
Stop_This_Pain	Let's say you came chocolate - would you still taste it?
Stop_This_Pain	I hope you find bliss one day. But why the photo?
Stop_This_Pain	I thought about that - like I mentioned, I didn't have any crushes nor was I interested in anyone in that way. I've always treated my friends as friends and I do not step beyond that, cause I don't need to.  But I have a high libido, which I try to satiate with porn or erotic role plays (I know, weird). If anything I thought of myself as an aromantic sexual, but I'm not familiar with the topic.  I want to be able to find that someone, with whom I will be more than just friends.
Stop_This_Pain	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of God, whether he exists or not.
Stop_This_Pain	I wish I had your life instead.
Stop_This_Pain	It's hard to imagine, when you've lived your whole life playing and browsing Internet since you were young. So it's hard to answer. I imagine it must've been simpler times.
Stop_This_Pain	Tomorrow colleges all over my country will be recruiting. And I have no idea what course do I want. I have a job as a game tester, which honestly doesn't even pay for studio flat (I had to rent a room - I mean it's obviously cheaper, but I can't be expected to live the rest of my life in a room, do I?), but I have absolutely no desire to improve my life.   I'm waiting for a miracle to change my life, because I'm unmotivated to be the change and I don't plan ahead. I'm living in the moment. I'm not intelligent or smart enough to study anything, every book confuses me or is boring to me.  I'm waiting for someone to shoot me in the head. Bam. One pull of the trigger and before I know it, it's all over. That's ideal. Painless, just cut to black. No more worrying about shit, I won't have to worry about ruining my family. Better to amputate the infected leg before it grows bigger. They'll cry, I know that. But eventually, they will have to move on and feel relief, that a parasite like me won't have to borrow money from them and hurt them anymore.  Maybe I'm selfish, but I want a quick death - I don't want pain. Despite all I'm saying, I don't want to feel pain.  If only guns were legal.
Stop_This_Pain	Calling it a skill is like treating nose-picking as a skill. Sometimes I'm too lazy to play and I just watch shit on YouTube instead or browse furry porn, because that is the only thing that remotely arouses me. 
Stop_This_Pain	Do your parents try to convince you to move out or try to change your life?
Stop_This_Pain	The interview was quite simple - they asked us what type of games do we usually play and they gave us a paper with the screenshot from random games on it asking us to describe what was the game like based only from that screenshot. The interview was semi-formal - they didn't make us wear a suit and a tie. The test was basically a few hours checking the random game for bugs and errors and trying to list as many as possible.  Although it may differ from company to company, so I can't say how would it look like if you applied. Just wear something smart if you get the chance - you may find that the majority of people just dont give a shit what they wear (like at my workplace) or they may require of you to be formal. Try to notice what employees look like.  Good luck out there.
Stop_This_Pain	You're welcome. If you have any further questions, I'm happy to answer.
Stop_This_Pain	I don't know what policy other companies have, but in my case I had a training/test before I was employed, so yeah, something like you said.  I wish you good luck with overcoming your anxiety one day.
Stop_This_Pain	At least you have a degree and worked towards it. I can't be bothered to even look on the university offers, because everything seems bland or boring. Engineering is definitely hard, I don't understand how do people stand stressing out over the books and 3000 word essays for all these years.
Stop_This_Pain	Fuck responsibility then. I can't do this on my own. Everything is going to shit anyway, every year it's getting worse and worse around the world. Someday it's all going to collapse.  I'd end it, if I found a painless way to do it. It's better than being unhappy for the rest of my life, because I can't change shit. The world is not going to change for me and I'm not going to change for the world.
Stop_This_Pain	I guess I felt related in some way. Plus, venting out kinda helps me to cope with my situation is some way.
Stop_This_Pain	See, that's the problem. I always thought of life as carefree as I could - my mentality was always like "it's gonna be fine, it's all gonna be figured out by itself". And now I see all those college graduates applying for jobs, Masters, PhDs and other useless shit. Everyone is competing with everyone, the employers just sit back and watch us fight and cry over a fucking desk inside a cubicle.  I'm a simple mind. I don't know how people cope with this.
Stop_This_Pain	I'm not interested in competitive gaming - as much as I like games, I use them to relax and get away from the real world. I often just watch walkthroughs, if I can't afford games or my hardware is too poor to run it. If it's multiplayer, I may play it for a long while, but no more than 30 hours. The only exception is Rocket League, but recently I took a break from it ever since I dropped out from university back to my parents.  A blog sounds interesting, but I have no idea what would it be about. I used to write, but that was back in primary school, when I was truly carefree and innocent and didn't give a shit about anything. Plus knowing myself, I'd drop it after a while - like I said, nothing interests me long enough to pursue.  As much as I want to share your point of view with money, it is necessary to survive and at least afford hobbies. My biggest dream once was to build a gaming rig, but that was back when getting a job didn't cross my mind - my family wanted me  to go to therapy (due to my spinal pain) all summer and I didn't question it. I was just doing what I was told, my fault. Now that I got a job, I'm an adult and no longer in school, so now I have to move out somewhere and spend the majority of my paycheck on rent and food. I can't develop hobbies like this.  I wish I could stay a kid forever and never have responsibilities. But the time flies against my will and soon I may end up somewhere really dark, if I keep going on like this. I just wish I had some faint idea or someone to guide me, tell me what to do. I don't know myself, I always relied on everyone else to make decisions for me and now that I have to choose for myself, I'm in deep shit.  It's always been like this - a human's worth is measured by his contribution to society and how he provides for his family. I never want to have kids, I don't even care about having a girlfriend/boyfriend (although the latter would be nice to have, honestly). And what do I contribute? Absolutely nothing.
Stop_This_Pain	No skills. | From what I see, the majority of NEETs here either have college degrees or make YouTube videos or at least have some faint interest in something other than gaming. That's more productive than I'd ever be.  All I do is just playing video games, because I hate learning anything new. I have no interest in coding, finding about finance or something like that. I never had the desire to learn anything new - all I browse on the internet is memes and YouTube gaming videos.  I wanted to give YouTube a try, but after seeing how much effort it requires, I gave up in 5 minutes and never touched video making programs since then. Basically if it requires effort to read up on something, I'm unmotivated and I refuse to do shit.  I have a job, a game tester but I often feel incompetent since I can go hours without reporting any bugs or doing checklists unlike my colleagues who are constantly busy with work and talk with each other about issues they discovered for hours even.  I think I may not be suitable for life, if I'm that bad at everything and refuse to improve. Death might be the only way out of this shit, but I'm too pussy to do it.
Stop_This_Pain	[Tough Love] I don't give a shit about my life anymore and I don't care if I hurt anyone with my suicide. | [Conflicted]  Everyone is so fucking selfish and so am I. I love nothing more than myself - I am a lazy piece of shit who would rather spend time playing video games all day instead of finding a job and studying - I have no real skills. The moment I get cut off from Internet, it's the moment I go to the shooting range, put a gun in my mouth and press the trigger as many times as possible.  I don't fucking care about anyone but myself, I've never loved anyone, not even my parents as much as I tried and as much as they have given me so much. I can't repay anything back because I'm just a burden, a joke, a black sheep who is talked about on family meetings when someone misbehaves ("Careful, you do not want to end up like Stop_This_Pain, don't you? Now study and work hard.)  The best part is I don't want to change myself - I'm comfortable with being a lazy piece of crap. The only time I leave the house is when my dad comes home, so he doesn't talk with me about my future and how I wasted all the money on my silly fantasies and college abroad (which I obviously failed.)  If only I had the courage to take some immense pain for a brief moment. I don't want to spend a majority of time waiting to die in agony - it scares the fuck out of me.  No one can help anymore, I can only help myself and I don't want to help myself, cause in my mind I'm doing nothing wrong. I'm comfortable where I am, but it's not a way to live in modern society.  I've bought a lotto ticket yesterday, because I'm so fucking gullible that I could win this shit, repay my debt, repay what I owe to my family and maybe, maybe think about my future (or spend the rest of my life basking in cash only to end up poor again and truly hopeless, after I spend everything.)  I am a selfish piece of shit and I deserve to be killed. Hell, maybe my dad will stop putting up with me and finally throw me off the balcony one day. He'd be doing my family a great relief.  I have nowhere else to turn to, except a cashing job for the rest of my fucking life in a shit country with politicians stupid as shit (yet I don't give a fuck about politics, I don't even know who the major politicians are.)  I want to die so badly. 
Stop_This_Pain	I want to believe that the future is going to be okay, but I need to change and I cannot do that - hence I'm going downhill and the worst part is I'm comfortable with that, hence I don't see the reason to suddenly turn my life over.  I could always get a job at some supermarket, but if that's what I'm supposed to do for the rest of my life, then I'd rather check out  early. I have no obligations, I dont want a relationship (I'm too selfish to love anyone and I don't like spending money) and in the long run, it's gonna be a better decision. I am not going to stay long enough to be a murmured about with contempt on family meetings.  There are homeless people all over and I'm about to join one of them - if that happens, I'm not staying long enough to freeze or starve to death or to be spit on for many years to come.
Stop_This_Pain	I am about to be 21 years old. It's about time I grew up, but I can't.
Shadothefato	I hadn't thought about it like this.  I just hope she can see that I just wanted her to be okay
Shadothefato	After this, I know she won't want to talk to me.  I really messed up this time. 
Shadothefato	Worst part is I don't think I'll ever find out what happened exactly because she promised to never talk to me again.  I agree that going to meet an unknown guy while drunk was a bad decision but I feel like it's also my fault for not stopping her.  She doesn't like to listen to other people so I doubt I could've even if I tried harder. 
Shadothefato	I'm sorry, my brain is trying to play catch up.  Nothing ended up happening, they were meeting up I guess to hook up and she knew him from tinder or something and I was the person she trusted to check in on her and call the cops if she was gone too long.    She was high and underage drinking when the cops showed up to her house I guess.  She called me and let me know that her life was over now so I can only assume that she got in trouble because of me.  My life is over in the sense that I just can't handle knowing that I did this to her.  I honestly thought that I was helping her.   I'll try to fix the post a little.  
Shadothefato	I just lost my last friend because I thought I was helping. | This all happened a few hours ago and I really don't know what to do.  I messed up really bad.    My friend was a little high and decided to meet a guy at a church near her house so she had me on the phone to call the cops if anything went wrong.  She already told me she didn't trust the guy.  She told me if she doesn't call me in 30 minutes to call the police, I gave her 50 minutes because I figured her phone may have died but I was worried about her and called anyway.  She eventually did call me to let me know she was okay so I called the police station back and told them the same.  Well they ended up going to her house anyway to check on her.  I guess the police found her high and drinking underage. I can only assume she's in a ton a trouble all because of me.   She called me around fifteen minutes ago to tell me that her life was over and she was never going to talk to me again.  I've never been in a situation like this and I don't think I can live with ruining someone's life like this.  I thought I was helping.    I tried talking to the suicide prevention hotline a few minutes ago and he put me on hold multiple times and just told me it was her fault but I know it's not all on her.  I feel so helpless now.  How do you recover from knowing you ruined someone's life?  I just ruined my own life too.  I wish I had just slept through her phone calls tonight.  Somebody please help me because this seems like the type of thing that I'll never be able to get over.  
Shadothefato	That stupid Arkham Knight trophy where you have to hit 14 different special moves in a row without getting hit.  I also collected all the riddler trophies in that game.  Maybe Mile High Club in Modern Warfare?  Neither are super hard but they're really time consuming. 
Shadothefato	I took Wellbutrin alone for a couple months last year.  Not sure if it's connected but last year was also one of my worst years when it comes to anxiety and depression.  I never felt any different after taking it but I do think it helped me with my bad eating habits but that could just be a placebo.    
Shadothefato	Hours away from losing my dog | For the last two years, my family has been in the middle of a financial crisis.  We haven't been able to afford rent in 8 months and our landlord has tried to give us time to find a new place but he's gotten tired of it and we're moving out in the morning.  We're falling apart slowly.  Just last month we lost the car because we couldn't afford payments anymore.    In around 6 hours I'll be leaving my house to move in with my mom and sleep on her couch.  My grandma, who I live with, will be moving into her mother's house.  Now my Great Grandmother already offered the house to my grandma and our dog but unfortunately she doesn't remember doing so.  In the meantime, my aunt has been making the decisions for her and decided she doesn't want my dog to come up to the house because she worries the dog will tear something up.  I have offered each and every compromise I could imagine (a fence, paying rent, pet deposit, etc.) she just will not budge.  So in a few hours I'll be taking my dog to a no-kill animal shelter and putting her up for adoption.  She's got severe separation anxiety and I've nearly lost her twice before.  My grandma and I both have grown really attached to this dog but we're out of options.  We have no one to take care of the dog and we need to stay somewhere rent free so we can save up some money.  I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I can't even look at my dog because in a few hours I'll be abandoning her.  I just can't see getting over this and I try to think of the future so I don't think about the present.  I see no future.    I don't know if this kind of thing is allowed but I just needed to vent because my friends either can't do anything about it or won't talk to me long enough to cheer me up.  Of course I'm open to any and all advice.  I can't lose this dog, it'll kill me and my grandmother both.   
Shadothefato	There's definitely nothing wrong with enjoying venting out to other people.  Sounds to me that you're worried people will think you're being too needy or selfish by wanting to vent.  The whole point of talking about these things is to help you feel better and get some weight off your shoulders.  Don't feel bad just be sure to let your friend vent if they want to.  I hope things work out for you   Edit: I'm also pretty bad about trying to keep people happy to avoid confrontation.  It's totally normal and probably is just your anxiety.  Sometimes it's hard to remember that it's important to express your feelings and opinions to others even if they don't necessarily agree with you.  Also maybe try to get a therapist or find someone you can talk to on a more personal level.  Or at least write your feelings down because sometimes my head will just start spinning and I can't focus but writing it out and having a list of things I'm feeling tends to help me stay grounded.  A 30 minute walk can do wonders but I imagine it's not easy when you're feeling fatigue.  Make sure to drink lots of water and add some fruit to you diet if you haven't already.  Get a normal sleep schedule and stick to it.  Hopefully some of this will help. 
Shadothefato	Yeah I guess I didn't really think about that when I was typing this out 
Shadothefato	5th grade school dance.  After my friends convinced me (a fat guy) to walk up to my crush, ask her out and then get rejected in front of at least 20 kids, one of my other female friends walked up to me and asked me to dance with her.  Not being able to dance and not wanting to experience anymore embarrassment, I ran across the gym and into the bathroom.  The next day the guidance councilor found me and told me how messed up it was to run away from the girl who just wanted to make me feel better after getting embarrassed.  I still cringe to this day and I'm 18.  That wasn't the first or the last time I embarrassed myself in front of a girl in public..
Shadothefato	Thank you.  Definitely going to be looking into it
Shadothefato	I was looking for subreddits like this but didn't know exactly what to be looking for.  Thank you for being so helpful.  
Shadothefato	Thank you so much.  
Shadothefato	I'm 18 years old
Shadothefato	So helpful.  Thank you so much. 
Shadothefato	Currently trying to see if my grandma can stay at her mom's place for a few months.  Going by later to find out about the car.  Honestly my head has been running nonstop for the last few weeks and I couldn't even focus enough to decide what to do.  Having someone pointing me in the right direction is going to make a huge difference so thank you very much for the help.
Shadothefato	Yeah my friends and I are working on finding a CPU and Motherboard that I can use until I can get the money for a better upgrade.  Thank you 
Shadothefato	Is my fps normal for my PC? | So I don't really know much when it comes to PC (I'm learning) but I do know that I've been getting around 60-70 fps on low and then occasionally dropping down to 20-30 when playing Overwatch.  It's not even like a slow drop, it'll just cut straight down making it impossible to play in those situations.  I had to run Cod on low during a free weekend but was able to run Battlefront on medium-high.  Can someone tell me whether it's my build or maybe something else that's causing these drops?  Processor - AMD Athlon x4 860K 3.7GHz (Quad Core)  Motherboard - Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H (is that how I write that out?) Memory - 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600MHz   Hard Drive - 2TB 7200 RPM Graphics Card - Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 2GB Power Supply - 500 Watts  Anyway, I'm not far enough into my PC career to know what's great and what's just average so I need a little guidance.  Thank you. 
Shadothefato	I'll check when I get home.  Thanks for the help
Shadothefato	Thank you so much.  Going to get started looking for an FM2+ cpu for now.  Any suggestions?
Shadothefato	Getting really bad fps on low?! | So I don't really know much when it comes to PC (I'm learning) but I do know that I've been getting around 60-70 fps on low and then occasionally dropping down to 20-30.

modgill	Mojo is now modjo | This band used to be mojo with the song Lady hear me tonight.  Now they are called modjo. Wtf  I really would have noticed this before but no. It was mojo. Wtf is going on
modgill	Been feeling EMPTY inside for 10+ years and Depressed | Well, i want to start out with brief about what all happened to me and i kinda feel like shit ever since 2008. When a triple-tragedy struck me. I have never spoken about any of this to anyone, let alone the internet. this is my deep feelings and thoughts who i wanted to share with someone who can come up with answers   before 2008, I was a really happy, crazy and adventurous person. And i studied in england from 1999 to 2005. After that period i came back to my home country and met an amazing women in 2006 and we instantly fell over each other. Everything was going great between me, her and everything was exception in my life, like my business, my adventures and excursions and everything i could ever ask for. I smoked, drank, partied and above all, went to long nature trips in mountains and hills.    I don't know how it started but my women & me started having a few problems over getting married. She was insisting on quick marriage, and i wanted more time thinking we were still young and everything fell apart and fights happened. Then i found out few weeks later that she was sleeping with someone else and i legit felt suicidal and even tried to twice. ( this was 2007-late) i kept crying man-tears for 6 months, had panic and anxiety attacks at night and i was literally losing 5-10 KG weight between that period.    And then in 2008-mid, triple tragedy struck. First my girl, outright confessed to me, that she was with someone else and dumped me, and married someone else abroad and met me one last time before going out to another country saying me final goodbye. a few days later, my dad died under mysterious circumstances, with some saying he committed suicide and some thinking he had brain hemorrhage. A couple of days, after he passed away. the Banks came over to my company, took over all the assets and sold it to another company and gave me literally peanuts. And it was all hell which broke loose during that month. I had been reduced from living like a king to a roadside homeless beggar. almost overnight.   Within 6 months, i started my new company from scratch paid off my father's pending loans, creditors and taxmen (which would continue to be paid off even 5 years later). I ultimately got married and have a son now. and after that i came to know that my mother had a secret affair with one of the worst humans i know even during the time when my father was alive. I confronted her and she didnt give me a straight answer. Few months later, she took all the money, property papers etc and fled to this monster of a man. I confronted her again and ultimately she wanted me & my wife/son out of the house. Eventually we had to move out and i was thrown out of her inheritance and strangely my sisters also accepted my mother's decision and stayed with her and sided with her. they took almost 90% of my money (which i foolishy gave them and trusted them)  Ever Since then, my life has been close to hell. My wife thinks she had bad luck that she got married to me and face all these problems which other women don't and it had made her infuriated against me even for a small issue, to which i cant say a word anymore. i couldn't and cannot fully concentrate on my work, even though work is going OKish. I am surrounded 24/7 by nostalgia of how my life had been and how it just slipped right out of my hands despite my best fucking efforts. I used to be so driven and willing to take risks. But now im a shadow of my own self, withering in pain silently, not able to say anything back to anyone and just accepting how things are. I work silently and still give in my best thought and best efforts.   Literally almost all family connection i had is now a faded memory, the person i loved a most and who loved me the most was my dad. Everyone else is estranged now. Anyone else in my position at any given point between these last 10 years, would outright commit suicide. But i have stood upright and taken in all wrong and right criticism thrown at me and i have literally taken everything on the chin. I think its wrong that i am alive and i feel EMPTY inside. No emotions, just a long dull pain. What i have gone through, i cannot even imagine anyone else being in that position and living through it. I literally was a millionaire and then became peniless , millionaire again and now again just passing through time.   Even though i dont have money problems even now. Everything else just feels COLD. Emotionless, like a gulp in the wind. I literally had a heartbreak with my own life, which i loved so much and now whatever i try, i'm just clutching at straws. I even tried smoking weed once or twice a month and i must say, it gives me a clear vision for that month and makes me bit more calm.   Every single thing is telling me to end this life and i still foolishly carry on..... I don't know why im built like rock to withstand all the bullshit i have had to face so far.   Please tell me what to do.......
modgill	Another thing is facing all this in life has made me very emotionless. alot of times, i am told off that i am insensitive. Which i feel i have become so due to whatever i have had to face. Being a Middle-class person after being Filthy rich at one point of life is really difficult to chew on. I was never egoistic about money and all . but it does affect even the best of us. I studied psychology too around 12 years back. And maybe thats why i am alive today (never thought about this aspect before).   I am very level headed and even in the worst of times, i am calculative and think everything in a calm manner.   I am surviving but i do not like this ONE BIT. i thought it would get better over the last 6-7 years, but things are NOT improving and i donot see it improving down the line. and i also know that being a thick rock , i wont do anything stupid either.   Its like im stuck between a rock and a hard place. Fuck me life. 
modgill	Well the hardest thing now is Nostalgia but even harder is the constant chatter of my wife. Even though we are now away and out of my mother's and sisters life in every inch possible way. My wife never forgets to rub it in .   Shez constantly telling me how my mum and sisters are sluts (which they might well be) and i am born of their blood. And this happens at every silly mistake or whatever. I don't utter a single word in response. As my mum n sisters did try to make my wife's life a living hell. so there is a deep underlying grudge she has. But even thought we have been kicked out of the house and my mum/sis have betrayed me, hearing bad words about them, just disturbs me deeply. I just dont want to hear anything about them. But my wife never spare a single day.   Sometimes it gets to the point that, i almost kill myself but i calm myself cuz of my love for what i have left, my son & my wife. My wife supported me through the trouble but she has big time anger issues. Says something deeply troubling for 2 hours and next day says sorry how her words might have hurt me. and i just say OKAY. when in reality i have been contemplating suicide the whole previous night.   I have been betrayed by a lot of people in my life. My mother, my two sisters, my uncle, my two best friends etc. I have stood this test which god has given to me. I don;t know if hez testing my limits. Also i m abused my wife many times in a week, on the same pretext of Being an insider of my mom and being her blood and what not. Its just very unhealthy and i cry a lot when i am alone and i cry without any sound cuz my wife might hear it.   Its just a complex situation im in right now. Actually my wife told me not to trust my mom and sisters with Money, before they threw us out. i didn't listen to my wife back then. or only partially listened to her. and now she blames me for having less money then what we have right now. 
modgill	r/Tress33  I know you are a gamer like me. and even i have similar problems about life right now. and also thinking of a way of making it look like an accident.   But 1 thing just hit me, what if we can get a Playstation 4, and some money. Run away to a far away place. Play our best games and take it from there?   I know for a damn fact that people around us make us feel miserable and bills compound that shit. Just run away. stay somewhere else and try to find a new life, instead of ending it. 
modgill	I got vedanta shares and also preference shares.  Both credited into my demat long back. Maybe like 3 months back.  From there. Already appreciated more then 25%  
modgill	Vedanta preference shares | Hi guys.  I used to hold cairn India stock. Now vedanta took over. And I received 612 preference shares of vedanta at 7.5% or whatever.   Now its price was 10 at the start. I can't trade it but it's in my account. Price yesterday was 10.20  So if I can't trade it what's moving the price? What is the benefit of holding this? I'm holding onto 50k worth shares of vedanta and it has got good gains till now. 
modgill	Good option actually
modgill	Can't help but think this is really lame.   They should stop the reshashing and think about season 2
modgill	Wtf hahhahha
modgill	First 1500 chest I got. I unlocked asav for me
modgill	They keep deleting bad shares from Sensex and keep adding trending shares into Sensex and nifty both.   The end result is that Sensex and nifty don't seem to be going down.   Earlier the additions and subtractions from Sensex n nifty were very less. Now it's very frequent.   Look at IT and Pharma. Two of the biggest sectors crashed this year.   Lot of mid cap and small cap companies are down 20-30% but they were deleted from midcap index.   The fall is happening but it's not reflected in Sensex or nifty 
modgill	Searching for TDM right now, it's been 15minutes | I don't know what's happened in last 4 days. But I havnt been able to find matches easily at all.   For a TDM game, as I speak I'm in matchmaking for last 15minutes or more.   It doesn't matter if I'm solo or playing in an American party or European. Finding matches is becoming unbearable. 
modgill	And this just happened last night for me. around 24 hours back I noticed this while driving and saw a billboard. I came on retconned last night too but didn't see a thread here about it. Thought about making one thread but got busy playing multiplayer games.   Damn. This is weird as fuck for me. Because of thought about bizzare just last night. 
modgill	This is the freakiest thing I have seen today, just yesterday I saw a commercial board where bizarre was written and I thought, Hmmm, never seen that word before.   I come here today with someone mentioning the exact same ME. This is like coincidence of huge proportion for me.   For me it was always bizzare. 
modgill	Tried solo also. Found a match after 16 minutes. 
modgill	Probably the biggest pile of bullshit ever heard. 
modgill	Even I can't find a match in long time.   It seems naughty dog has fucked up the servers again 
modgill	DLC weapon that's why
modgill	So 850 now. Wat has as it falls even further. Funds r exiting in a big way. Boardroom battle will continue and hammer the price further down 
modgill	That is awesome actually.   
modgill	No, no and surely NO
modgill	Its all about sentiment. And right now it's very bad. Funds will exit thinking something is cooking.   That exit will push down its price. When they start falling, no one can predict the bottom.   When lloyd electric sold its brand name for 1500 crore and deal was excellent. I exited at 290. I knew sentiment is bad. Now it's 170 and still falling despite good numbers.   
modgill	The drop is huge. Infy is headed for 600. Exit now and enter later. At least reduce holdings
modgill	That's an average these days. I have had months on end where I smoked 1 or 2 a day. In 20s and teens.   But no addiction, no withdrawal. 
modgill	Chemicals are what it is. Side effects and harmful chems inside ur system. Meth and E fuck up body system is a huge way. I don't understand how u fail to see that. 
modgill	Not really. Been smoking since 20 years. That too on average once a month. Not an addiction. Withdrawal and addiction with hash or weed doesn't exist.   I'm talking from experience and around people who used it. Whatever studies say is bullshit
modgill	Yeah I'm happy being a herbal noob since 20 years. While the new kids won't keep short on anything that wrongly fuck their own body. 
modgill	For me. It.   I wrote this from my mind and what I remember.   
modgill	Hard drugs fuck up your body system. Herb doesn't. And that's the crucial difference 
modgill	Something is better then nothing. Zero weapons and zero maps. That is absolutely laughable.   No man's sky is compromised of 3 people. And your point is? 
modgill	i cannot understand why do people do hard drugs when something as simple as HERB is safe and secure.   I have been to curlies few times and it was an awesome place. we had our own stash, but i didnt see any waiters or people around selling stuff. Even if we asked, people said, buy your own from outside and bring it. and it had bouncers too, which checked everything you had on you. This was around 4 years back. dunno what changed since then.   And those people who ODed , probably did on some heavy stuff. Slowly the scene around these hippy places will die and forgotten for 5-10 years.   And it will eventually return again, like it always does. everything is a circle.   
modgill	I have a feeling that lost legacy will be just bullshit single player. Just like uncharted 4 was. I actually enjoy uc4 mp so much more then single player.   It was such a boring game seriously. Compared to u3 and u2. Uc4 is a fucking nightmare. 
modgill	Are they coming up. With another livestream or that was it?   They didnt show anything by looks of it.   No maps No weapons   Are they serious? 
modgill	Now overstaying his welcome. Fuck off Dhoni 
modgill	The only reason marijuana is not legal and all this hype around it is. because of Ciggs & Alcohal.   Both of them are huge industries and huge companies run the governments and banks. They would hate a natural, cheap and no side-effects (None proven) competitor. Which if legalised and promoted, can blow away any competition.   When i smoke a J, i usually dont smoke ciggs for a week. And to be honest, i havn't had a single Drink of alcohal (any kinds) since two months. and i only smoke 1 or 2 joints a month. 
modgill	Since 1st August, My portfolio is down 8.7%.   And thats a huge drop. out of 8.7% today, it was 4.9% total portfolio drop.   But the sensex has not dropped that much. I sense the correction is here, and here to stay for at least 10-15 days.   I think, sensex will go down till 29k. and midcaps and smallcaps will bleed more. Where i hold the maximum stake.   im never worried though, more correction is very healthy, as i was also panicking that correction is not coming. oh well, its here now. 
modgill	Actually i use the Krivosk a lot, and a lot of times, i can down people in 2 shots. But sometimes the shots just wobble too much and hitting headshots also dont register sometimes, which is probably due to lag.   Its weird, but i think, the LP shots shouldn't be increased. A lot of freinds, who are great at UC4, when they use krivosk for challenges and even for longer period, can't get around to use the gun much.   And surprisingly, it will used very less in Multiplayer. i rarely, i mean even less then Shotgun and Bishai. that people use it. 
modgill	Even i noticed this last night and screenshotted it.   Also detail is that, even in 300 DLC Vanity Chest, the same picture of Nadine, Chloe & Asav was also showing. Which again went back to old placeholder after 3-4 minutes.   But the main, Lost Legacy Bundle Kept showing. If you clicked on it, the old bundles popped up and you couldn't view the bundle itself, and it wasn't even in the list. 
modgill	I can tell you top 5 and i have unlocked all mods for them.   1) Agarwal 2) Krivosk 3) Enforcer 4) Micro 9MM 5) Raffica 
modgill	Yes it's reaching dangerous levels now. At 28 I think that's the peak. Unless the earnings improves and keeps the ratio at 25 and thereabouts, the nifty can correct 20% anytime.   But the event which can correct the nifty will be global event. And not an isolated event in India.   
modgill	Hahaha super
modgill	Be careful. Even debt funds crash like it did in 2012 and 2013 early. When markets crash, nothing is safe. But 2008 crash only comes once in a long time. 
modgill	Good riddance
modgill	The strangest thing ever is that, When i party up with Europeans, (being in india myself). The match goes on perfectly fine. Yes, its mostly 2 bars or 3 bars. But the match is 99% perfect, without much lag etc.   And when i party up with Americans, its the same if not better.   But when im playing in my region which is Asia, the lag is freaking horrible. About 30% of the time.   But whenever im playing with europeans and americans. no issues whatsoever.   I think it is HIGH TIME, that Naughty Dog removes the region lock all together and at the very least, Expand the Region Lock size. 
modgill	Because I want to file higher return. 
modgill	Yes balance sheet is prepared. Which is done by my accountant whom I pay rs4000 a month.   
modgill	Actually he charged me 500 to 800 before.   I think with all the bullshit happening now. They are overcharging 
modgill	What do you think I should do? Now he is asking for rs 2000.   Can I file myself? Is it free to file it yourself?   
modgill	Yes turnover is less then 2crores. It's actually only 30lakhs.   Profit is 5 lakhs.   But CA says all balance sheet has to be uploaded.   
modgill	Income Tax Return (Proprietor Business) | Okay,   i have a company, on which i have around 5-6 lakhs profit. And i have to file this before 5th of August apparently.   Now the CA who is filing and used to file my returns used to take Rs 800 for each return previously.   This time around he is asking for Rs 3000, just to file the return  and also suggesting that for every business proprietor they are charging upwards of 7000rs.  can i get a better rate elsewhere?? 
modgill	Damn I never knew this. 200 hours of red dead and after so many years I find this. I'm gutted to say the least 
modgill	Money printing is at all time high. Hence inflation will keep rising and so will stocks worldwide. 
modgill	It's my favourite song and I am long time Pink Floyd fan. Sorry but bust your nuts. But it has always been receding. I sang alone without looking it up and it has always been the same. Receding 
modgill	I have zero loans, paid off all my car loans last year during demonetization etc.   ANd i have had around 4 credit cards so far in my 9 years. Defaults on 4 of them, maybe like total 6 lakhs. Did OTS with them in all 4 occasions.   saved 5,50 Lakhs.   Now one bank again gave me 1 lakh limit card. lol. i think all this CIBIL and rest is bullshit.   Given the trying conditions economy is in, they will give credit card to whoever they can. and i will keep ripping off the banks.   hahahahaha. 
modgill	Deustche bank has a policy where if some suspect withdraws upto 2 lakhs, or buys with card upto 2 lakhs, its SAFE. no questions asked. 
modgill	Damn. They ruled in favor of bank is very telling of the system here in India. Good gesture by the bank. As they didn't want to loose the customer 
modgill	Damn, it's gonna be difficult to find a buyer. Anyway good luck. 
modgill	Just saying brother. Peace
modgill	I have a friend who uses modded controller. After he switched controllers be became an amazing player. Who always uses enforcer as sidearm. Which shoots like an assault rifle. 
modgill	Enhanced with snapseed 
modgill	Still relevant 
modgill	Maan Aluminium and possibly reliance
modgill	Wtf u on about 
modgill	U got 100 of maan at 100. Thats 10,000 Rs.   Price goes to 130. Thats 13,000Rs worth.   Sell 10,000rs worth of Maan & keep 3000rs Worth shares of Maan, which are essentially free. as your principal is back. 
modgill	/u/bikermonk   Now check maan aluminium. Its out of circuit and now in Upper Circuit, and this will continue till 110 and possibly uptil 130. And if you want, you can exit then with a small fortune.   But if you want multibagger return, then wait for around 2-3 years. but my advice is, at 130 or 120. Book profit and keep free shares. 
modgill	I agree to this. Yesterday we had to wait 10.minutes to find a tdm game.   And late joins are absolutely horrific.   Even old killzone or resistance games took 30 seconds for matchmaking
modgill	Don't look at any reports. Check edelweiss analysis. That's it.   Also I have around 30k of Maan stock. It moved up continuously for many days. Just relax. Average your holding when circuit opens.   Also look at shilpi. 20 to 50. Now back to 40. If it comes to 20 buy that too. 
modgill	Nice. Get to work naughty dog
modgill	If you don't get set in  1 single king size joint. Then your stuff is weak.   I get set in 1 Joint. And smoke very judiciously like twice a month. 
modgill	Hold onto Maan as well. It's up 70% in 4 months. Some correction has come. Which is natural.   
modgill	Hold onto Maan as well. It's up 70% in 4 months. Some correction has come. Which is natural.   
modgill	Hold onto Maan as well. It's up 70% in 4 months. Some correction has come. Which is natural.   
modgill	Check indianvideogamer.com forums. They have a trade forum, which is very active. I usually trade there
modgill	Agarwal pistol only loadout for me is godly. 1 headshot 1 body down. It's amazing.   I usually play with agarwal only in remnants, rooftops and few other maps. 
modgill	Hold onto Maan & Coal India both.   Coal india is in its Cyclical stage of 250 to 325 every year. 
modgill	Sp is a great person and analyst. I think he right 
modgill	What's LOA
modgill	ELSS vs MFs | A known person of mine wants to convert his MFs into ELSS.   Is it advisable? I think even equity MFs of more then 1 year holding is tax free. I may be wrong. 
modgill	Mandela Effect and Parallel Universe described and happened in Ancient India and written in Book "Ramayana​" | Okay this is bit complex but if you understand it then you will realise that Mandela Effect, Parallel Universe and different timelines have long existed in Hindu culture and its mentioned in the  book called Ramayana.   Basically it happens when the Demi-God Rama is about to die. He sends his adherent follower "Hanumana" away to a different timeline via a wormhole to find his missing Ring where little things have changed.   And then he goes to another timeline where Rama missing rings are kept in a same place and have become a mountain of rings. This place serves as a connected Universe where all happenings across multiple timelines are kept.   And this book was first written around 1000 B.C which was passed down people to people orally for around 9000 years. And is the best description found in Ancient texts of all things we are discussing here.   To me this is proof that we are onto something and it's not a new phenomenon.   Edit : https://youtu.be/emwG_A1DAUE  Above video link vaguely describes What incident I'm talking about. Although my translation is slightly different from his. But same result. 
modgill	Not at all. Blood and wine is better then most rpg out there.
modgill	I am infact not a Gill, but Modgill. and that a real surname. We (modgill brahmins) basically originated in Iran alongside Zoroastrians and later persecuted by muslims there and throw out of the country totally in 1800s. Then zoroastrians (parsis) stayed in Bombay and Modgill's shifted inwards to "mudgalya" near Kaas Pathar, Pune.   but well, Jat people from Shiva's locks probably seems like a political thing as it was propagated in 1900s itself. 
modgill	Yes
modgill	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x32_bdT4L_w  Check this video, the origins and types of Vampires in Hindu Folklore. Even Active today. 
modgill	Damn I didn't know this until u told me.   http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-maha-shivratri-why-cern-the-world-s-largest-particle-physics-lab-has-a-statue-of-lord-shiva-2186655  Read this, but damn, they quoted Fritjof Capra and that's the only Physics books I have ever read. "The Tao of physics"   What are the odds?   My mind is stunned. 
modgill	Also shiva creates river ganges, created marijuana, epihedra and used to drink intoxicated and healthy drink called Som Rasa.   But he embraces everything, even dark things and the dark side loves him too and respects him, and thereby creating a balance on earth. Makes logical sense too. 
modgill	That is an incredible piece of Damning Evidence. If she is indeed talking about Sinbad Genie movie Shazaam.   To be honest, why would she specifically remember that? because it was Real in the REAL REALITY. 
modgill	Too many to write. Shiva controls them too
modgill	Never seen a cloud like that, thats crazy but not an ME or anything. 
modgill	Well that's ur opinion, which is not shared by 99% of players who played w3. I played 500 hours of witcher 3, and gwent is greatest card game ever. Even got a standalone now. 
modgill	alot didnt have a wiggly line for me. and seems to be correct. Whats the fuss about? Alot has always been alot and still is. And even my Word processor and apple keyboard says alot is correct , WTF?   
modgill	Shiva embraces everything. That's the main thing. He loves all. The creation of marijuana in Hindu mythology is one of the most epic tale. You should search for it.   Bhutas and pretas are just ghosts and spirits and even they bow to shiva as he has all control over them. 
modgill	Speak for yourself. Witcher 3 is hands down best ever game ever made. 
modgill	Ram ratna wires, but wait for 10 or 20 percent correction for full dip. 
modgill	I don't know what u mean exactly. I only know it helps with physical aches and body issues. Is chill, relaxing and beautiful.   I don't think it's spiritual per say. But our God Shiva did create it 
modgill	Naah its not conviction. It's just a short term gamble. But a gamble which can give u 2x returns within a month. People panicked and sold at losses.   I waited for bottom, averaged and again in profit. Stock market is beautiful if u can play it 
modgill	I'll only say this.   The more you know, the less you understand - Tao ti Ching 
modgill	Capital gain bonds r shit. With shit cagr.. My point is better. 
modgill	Listen, I ain't offended. But marijuana is no drug. It's a naturally occurring plant. Which revitalises our cabbanoid system. Reduces body pains. And for me it treats my IBS for a month with 1 joint.   It will never gain traction, because it eliminates a lot of pharma companies. Who Keep people sick with disguised medicines which cure one thing but produces another problem. 
modgill	Sorry what??? Leave weed alone. We Indians have been smoking it since 2000 years. It's beautiful, lovely. All chill and makes u relaxed. And helps with lot of body pains and aches. 
mommywantstodie	I can't do this anymore | I am losing the fight against my brain.  I cannot see any way to get out of this situation, and every single day is so  painful, from morning until night.  I can't work.  I can hardly get to therapy.  I can hardly be a good mom.  My brain is attacking me, telling me how worthless, ugly, unloved I am, that it will never get better, I have no energy, terrible sleep, don't want to eat.  I get no pleasure from any single thing, not tv, not music, not movies.  I am just waiting to sleep, all day every day.  I am literally nothing and not worth a single thing to anyone except my kids, who would be better off without me.  They are already half at their dad's.  The weeks in silence when they are gone is unbearable.  I have all these pills next to me, and then the pain can stop.  The world will instantly move on and/or actually be better off.     I have no idea why I need to post this here.  For some reason I want to say it to someone and just have less than no one to say it to.    How do I let my children know that it wasn't their fault, in fact the opposite.  I want them to grow up knowing how much I loved them, which was so much it is painful.  But I know they are better off without me.  I guess I will start recording some videos and leave it for their dad.
mommywantstodie	Well that is really sad.  I can so vividly imagine and almost feel the fear/pain (and shame) she was going through for those hours.  I think I can also fairly clearly imagine how shocked you must have been and continue to be.  I could have so easily gotten to this stage with my ex.    There were a couple instances with my ex (where we were both drunk) where I refused to let him leave, blocking the door.  It either forced him to become a bit physical and/or forced him to threaten to call the police and make recordings as well.  I remember that I was just so terrified that he was going to leave and never come back, that this was the last moment with him if he left, and I was willing to go to extraordinary lengths to stop that from happening.  Inside I just wanted things to be OK, I loved him so much and knew I could instantly switch off whatever drove us to that point, I was so immensely sorry, but also couldn't control myself enough to let him go and diffuse the situation.  I was just so scared.  He would use silence treatment techniques after big arguments, so I knew I was at least in for that when he left.  And those were so painful I couldn't go through them again.    :(   I still get moments of this much anxiety where I'll flip out and start calling my ex dozens of times, or reaching out to him on literally every SM platform possible, getting myself deeper and deeper into no contact.  But it's been 5 days now and I have stopped, and I hope that it was the last time I did that.  I feel a bit more acceptance now since my last psychiatry/psychologist appointments this week and starting some DBT techniques.  Just reminding myself to act like an adult and to love myself first, being able to comfort myself, instead of putting so much importance on his love, if that makes sense.  Just working on my confidence in general helps.  Trying to stop being so scared and realize that the very worst has happened already, it's done and I can't change it.  And I am still here.  Sometimes it feels like barely still here, but I am getting through it, so hopefully I can find strength in this feeling in the future as well.  So sorry to you both.  I want to say thanks for coming to this forum and asking others with BPD, I think that's really thoughtful and it's great to get different perspectives.  And I'm glad you realize she is deep down not evil and respect her progress.  You really are in a position of a lot of power, and she is essentially a weak child at the moment, mentally.  Maybe she's not as scary as you think.  I don't want pity, but honestly, it is a pitiful state that we are in in these moments.  Showing love or compassion in any way possible helps so much, if you have any feeling that you want to help her progress.  Even if that's just by standing along side her (carefully and from a distance) with therapy, like you mentioned.  Or letting her have some contact with you while having very solid boundaries, with known consequences if they are broken.  Or letting her know you'll be around again in x months, after progress has been made.  Even if you really end up gradually disappearing, and have no interest in getting back together, just saying these things make a world of a difference in our minds and stops a lot of the panic.
mommywantstodie	If there is anything I regret in this experience, it's being open about my diagnosis of borderline to him and others.  Everyone I've told now has a justification for essentially any argument against me, any topic.  My ex has full justification and support to completely disappear, because of borderline, which just continues to be so unbelievable to me.  My ex-husband, no matter the topic, can always, always point to my "disorder".  I should have not exposed myself.  My situation would be totally different now, I'm sure of it.  I now look like a damaged person and I cannot come out looking strong or correct in any scenario where I am upset or disagree.  I feel like I'm permanently wrong to anyone who knows about the bpd.  That being said, I am very glad I know about BPD and I do wholeheartedly believe I have the symptoms that go along with this disorder.  To what extent, I am not sure, I do not believe that we're all the same, I do not believe we should all be thrown into a box with this label and treated exactly the same.  But the reason I am continuing with therapy is to re-learn how to manage my emotions, and/or gain some new tools in order to do so.  It's quite clear that from a young age I was exhibiting these symptoms and I am paying for it now, by being alone and without friends, and many other things in my life.  I think the symptoms I have are the base for the causes of my depression and anxiety.  So I would definitely like to get better.
mommywantstodie	Worst thing i ever did, telling anyone.  As I just said in another comment, I'm now permanently wrong to all who know.
mommywantstodie	Well, this is literally the exact same thing I'm going through.    He was truly my only support.  I have no friends (spent three years only with him, all day every day, and am otherwise quite busy), live in a foreign country, with my parents thousands of miles away.    He has blocked me on every single thing possible.  It's like he enjoys it.  Surely he enjoys the control.  He promised me he would never do this.  Little kids are involved as well.  The thing that set it off seemed somewhat trivial as well, and he had said something very very similar just a few months back.  I also had just come back from a long trip to America, which he had built up in his mind as something devastating and something he could not recover from, even though not one thing happened against him.  I signed up for all the DBT therapy and medication directed at borderline primarily to work on our relationship.  I'm still going to go (next apt tomorrow, yay), but he was my main focus.  I wanted to get better for him.  He promised he would be here and he left.  Trust is gone, at this point I would never forgive him, it is the most heinous thing you can do the another person.  Trust is gone for any other person as well, so I guess he really triumphed in the end.   I'm SO so so so sorry you are going through this.  Does he go on these forums and research a lot too?  It is such a nightmare, it is just flooded with angry, cowardly, emotionally unintelligent people who shout at anyone to leave us and bail on us and that it's the only way, regardless if we're accepting of treatment or not.  I am sure he is or was only getting advice from these "anti-borderline" sites and subreddits.  Did he ever accept any blame in the relationship or he felt like your problems were way bigger and the only thing to solve?  Did he ever plan to attend therapy with you?
mommywantstodie	Haha, awesome.  As my dad always said, you don't have to be normal, just act normal.  
mommywantstodie	Just be careful. If you are with someone as mean and heartless as I was, he will notice all these fears and make it a reality as his final KO move and to hurt you as much as humanly possible.  I gave him too much information, trusted him too much, overshared, and my fears became reality. :(  Just try to be nice to yourself. Tell yourself you're lovable just the same as you were a few hours before you noticed his mood shift. It will come back, just don't force things the opposite direction, just stay calm and listen to some uplifting upbeat music with some headphones.
mommywantstodie	Good luck.  I think we are naturally attracted to emotional men ourselves, maybe?  I see a lot of partners who eventually decide to hate us and ignore the disorder part, go no contact, etc.  It's awful.    I think what is so important is trying to figure out how to love ourselves first.  Look to ourselves for confirmation, look for soothing from ourselves.  That way when they don't show love, we can fall back on knowing that we're still lovable and good people.  I hope I can get there fully...honestly just literally thinking the words "I love myself" seems to help sometimes.  
mommywantstodie	He sounds great, and I'm so happy to hear things are back on track.  Sounds like you got through it without a meltdown, so that's progress!  :)
mommywantstodie	Yes, looking back I should have had a lot more trust in his feelings for me.  He did do a lot to show it.  I was really, really quick to jump on any perceived change in his mood, new quietness, etc and think that he was instantly out of love with me.  I would never take into consideration what else might be going on and I always wanted him to be instantly 100% transparent, like I was when things are going wrong (always oversharing with him).  If he didn't act as I wanted I would start arguments over this, out of fear and trying to find he answer.  Definitely should have done better here.  Funny though, he did similar when I was a little cool or distant.  He wouldn't drill into me normally, unless he was drunk and feeling really jealous at the same time, that was chaos.  But otherwise I think he'd be a bit sweeter to me, and just have this cute concerned look.  Whereas I would really start panicking.  I can see that was probably annoying now.  
mommywantstodie	Thanks, this reads very similarly to how my ex seemed to describe things or how other partners on here do.  Very true thay I always felt like someone who is very analytical and good at reading people. So I guess it's likely that I am genuinely better at digging in and hurting them at their core.   I definitely have a hard time imagining their side though, because I am very very open by nature, expose all my vulnerabilities, and took a huge amount of criticism, insults, and accusations during the relationship. But those things would never hurt me the same way.  In my view, my ex was generally never walking on egg shells, he was volatile and very emotional himself and neither one of us seemed to be able to stay calm for a second, constantly triggering each other. At the very end things changed because I became very closed for the first time and went into depression. Which he misunderstood and took as my falling out of love, not appreciating him, possibly cheating, etc. None were true. And this is when any arguments really started to have a heavy impact on the relationship.   But anyways, I haven't heard of mbt therapy and will look into it as well.
mommywantstodie	That sounds like two separate statements.  My post was trying to explain my point of view.  Definitely not claim to be correct in any of it.    Trying to remember what seemed to hurt him the most.  Probably things that made him feel less of a man.  Or said he was too emotional.  Called him a liar.  Weak.  Jealous.  Etc.  These were very, very hurtful things to him.  And I believe he feels like things he revealed to me about himself (when he was being emotional, perhaps), I later used against him.  For me it doesn't feel that way at all, he has never been an open book.  The moments he did break down were always really healing for both of us, from my point of view.  He seems to decide to take it in a negative way now, to make his points.  But I can be wrong.  I am trying to see it from his perspective.  But take it in the reverse - how many times I was told I am basically an unworthy, terrible person (in 1000 different ways? - not to mention the most harsh way to tell someone, with no contact).  A crazy person.  Incredibly overly emotional.  A bitch.  Jealous.  A procrastinator.  A manipulator.  Etc.  But I'm still here.  I until the last two days have continued to try to work things out in some way or another, try to break through the wall.  I don't feel permanently damaged by his statements, or anyone's, I just feel empowered by them because I know I'm taking them seriously, I trust them, and want to do better.  I only felt really damaged when he decided I'm not worth working on things together and walks away.
mommywantstodie	How did he react and what did I say to trigger those reactions?    You have approximately 0.00001% of my/our story, your confidence in your statements is odd.  I think so far I've given you the following info, with some added context:   * I hurt him and he feels I'm hateful.   * He has also hurt me by ditching me. (*many times throughout the relationship) * I said hurtful things, from my perspective not any more hurtful than many things he's said or actions he's done to me. * I am hurt differently, my strongest pain is from being abandoned, his seems to be attacks on his character or things he has worked on himself.  (*I don't know how you can measure which is worse or which one deserves any kind of reaction.) * He's gone no contact * I never gave up and in fact took his perspective seriously and took action on it and continue to
mommywantstodie	I could see he was upset, but his way of being upset was also very different (and considerably more closed) than mine.  So I am left to alot of assumptions, I guess.  I assumed he was overreacting, or wrong, or damaged himself.   I would continue to try to convince him of any of these things.  Instead of just realize that he has a totally different life experience (I still believe possibly a disorder) and that not everyone is going to be hurt like I am.  Or ever even have the capability to understand other life experiences or viewpoints, through my endless explanations.  Just like I am missing the capability to react differently than I do now in certain situations, without a huge amount of professional help.
mommywantstodie	I am so tempted to go off on a tangent from what you wrote.  I won't.  But man, I have a constant feeling that there is something really off with bpd diagnoses and the partners who are extremely vocal about us.  I bet there are some really interesting statistics to dig into.  Especially if you put everyone on an even playing board; e.g. the data comes from couples who are both going to the same psychiatrist, full backgrounds uncovered, etc.
mommywantstodie	Well, I'm more certain that it's a trait of mine.  The post was intended to figure out if it's truly a common BPD trait, but obviously it's not unheard of in these forums.  I see constant complaints of rage.  
mommywantstodie	Why are we so angry/mean? | As I have done mediation/in depth talks with my ex-partner and ex-husband about their experience with me, the word "hateful" has come up a few times.  While the ending for both of these relationships was very different and for different reasons, and both had entirely different reactions to me, I found that descriptor to be eye-opening.  And of course it seems to go along with the symptoms of bpd quite well.    I think there is a difference between angry and hateful, though.  Do most here consider themselves or have been told that they are hateful, mean, ripping out the soul of a man and stomping on it, etc?  I feel like I can reflect back to my moments of "hatred" and I do actually have reasoning behind them:  * I am trying to express an emotion, thought, or point of my own in a very strong way.   * I feel extremely hurt by some action or lack of action on their part and am trying to convey that same hurt so that they understand.  And finally, I always feel like I would be able to take the same kind of talking to without much issue.  I feel like I have pretty thick skin.  So when I say these things, I don't always recognize or believe their impact on another person who cannot communicate emotionally the same way I can.  And at the same I kind of believe hurting can be a good thing, at times, because you become vulnerable and are more open to listening.  That was especially the case with my last relationship.  On both sides, I think.  I think I've read a few times that pwBPD tend to hate those they love the most.  To me it feels like that's absolutely true; it just sometimes becomes unbearable when someone I am so open with (literally am only open with them in this way and feel that I've devoted everything to them) doesn't understand me.  So I take extreme measures.  But in the very end, the reason I do it is to help them understand me more, and I feel receptive to them talking to me and kind of hope they will in the same way. This rarely happens, because obviously they are not me.  But my ultimate goal is to become more connected to that person.  Arguing never bothered me much, as long as there wasn't risk of abandonment, I think.  It's only when that person goes away, or appears to, that I panic.  But otherwise I could argue all night and usually be fine immediately after or the next morning, walking away totally unscathed.  I think I'm writing this as if my angry moments were semi-sophisticated.  To be fair, my words get very, very ugly and out of control at times.  But I guess I mean that they had reasoning when I started, or reasoning somewhere behind them.  Obviously this seems not to be at all how others, at least those without bpd, think or respond.  I don't think how I act is justified, it's just how I learned to behave, for some reason.  I imagine DBT therapy must attack this very issue.  But just wondering if anyone else feels similarly.
mommywantstodie	Love this kind of information and detail.  Love learning about the brain.  I have a rabbit hole to jump into, thanks!  
mommywantstodie	> Does that mean if you can take it, everyone else is capable of taking it too?  No, that's why in my original comment I said I know my thinking on this is wrong and not like people without bpd.  I definitely don't think, at this point, that everyone else is capable and/or should take it.  A year ago?  I would have said something different.  > But do you perceive the majority of things directed towards you as a criticism?  I think I really take it seriously when someone is angry or upset with me, especially someone I care about.  So I take it as both, criticism and opportunities for growth.  And I've received tons of this.  And I'm the kind of person who can absolutely get the "worst" anger out of someone, so yes, I've definitely had my fair share of criticism and ugly words and out of control behavior thrown my way.  And this again, is the exact reason I am diagnosed borderline and getting therapy and even on this forum.  Because of things other people have said about me.  In the reverse, for example in my last relationship, accusations of their flaws by me are entirely dismissed, considered "horrible and hurtful, manipulative, avoiding my own issues" and so on, and they do nothing with it.  Seems like.
mommywantstodie	I cannot tell you how many times recently I have had the image of an abused dog, like the ones I've seen on youtube, as a depiction of how I feel inside.  Terrible comparison but that's the only way I can describe the pain I am having from abandonment.
mommywantstodie	Well, I went into that in what I wrote above.  I am generally thick skinned and don't come away from arguments very hurt - UNLESS I feel I am being abandoned.  Then I react very severely and the pain does not go away.  But words?  I take criticism fairly well, can reflect inwardly...that's part of why I'm here.  Listening to others (harsh) criticisms of me.
mommywantstodie	Definitely not.  We triggered each other pretty easily.  Anyways, again you miss the point of my statement.  I just meant that what I view as hurtful to another person is only based on what is hurtful to me.  Which again, for me, is abandonment.  Which I basically would have never done to him, ever.  But words never really hurt me much, and I don't mind taking some blame and working a lot on myself.  He has the opposite reaction.  My definition of hurtful is different than his, and I until recently haven't been able to see that clearly.  He does not fear abandonment, he fears words and feels wounded by criticism at what he has built up himself.
mommywantstodie	Mindfulness then, sounds like the solution.  Noted and will start on that tomorrow, it's been a while.  :)  Funny how I've forgotten my own toolkit, I am so deep in this.
mommywantstodie	I can so relate.  Sometimes I feel like we're diagnosed only because we're actively attempting to fix ourselves.  And literally anyone who goes to the psychiatrist or self reflects this much, tries to fix themselves this much, is going to come up with some personality disorder.  So when you have two people in a relationship, one who isn't actively trying to understand their own brain and reactions and environment growing up, and one who isn't...how can that be fair.  It's not.  We also become somewhat of an expert in this field, spending countless hours researching borderline, how other personality disorders react with borderline, seeing all these experiences on reddit.  Yet the other "side" becomes biased, simply looking confirmation for their hatred or severe reactions and getting justified by others who feel just as hurt as they do.  Not really learning in the same way.
mommywantstodie	Well no, not really.  That's what I meant by all of this, that this isn't the main intention.  I suppose my brain goes to things which can hurt others, but the responses I get really vary greatly between people.  And like I said, I am thick skinned myself, so "hurtful" to me means something different.
mommywantstodie	Self soothing by obsessing? | Sorry for all the posts, just stuff running through my mind.  I am also curious if this is similar for any others here, or if this may be related more to some sort of obsessive compulsive traits I have.    The most calm I feel, the most at peace I feel, are when my brain gets to the following places:  * Hating and feeling like I'm somehow above him, trying erase the past or only think negatively.  I get a huge confidence boost for a minute.  or, much more frequently:  * Obsessing and obsessing and obsessing over the positives.  Almost like day dreaming.  This is kind of primarily what I do, to get through the empty weeks where I am alone with my thoughts.  I do stuff like, search back through our chats, look at all our old pictures, or mainly, just sit back and think back of his smell, his voice, every piece of him, every positive moment.  While the above scenario, when I'm hating, is definitely soothing temporarily, doing this positive thinking is beyond comforting.  It becomes like a game in my head, or like meditating, on him.  I feel warm, feel emotional, usually cry.  Can actually feel happy for a few seconds on each good memory I dig up.  God I sound like a CREEP.  But yeah.  And very often, I feel like I'm in love with him all over again and have trouble not reaching out to him.    It's so obsessive and constant I wonder if it has anything to do with bpd at all.  My mom has OCD.  God, so many disorders, they're everywhere.  My brain is totally malfunctioning.  It also feels like I just have excuse after excuse for my behaviors.  I don't want to excuse them anymore.  I've tried to get the idea in my head to move on, meet someone else, gone on Tinder etc.  But as soon as anyone starts messaging me I feel totally freaked out and guilty, like I am doing something wrong.  It feels gross. I just don't want anyone else now, no way could I start up something.    Haven't started meds or therapy yet, and can imagine it will help a bit on this.  But again, it's not really a bad thing, it feels like soothing in a weird way.  It's just soothing that doesn't really ultimately benefit me because I can't move forward.
mommywantstodie	Try writing things down or (a bit more scary), recording it.  Reading or listening later can either verify your original thinking or be weird, and you won't recognize it.
mommywantstodie	That sounds so amazing.  Sounds like you found a great one, a rock.  All the best to you two.  Don't forget to work on yourself too.  :)
mommywantstodie	Me too.  I am in severe depression for about a year now.  It's hard not to think back to the wonderful, drug-like experiences of my last relationship.  I am starting meds soon and I find it so sad, that most likely whatever mood stabilizer I'm going to be prescribed, is going to take that extreme-positive side away from me too.  I don't want to be on medication forever, I hope that the DBT therapy will help enough eventually that I can manage at least the anger and mood swings, and still maintain my old overly emotional, sexy, confident, happy and adoring positive side.  It makes life so wonderful.  And it's so nice to adore someone, and put them on a pedestal.  It's so nice to be captivated by everything about a person, every flaw even.  Though part of me still believes it was the person, and our unique chemical attraction, not the bpd, since I never had it before with anyone else.  But maybe not.  But in general my life has been filled with so many good moments where I was just captivated by the world and everything in it, being brought to tears of joy often about things like food, music, movies, the night sky.  It's great.  But, right now, I'm attempting to force myself to look back at those positive moments as part of my illness, erase it all, tell myself that it wasn't real, that I wasn't really loved nor did I love him.  It was all unhealthy from both sides and a huge mistake.  I don't necessarily believe all of it but I'm trying to.  Learning experience. Just looking to be even and stable (and boring) for a while.
mommywantstodie	Aw :x 
mommywantstodie	I haven't started DBT therapy yet.  I'm set up to, the Dutch system takes ages to get through.  I should be on medication around the next week or so. I looked up some of the strategies and read about isolating all the emotions, where you feel them, identifying which is primary and secondary, etc.  I was able to do this but it was also during a time of a lot more blame on myself.    The no contact thing makes me spiral out of control, I just obsess on it non stop and my brain just looks for a way out of it, and I lose sight of myself and any progress.  I stop being able to function normally.  Maybe it's some of my ocpd...  But to answer your question, I feel fear and anger, and underneath all that is surely all the sadness.  I feel the anger in my head, my shoulders mostly, chest.    I do want to recover and it is literally the primary goal of mine, just waiting to get through the process here.  I know being so angry isn't helpful, but yeah, I'm clearly triggered pretty badly from no contact which says a lot in itself.  
mommywantstodie	Thanks, going to order something like this while I'm waiting for my therapy to start.
mommywantstodie	You're not wrong.  But I've spent a few weeks, months, a year now in deep depression, where I've done nothing but blame myself.  Honestly, it feels like some kind of step forward to be angry.  Anger also allows me to attempt to brainwash (maybe it's useful/correct brainwashing) myself into thinking that this wasn't love, that we were both abusive towards each other, and fight against my nature to think back to the positive, and think back to the negative over and over again as a reminder.  This is what he's doing after all, and it's clearly working.    You're right that I can't control his reaction and I'm not doing any good to try to force it.  I thought for a moment yesterday, what would happen if he answered one of my dozens of phone calls.  He'd answer in anger and frustration, I'd react in the same, and we'd be no where better.   
mommywantstodie	Yes, recently by two-three separate doctors.
mommywantstodie	Feeling really, really angry. | So my anger bubble burst today, after weeks of trying to be patient and calm, and expecting my ex boyfriend to come to his senses at some point. He went "no contact" a month ago or so. For the past few days I feel this deep resentment and anger towards this person. We still work together. He helped me raise my kids for 1/3rd of their life. He promised he'd never desert us in the past, he promised he'd never go no contact, many times this year.  This is a person who is by far, the most insecure person I've ever met in my life. I've presumably been BPD all my life, but he is the only one who has ever reacted remotely close to this out of any of my relationships. I'm starting to believe, since literally every single person in any of the related subreddits do is talk about relationships, and so many posts are clearly from men who are severely damaged themselves, that the more appropriate forums for us would be one for BPD and Narcissists Codependents. There is some kind of a toxic mix here, it's NOT just BPD. It's the way our exes react to us, as well. It's the type of men/women who have this extreme reaction to our emotions, who feel so incredibly hurt and cannot realize that it's a disorder, cannot disconnect, have huge open wounds from their childhood. All the other men I dated had a "oh, silly girl, calm down. Nothing happened. Let's go get ice cream" kind of reaction, and would go about their day. The most vocal partners on reddit and anywhere else, all seem like they are bitter, all seem like they have extreme reactions and emotions themselves, and they're all supporting each other with the most useless, cruel advice. Seeing it makes me nauseous. They are all so clearly screwed up and hateful people themselves. Not one of them reflects back on their own behaviors. Not one of them is trying to learn. They are only looking to blame, and justify their own behaviors. Have heartless reactions. It is by the book narcissism. r/BPD is so different, it is filled with people who are TRYING to understand, trying to work on themselves, trying to reflect inward, getting therapy, etc.  I know everyone says, DON'T read it. But it's all over the internet. And it's a fucking problem. Their reactions and methods of coping are the antithesis of healing - for us or for themselves! I feel like no contact is inhumane, is lower than low, is the most cowardly thing you can do. I am at the point that I feel I'm literally willing to do anything to break it. Anything. I am getting angrier by the second because I KNOW I did not do anything to deserve this kind of severe reaction, he's just using it as a coping mechanism and because he can't handle any kind of criticism whatsoever. It's not like I ever cheated on him, not even remotely close. It's not like I killed his whole family. Then it would feel legitimate.  It just feels utterly unacceptable. My kids are asking about him CONSTANTLY, because of course they notice a big contrast and that he is gone. They miss him and say they miss him every week. It is so hard to hear. I tell him this, and even asked if he could just keep in touch with them once in a while, and he is actually so fucking heartless that he can't do that. It makes me physically ill that someone can be this narcissistic and without feelings. I feel as I have been scorned, and even worse that my children have been thrown aside as well, and it's feeling more and more completely unforgivable. Like what an utter piece of shit this person is, the emotional intelligence of a neanderthal. Similar to deadbeat biological Dads who just get up and walk away from their own kids when things are tough. While I know I have extreme emotions, I've analyzed my situation to death and no contact seems like a fucking bizarre, horrifyingly inhuman reaction. I'm starting to think of him like my enemy. Like who does he think he is, that he can get away with this? He won't.  Anyways, I am going crazy, I feel like I am willing to take things to the very extreme here to break no contact, including risking my/our job or harass him to the point of getting thrown in jail. Our story has a lot of detail surrounding this, so I hope I can be met with understanding here and not being told "he has every right..." etc. While I admit I have BPD tendencies, I also am very good at looking at things from every angle, I have looked over my interactions with him (chats etc) and thought about things for countless upon countless hours, and I know for a fact that the no contact was unwarranted in our case, even my therapists agree, and that this is more about his insecurity and being the type of person who "has to win" and force his points.  I am not even close to attempting to get back together with him, I do not need him to suddenly be my boyfriend again, or force anything like that. But being treated like a leper, like a woman who is worth nothing, it makes everything 100 times worse than they have to be. We do not have to have any ugliness whatsoever and it's like he's forcing it to be that way, and only making my BPD emotions flair up more and more and more, piling up until I explode. I am almost there. All he would have to do is treat me with understanding instead of hate and there would be zero problem.  Am I the only one? Does this ring a bell with anyone? Am I acting more extreme than a pwBPD at this point? Or perhaps I might be justified in some ways? Perhaps many normal people in my situation would react like this?
mommywantstodie	> You have to see that people are attracted to people for a reason, and that when a person changes inside a relationship, it causes problems with the relationship dynamic. As shocking as it is for a partner to turn abusive, it can be equally as unnerving for a partner to become healthy, or confident.  This must be true.  He thrived from my being obsessed with him for the duration of the relationship.  He was terribly insecure and in an unhappy marriage, and he felt I was "out of his league", that I was some prize.  When at the end, years later, I started to close up and shut down, go quiet, because he was so overly jealous, violent, emotional, that's when things became really ugly, and he quickly gave up entirely and resorted to hate and blame and completely closing up, accusing me of everything in the book.  He only believed the reality he would make up, literally didn't listen to a word I said, even though I was completely in it for the long run and loyal to him - his ego was broken again and he couldn't bear it.  So back into his shell he went.  I can so easily imagine that if we got back together after I have significant therapy and medication, that I would be a totally different person; without the worshipping and idolizing and general extremes.  He would still be the same person with the same needs to fill his lack of confidence, since he hasn't had any treatment and refuses to work on himself, only blame me.  So we would be unmatched, even when I start/finish my therapies/meds.  I think you're right, it wasn't true love, it was serious dependency on one another for things we were missing.  While I feel so good to finally have something to work from (bpd), it wouldn't solve things in this relationship.  It would put me in a higher position in the relationship, which I was to begin with, and that obviously didn't and wouldn't work with the type of person he is.  The only way we could work, as my mom has said, as my therapists have said, is if we were in this together, working to learn tools to work with each other better, and he is clearly not interested because it's too painful for him to admit his wrong doings.  That's the part that hurts the most, that I'm not worth it, but that's what he's shouting loud and clear by blocking me everywhere.  I pity him, at least I am in a place of growth, or at least rock bottom where the only way is up.  Not a place of denial, not of blame.  I can improve.  Maybe it's a good idea to start telling myself this wasn't love at all, from either side.  Just deep wounds on both ends being patched over by each other.  It wasn't love.  He wasn't my soulmate.  It was a mistake at a time where I was weak in some areas, and so was he.  I was foolish to let him into my life, I was foolish to become so dependent on him, I was foolish to introduce him to my kids.  I see now while I gave him total trust, I should have given him none.  For Christ's sake he ditched his wife and one year old child to be with me.  Obviously his priorities were not based out of love, but to improve his confidence.  When I stopped giving the confidence, I was tossed out with the trash.  Case and point.  Lesson learned.  I can do so much better.  Thanks again, you're amazing.  Here's hoping I can remember this conversation for a few days, weeks, months, and continue to feel empowered.    
mommywantstodie	Throughout the relationship I thought over and over, "one of us is going to kill each other".  "This is what historical tragic love stories, where someone ends up murdered, are about."  It was so, so extreme.  Not only the bad, the good just as much.  I guess it feels like withdrawal from heroin.    Thank you for this, I am going to keep re-reading this and it has really helped me tonight.  I do believe it was an abusive relationship, both ways, and even if I did heal myself, he's not emotionally mature or interested enough to heal himself, so there is really no point.  I thought that since we discovered my BPD, and that I am fully open to it and starting medication within a week or so, that we shouldn't give up on it.    Thank you so much for reading all of my blabbering.  I think I read in another post you are very young?  I am so impressed by how clearly and rationally you write.  If you aren't already, you should be doing something in the lines of this kind of work, seriously.
mommywantstodie	Where do I buy this?
mommywantstodie	Try living with someone who you were with for 3 years, nearly all day every day.  This is while, going through a divorce and ending up with half/half custody for my children.  Then they totally sever ties out of nowhere.  Now, my days are deafening silence with no partner, no kids, no friends, or overwhelmingly busy with kids by myself.  Every week it changes.  It's a huge contrast.  I am barely able to function normally.  I can't normalize the schedule in my brain.  It's like every week i start over.  I hate my life.  The loneliness is crushing and something no one should have to go through.
mommywantstodie	Hey, look on the bright side.  He's right there with you, telling you he's not going to leave you.  He isn't even close, that's why he's laughing.  Mine left me, went "no contact".  Just be thankful he hasn't done that yet because the craziness you're feeling now will be infinitely worse, I can't describe it.  Maybe try to get therapy before he gets there or finds these forums or help for people who have "bpd" partners.  My biggest mistake ever, by the way, was admitting to being BPD (I do believe I am, but never should have been open about it).  I strongly believe it will only ever be used as a weapon against you.  Don't admit to it, ever, if you haven't already.  Just secretly go get help.
mommywantstodie	First of all, I must have read this reply 5 times in a row, and it brought me to tears.  Thank you for responding, honestly you have no idea how much it means to me.  Secondly, of course what you say is sound and rational.  However, I cannot win the battle with my brain on the following topics:   * That ending this is wrong, especially since I am on the brink of medication and therapy, combined with the fact that he was the love of my life, no doubt.  I feel 100% certain I will not be able to love someone as much, I never did with anyone else.  * That while I can understand the viewpoint, "he's not the father", it still feels, on the ranking of what you can do to another person, one of the most evil and heartless things in the entire world.  Like if you were to put together a list of things of what makes an actual "bad", immoral person, this seems like it would be somewhere on the list.  I cannot get to a point in my mind where I feel like that is excusable, to go no contact to little kids?  He KNOWS he would be seeing them at the office at some point, easily?  We live in a small city, it's so easy to run into people.  I work at the same fucking office still.  The kids will only learn from this, when I tell them, that another person doesn't love mommy.  What good is that?  And I really don't deserve to be loved or shown any compassion?  How can that be?  He told me he would always be there for us, he told me my kids were like his own, he told me he would NEVER desert us.  Now all of that means nothing?  It was pure bullshit?  Now I've learned I can never trust another man, because no matter how strongly they feel or how much bullshit they tell you to make you feel safe, there is always a risk of them just pulling away and disappearing?  Just wtf!? So not only has he ruined my life for the moment, he's ruined my impression of men for all times.  I can never trust anyone again.  * He already knows that this has destroyed me, he knows that it makes me unable to eat, have horrible psychotic breakdowns, panic to no end.  He's done this kind of thing probably 15 times throughout the relationship.  This is the longest.  And I'm no no longer able to go into work, I am so physically ill, I haven't been back for two weeks now.  He knows this affects the children.  He knows I am ENTIRELY alone in this with no friends and obviously incapable of socializing normally at the moment, or in general.  He knows how hard it is to be a single mom, and with this on top?  It's like quite literally torturing someone.  And this is someone you loved and you spent every single day with for years?  Both obsessing over each other?  It is sick, it feels pure EVIL.  When he doesn't block me?  Things are FINE.  Things are OK.  Once in a while I"ll get emotional, and then he uses it as his way out every time.  And meanwhile, he is able to cope absolutely fine.  He posts daily on facebook, peacocking and showing off, for some reason is totally changing his style to some ridiculous thing, making hurtful posts where he's shirtless and sitting in other girls laps - things he would have literally decapitated me for if I ever did them in the relationship.  He's going out or staying late at the office daily, socializing, and acting as if he never knew me.  It's monstrous, I don't know what else to call it.  Meanwhile I have been loyal to him ever since the breakup, realizing it was a mistake immediately and apologizing and trying to work on myself.    I just feel like all of these things, no contact, leaving children, ditching someone who has an "illness" and who is trying really hard to fix herself - it's inhumane.  As far as horrible things in the human experience go, this is one of the worst and most unforgivable things you can do to another person.  It shouldn't be OK.  It shouldn't be, "well, that's just his way of dealing with it", or "it's normal, guys do that".  It shouldn't.  I feel like he is stabbing me over and over again, every single morning when I wake up it restarts, it's not getting better, it's getting worse, it's the most pain I have ever experienced.  I wish to god he would have killed me during the relationship.  Too bad the glass he threw at my head didn't slice my jugular.  Oh I'm just rambling with tears down my face.  It doesn't matter.   Thanks for your response, really.  
mommywantstodie	How am I totally alone in this.
mommywantstodie	How to stop obsessing after no contact? | Does anyone have any tips?  Mind tricks?  Anything?    I am so desperate.  This wasn't just a boyfriend.  This is the one I know I should have treasured and will pay for it the rest of my life.  The love of my life, the one I know for a fact I will never be able to replace.  I will never be so attracted to someone - it took me 28 years to find him and it was intoxicating.  His eyes were so amazing, he was so different and amazing, we had an instant super strong connection just after looking at each other.  His smell, every single imperfection, I had no idea this kind of love existed.  And he felt the same.  Blah, here I go again, endless spiral of regret in this situation.  But again, he isn't like any of my other boyfriends.    I am in so much horrible pain.  I know the "horrible" part of that is the BPD, it feels ten times stronger than it probably should.  But I won't start medication until next week, and this is endless, horrible pain, in the bottom of my stomach, from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to bed.  I am so desperate for the pain to go away I am taking random pills, drinking myself into a coma every night.  I just want it to go away.    The worst part about this is that I am a single mom.  I am trying so desperately to not let this affect them, but it's impossible.   I don't have enough control over my brain.  I can't get it together no matter what I tell myself.  I am literally unable to eat, the food won't stay down.  I don't have a single person to talk to about this.  I am totally alone.  I hate myself.    
mommywantstodie	Thanks for taking the time to write this, you are right.  I at least need to get to next week so I can numb myself with medication.  It seems so stupid to be so completely out of control and miserable for this.  I should be stronger.  And I guess time heals all, even for us bpd.  I hope.  I'm sorry you're going through this too.  Thanks again for your help.
mommywantstodie	This is so nice to read. I'm going to get better. I hope I have this kind of happy story in my future with my ex.
mommywantstodie	Only was describing the pain, I didn't say he owed me anything.  I hate it, I don't want it, but yeah, of course he is his own person and can do whatever he wants.
mommywantstodie	Interesting that you could pick all that up from my description so far.  I really hate to paint myself as a victim in this situation, especially after realizing the BPD thing a few months ago.  I think there is no doubt that I've hurt him very badly over and over again from the beginning of the relationship, mostly without really realizing or believing it.  I think his mechanism to protect himself has always been to go silent.  But it does indeed feel very abusive, always has.    I've been in two other long relationships (both 4+ years) and done some dating, and I just cannot tell you how different this relationship was from those experiences.  I NEVER reacted the way I do now towards any other person, and the main thing is these cut offs from him, they make me go absolutely bezerk.  I can't tell you how many times I spent a few days or even a week curled up in a ball, literally sick to my stomach and unable to eat, unable to work, because of his silences or cut offs or threat of breaking up.  I have never loved someone so much either.  In the past I was always the one in control of my relationships, always the one to fall out of love and end them, and this one is totally different.  We were really, really extreme, all the time, bad and good.  My suspicion is that he was the love of my life, but also that we are some toxic personality combination for sure, like BPD and narcissist or BPD and BPD.  I continue to have hope because I love him so much, because so many things about our relationship was just magical, but mainly because I did figure out I have BPD (with his help).  I think of it like, at least one of us has the power to change.  Unfortunately he pretty much denies or refuses to acknowledge any issue on his end.  Sometimes he says he has "issues" too, but that's about as far as we'll ever get with it.  Never would he dig into it, go to a psychologist himself.  My bringing it up in certain circumstances triggers very strong reactions from him, accusations that I am trying to take away the blame from my side, and sometimes going totally cold.  He usually just tells me to focus on myself, and basically how "dare I" point out anything bad about him, until I'm fixed, because clearly it's mainly me.  It's so frustrating.  But I can tell his ego just cannot take hits, he protects it with his life.  I'm even willing to take more of the blame, as I can see what I did wrong so clearly, but he won't take steps with me.  And I even became fine with that over time.  I don't need him to change.  But now I've gotten the boot to the face and I'm just totally on my own to solve everything myself.  :(
mommywantstodie	I do suspect that he started something up with someone finally.  But then that isn't a totally new assumption by me.  But I think that's the only situation which would cause him really go full block; because whatever emotional thing I filled up for him is filled up by someone else.    But yeah, it's more of a vent.  It's just so painful and I feel like human garbage.  Not looking for who is right in the situation.
mommywantstodie	Awesome, I no longer exist. | My ex-boyfriend decided to follow the "no contact" advice, after I said something hurtful a couple weeks ago.  He's done this kind of thing over and over and over again throughout our relationship any time he really needed to make a point, but this is probably the longest one.  It's also combined with a new "I don't want to try anymore".  Every time it feels god awful, but I think this might be the worst.  No it's not.  But in the moment it is.    I see this advice everywhere, for dealing with "us" borderlines.  It is so frustrating.  Seems like the weakest way out.  Just a blanket approach, which is incredibly severe (to me feels a bit like getting a bullet to the head), and he doesn't take into consideration a single detail of our relationship, my current willingness, openness and progress in working on my emotions.  He doesn't even consider young kids that are affected by this, that we work together.  Nothing.    His complaint is that I'm swinging all the time and he can't handle it anymore.  He decided to more or less swallow all his emotions and hide them from me since we broke up in February, seemingly waiting for me to be "fixed" until he would try again.  Since Feb there has also been intermittent blocks or no contact or ignoring, which always cause me extreme panic and huge emotional swings, since I have basically zero information from the person that means the most to me.  (Not so suprinsingly) my brain just goes haywire, bouncing all over the place in the dark he puts me in, trying to find answers, find peace with his decision, or fight it like mad.  And then I get accused of being too emotional.    The last 7 months since we broke up have been by far the most emotional time for me in the entire 4 years I've known him.  The swings are clearly worse now that we aren't together, and since he won't open up emotionally, our entire communication the last 7 months has been essentially just swings.  And now he decides to go no contact for weeks based on a pile up of this.  It's not who I am.  It's not who we were.  When we broke up, I was clearly a mess for a few months and I have progressed so much to even get to the point that I see this diagnosis.  I'm literally a week or less away from starting medication and heavy therapy.  All of it was for him.  :(  All of it came from learning from our relationship and learning how I hurt him.  Yes, I wasn't fixed yet.  But I am so close to improving.  And I'm also in a situation where I am prone to huge panic constantly, yet I'm judged the harshest on this point in my life, and it is what he uses to decide he doesn't want to be with me anymore.  I don't get it.   
mommywantstodie	Really depends.  I have definitely had moments of extremely inappropriate laughter at times when people were hurting the most, breaking down or extremely angry.  I think for me it was more out of utter confusion at the time, which for some reason resulted in laughing.  I am not sure this is a sign of BPD, but maybe.  I will watch out for the next situation I'm in like that and try to pay attention to it.  
mommywantstodie	I was abandoned by all my friends and essentially my entire grade in 6th grade, around 11-12 years old.  It feels kind of silly to talk about when I see the other horror stories of abandonment here, but it's the only thing I can trace back to.  I shaved my head on a dare on the summer before 6th grade started, and from then on lost literally every friend, was ridiculed relentlessly, called cancer girl and gay and a boy what felt like every day.  I couldn't come back to school at all the following year.  I guess it had some kind of impact.  I lashed out for years afterwards and I think my parents didn't understand.  Having arguments with them now, I start to wonder if I felt totally abandoned emotionally by them back then as well.  I didn't relate the two until recently.
mommywantstodie	Maybe this will help, I'm reading it now:  https://mental-health-matters.com/borderline-personality-disorder-and-the-question-who-am-i/
mommywantstodie	If my ex partner who I still actively talk to would just say, "I hear you, and it's going to be OK.  I'm here.  We're going to get through this together." instead of respond with countless reasons and excuses and never really hearing me.  I guess if anyone in my family said that or had that kind of investment in me, it would mean a hell of a lot.
mommywantstodie	I do this too.  I always say, "I'm an open book to everyone".  At the same time it's kind of rare that I like anyone enough to put the energy into sitting and talking with them, but I also think the fact that I put so much energy and openness into it from the beginning makes me avoid the act all together.  I'm always seeking deep relationships, never shallow ones.  And here I am all alone.
mommywantstodie	It's so embarrassing.  I delete my FB and/or Instagram somewhere around every month, and sometimes several times in a week, because I can't bear seeing my ex boyfriend's activity.  Even just a picture of him hanging out with friends while he knows I'm miserable makes me get into the very worst of my hateful spirals.  Then I'll get calm again, and want to portray that sense of calm to people I know, feel certain I'll never do that again, and then bam.
mommywantstodie	My real "self" is chaotic.  My inside externalized is usually in extremes, and unless that's being validated by someone showing love to me, it's mostly negative.  In the rare times throughout my life when I've shown that to someone and really open up, it's can be wonderful and amazing or in my last relationship - like a drug, until the hate from me becomes overwhelming to that person and paints everything black.  My fake "self", the one I try to make new friends with, or use at work, or in any situations where I can't act out and be extreme, that one is completely lost.  That's supposed to be the average or calm personality.  I have no idea what that really looks like and rarely feel it, so I simply mimic whoever I'm around.  Inside I am a frantic mess until I can drown it out with alcohol or find solitude again.  When it comes to parenting, I also feel like I have no barometer, no internal guide, no strongstanding values or morals.  I always try to do my best but I constantly change, depending on who is my mentor or idol for the day, or depending on something I read and feel strongly about for an hour.  Completely inconsistent and ever changing.    I'm also ADHD and horribly forgetful, so that probably has something to do with it.    The confident side of my personality and things related to how I feel about my appearance?  I literally can look in the mirror one hour and feel sexy and gorgeous, and one hour later look in the mirror and, honest to god, feel as the ugliest person alive.  It is brutal.  That is getting more frequent and weird.  My mom told me this week she always thought I had multiple personalities.  I am guessing she is not the only one who felt that way.    
mommywantstodie	I'm on holiday with my family for a month, I get my kids tomorrow.  There is zero chance I'll be going to the ER.  I'm not going to kill myself while I'm here.  Like I said, I have treatment coming back home in Europe. Thanks for your message.
QTPN	Having second thoughts | So, i just lot a few shipments of things that i earn my life with.  Yesterday i ordered some heroine to od because i literally have no money, no education, skills, family or anything.   But today im not so sure, i don't really want to die but just to vanish. Im also really lazy to die or do anything   i dont really know what to write
QTPN	Sorry, i copypasted another post to use the format and forgot to edit the last line.

QTPN	Donde buscar ayuda psicologica en Buenos aires? | Tengo este amigo que esta muy deprimido, cuando nos juntamos la caretea realativamente bien aunque nunca quiere hacer nada fuera de tomar o charlar y ultimamente estuvo regalando bastantes cosas suyas lo que hizo que me preocupe un toque bastante.   Tanto él como yo somos mas bien pobres, llego a fin de mes con suerte y él vive con su vieja todavía. creo que tiene 22 o 23 años asi que no sé realmente que hacer.  
QTPN	Por eso pedí recomendaciones, había leido de eso pero no se que hacer AAAAAA 
QTPN	Igual me causa curiosidad por que directamente al psiquiatra. Creí que el psicologo tenía que derivar o algo así. 
QTPN	Can you wash ketamine? | I meant in the same way you wash the coke or something, i ordered a bunch and i don't know how pure it is tbh. 
QTPN	Vi que cerca de nuestro barrio hay hospitales con guardia psiquiatrica, sirve eso en ultima instancia o asi?  No tiene obra social ni prepaga, no trabaja y la familia lo tiene ahí como la borde. 
QTPN	With low profile i meant the kind of drugs that dogs are not trained to search for. Ketamine, RCs and stuffs.   But im assuming that Amazon have police dogs because im dumb as fuck 
QTPN	I ordered untracked before and i got it in three-four weeks too.   Maybe it has something to do with the hurricane and stuffs, i don't really know. Did you try messaging gg? 
QTPN	For this one, yes, i needed it ASAP so i didn't really mind the signature and stuffs.  The next two are without tracking

QTPN	No encuentro donde dice que sea un mapa de la ciudad. 
QTPN	I see this working with LSD and other low profile drugs. Hidden in books as pages or inside toys.  
QTPN	No, im not. And living this far has the pro of having to wait 2-3 weeks minimum to get another order.   Also the heroin i had was a godsend when managing the comedown of the coke. 
QTPN	Heroin int? | [removed]
QTPN	i meant the price.   It was international, im not in the us. 
QTPN	It was about 50 for 1,5g if i remember correctly and it was international.
QTPN	I searched but didnt find anything.  I bought from him and not a trusted vendor because i don't really mind if it doesnt show up, i'll still do awash and probably end up with half the order if anything, but i was asking if anyone has already ordered from him and idk.
QTPN	Nah, is just that it was also cheap and idk. I just want info on him.
QTPN	DutchBest on TradeRoute? | I was thinking about buying some K and i found a listing that has a "Special offer" of 2 free XTC pills for every 1g+ order.  
Verbalatyx	My job makes me want to die?? | I hope this is an appropriate place to put this, I haven't used reddit before this but a lot of people suggested it to me. Some backstory to this, it's probably gonna be kind of long. I'm 24 and I've been working the same job for 5 years, at a pretty large place. I tried going to college but for a few reasons (anxiety/depression, money, unsure of what I want to do) I ended up dropping out.  I'm also a queer person, and a few years ago came out to my friends and family as a nonbinary trans man.  In general, my depression and anxiety and other issues have been mostly kept in check. I regularly go to therapy and I'm not on any medications (that might change soon) but my biggest problem is that whenever I'm at work I want to kill myself.  I want to say that it didn't start out this way but that's a lie. I've cried at work at least once a week since I started. My co-workers, while generally okay people, are very ignorant. They constantly throw around slurs and speak about gay and trans people in ways that are very inappropriate and upsetting (especially for a business that totes itself as being very diverse and safe). My managers do not care. I tried to report sexual harassment once and was told not to gossip, which lead me to feel that harassment is not taken seriously  (other coworkers have had similar experences). I feel very unsafe at work. I'm constantly missgendered, and even though I would like to pursue my transition I don't feel that I will every be able to do that. A lot of the people I work with are people who started at this job young and they have worked her for 10+ years and who also hate their jobs. Most people here hate their jobs. The longer I work her the more restrictions they put on us. I could write a novel about the stuff that goes down at my job.  The other problem I'm having is that I have to work on my feet all day. I have sciatica and by the time I'm done with my shift I'm in so much pain I can hardly do anything.  I have plans for my future and people I love but every day I am here I want to die. I have a hard time doing my work because I have to run to the bathroom constantly because I can't stop crying and having panic attacks. I know the obvious answer is to find a diffrent job, but this job has "good benifits" and pays $16 dollars and hour. Every job I've applied for I don't hear back from because either I don't have a college education or I don't have the right experience. I don't know why I'm turning here, maybe I just feel like I need someone to talk to. Maybe someone here has some suggestions or can help me? Tldr; my job makes me want to kill myself but I don't know what my other options are. Thank you for reading
Verbalatyx	Ah, I probably should be less vague about my workplace, I work for a hospital so it's a very big hospital but one that doesn't have other locations
Verbalatyx	I think the biggest part of it is just that the environment is very toxic. I work with people who act like they never left high school. I feel like no matter where I work, I'll probably have to deal with ignorance, I just wish that I felt like I had some protection from it? Like my employers constantly talks about how amazing and diverse they are, but also harassment isn't taken seriously  and that's the part that makes it more difficult. I'm nervous that if I speak up I will end up reprimanded or something. I probably will end up looking for any trans support groups that I can though.
gagmewithyourtruth	I'm giving myself six months | If I can't find happiness or improve my life in some fashion or form, I'm going to kill myself.   There's no reason for me to live if my life is punctuated by mediocrity and being alone.   I feel as though I may be forced to see others succeed but never achieve success that I can hope for. It's time to literally do or die.   I've been praying for death lately as it seems to be a warm inviting blanket welcoming me into a comfort of nothingness.  I've grown tired of living and if I can't make a change, it's off to the gallows for me. 
gagmewithyourtruth	Omg I love triple X tenticrule 
gagmewithyourtruth	Hasty generalization.   If you don't want people doing that to you don't do it to other people but otherwise shut your mouth.
gagmewithyourtruth	https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/mobile/psychologists.htm  The United States my friend. 32,000 over ten years is a big number. In the united States, we don't have a national healthcare system that caps growth rates on psychologists. Funding of psychologists varies based on what type of psychologist the person is.   Research psychologists are funded through government grants   Clinical psychologists are paid through the public or private company they work for.   Counselors and the like usually work in practices across the united States, the majority are privately owned.   Sorry about the NHS boo. Sucks to suck
gagmewithyourtruth	Maybe in the UK, which I'm assuming you're from. Sorry bub but it doesn't work like that in the rest of the world. It's a much more different landscape for psychologists in the U.S.    Or did you assume it was the same?
gagmewithyourtruth	What are your sources on this?  And if you decide to not be lazy and actually conduct some research. Psychologists ARE NOT people with bachelors degrees in psychology. You have to have a master's degree and above to actually have a substantial career in psychology.  I find it sad that people constantly prop up half truths and generalizations to make a point they most likey don't know too much about. 
gagmewithyourtruth	You know if everyone is a bad driver everywhere you go then I don't think the problem is them.
gagmewithyourtruth	Oh you know most of those psych majors only have bachelor's degrees and you actually need a master's or above to be considered a psychologist. Not to mention there's many fields in the psychology field that are still growing, like gerontology.   But then again I don't expect you to know that because you didnt cite any sources nor go into detail about which levels of psychology degrees were in surplus.

gagmewithyourtruth	The two aren't mutually exclusive. You can personally hate being treated as an object but then objectify others. It's not that hard. It happens to you so you do it to other people, simple cycle.   Congratulations on taking care of your body! Would you like a medal? Millions of others do what you do everyday, it's not a super special thing.   Now you could argue that I'm a degenerate idiot for not taking care of my body but I'll say is depression is a bitch and injuring your back sucks. Excuses I know but at least now I'm going to get the body I want. You have to leave the past in the past and look forward to the future.   I'm not shaming you for having a preference, we ALL have preferences. Everyone. I'm just saying BASED ON WHAT I SEE, I even clarifed that. If you're not a shallow bitch who treats people less fit than you as the scum of the earth then it'll show.   You're not my type usually works great. I use it all of the time
gagmewithyourtruth	Thanks for the advice. It's always appreciated. You're an awesome person for that 
gagmewithyourtruth	Oh I've got a long way to go Henny, and thanks for the encouragement.   Everyone has the right to turn down anyone they want based on anything. It's futile to get mad at someone because they rejected you. And if you really can't get rid of the anger, use it to make a better self. But when you're rude about turning someone down there in lies a problem, not with your preference, but with your common courtesy.   I'd also like to personally apologize for being crass with my comment toward you. In learning to assert myself I sometimes go a bit overboard. You're point is completely valid and I respect it and you.  We will be two fit hoes
gagmewithyourtruth	It's nice that you do, and appreciated, but I want to be able to hike 6-7 miles again. I want to be able to walk up a flight of stairs and not get winded. I want my abs to show again and uncover my naturally muscular body.   Being fat isn't something I enjoy. And if guys don't like the fact I'm losing weight then screw them. They should like me for me, not just because I'm a specific weight. I am not a sexual object for men, I'm not losing weight specifically for men to like me. I want to be fit and healthy. 
gagmewithyourtruth	I love God on tricycle 
gagmewithyourtruth	Hot
gagmewithyourtruth	Dusty old bones, full of green study
gagmewithyourtruth	Then why are you here bitch boy?
gagmewithyourtruth	Is that the current system we live in though? Why are you bringing something up that has no practical value in the present? That's so confusing to me.
gagmewithyourtruth	I don't think you're getting my point 
justoutofview	It was with one therapy place that had a rotation of people padding their resumes tbh. You're right about finding someone good who will listen though its hard.  I don't really have any friends to get cannabis. Antidepressants had no effect. So far I've just been drinking (as minimally as possible) to help cope.  Do you think drugs might help?  Thank you for replying btw
justoutofview	That job could be a ticket out of state.   Try not to think of it as below you, times can be tough for the best of us. There's no shame in being pragmatic and doing what you need to do to get by.
justoutofview	You have the right to feel how you feel, /u/HoboWithAGlock. You don't have to qualify or justify it for the people who might try guilt you.  Good luck on your interview tomorrow, Im rooting for you.
justoutofview	Almost 3000 days of hoping and counting.
justoutofview	I tried but stopped going because they changed who you talked to every week or two.   Made it very tiring to explain myself and very hard to trust them. :/
justoutofview	Yep, just standing and thinking.
justoutofview	It didn't get better | 8 years and the depression and loneliness has only gotten progressively worse.  Sometimes I'll have really brief periods of feeling normalness and when it crashes I feel like I've been delusional and losing touch with reality.  How do you deal with it? :(
justoutofview	Cup of T
justoutofview	Hey, late response but I just finished accutane and it had no effects on hrt.  /r/accutane and /r/skincareaddiction help too.
justoutofview	Don't you just hate those late night waves of nihilism and emptiness? | 
justoutofview	No, but alone at night is when it's worst.
justoutofview	It's gotten to the point where I just leave my phone on silent since I know the only messages I'll get are bills, spam or update notifications.
justoutofview	Upsettingly relatable. :(
KHVWasteOfALife	[Serious] The people who got plastic surgery and were successfully able to go from ugly to semi-attractive, how did your life change? | [removed]
KHVWasteOfALife	Its very rare to be super attractive from plastic surgery. But I've seen a couple examples where people do in fact become semi attractive. Its kinda like "plugging up a hole in a tire."  You have good results, but you're not the same as being an immaculate tire.
KHVWasteOfALife	I wish I was ok, man. :'(  Yeah maybe music will help. Personality doesn't really help.
KHVWasteOfALife	[Serious] Ugly people: How do you cope with being ugly? Also, do you agree that instead of teaching the "everybody is beautiful" meme, the "its ok to be ugly" narrative should be taught from a young age? Why do average looking or attractive people hate on ugly people complaining about our struggles? | 
KHVWasteOfALife	There you go. Maybe I should seriously consider it.
KHVWasteOfALife	I've already gotten feedback on /r/amiugly.
KHVWasteOfALife	lol
KHVWasteOfALife	Good.
KHVWasteOfALife	Can you stop with the "everyone will be ugly" crap?  Some things can be enjoyed the most only during a window of time the most. Just how things you would do as a 5 year old would be fun then, sex and love life is supposed to be amazing in your 20s.  Lol, I can't date.   >Looks alone are such an incredibly tiny fraction of the world and the human experience. People look for character and someone to share a life with, not a static object to look at. Focus on the parts of you that you can better. If you have decided that your external attractiveness is not fixable, overcome in other aspects.  No, that applies to friendships.
KHVWasteOfALife	As friends or romantic partners?
KHVWasteOfALife	I'm pretty sure face matters a lot, mostly...
KHVWasteOfALife	I need a lot of surgeries, lmfao.
KHVWasteOfALife	I should.
KHVWasteOfALife	I don't get shit comments because I'm tall, I guess. 6'4" level tall. 
KHVWasteOfALife	>sideways noses  Wut?
KHVWasteOfALife	Ah, all the fucking dumbasses here assume that I haven't tried all I could.  If I tried and nothing worked, why the fuck would I look into plastic surgery?  Changing up hair etc doesn't fix a shit face.
KHVWasteOfALife	IKR!
KHVWasteOfALife	Yeah, its a good thing.
KHVWasteOfALife	lol
KHVWasteOfALife	And what would that do? Find a woman who will date me just because of my money and wait for me to be dead so she can take all of it or something else?
KHVWasteOfALife	Lol.
KHVWasteOfALife	Not like optimism helps either.
KHVWasteOfALife	Its not like my behavior will change things again.  >It sounds like all you do is make excuses about everything  "Excuses" assume that this is a just world. Its not. Looks are everything for dating and relationships.
KHVWasteOfALife	Yay! Hopefully I can have some good changes too lol.
KHVWasteOfALife	> It was like a window into the good life of an attractive person.  Until we take our masks off :'(
KHVWasteOfALife	Why?
KHVWasteOfALife	That doesn't change it either. But then again, nothing will change my problems.
KHVWasteOfALife	Lol. If there was a possibility of finding them.
KHVWasteOfALife	Change what? My entire face? How?
KHVWasteOfALife	I'm just demotivated towards doing anything | I hate life. I'm fucking tired of life and living. I feel like there is nothing that makes me happy.  I don't have friends (well I do, but I'm a social outcast) and I'm too ugly to date. I'm just tired of things.  I don't like spending time with friends. I'm tired of being the lone wolf. The kissless, handholdless, virgin.  I'm tired of hearing the "be yourself" crap. Personality doesn't make for being ugly. Ever.  I just wish I wasn't born in the first place.  Oh, don't give me the "I'm sure you're not ugly." Do you even know me? I'm ugly.  The only thing I care about is having a partner who finds me worth of dating and where I'm worthy of having sex with.  I'll never experience that. Ever. For my entire life.  Even if I find a hooker, I'll never be worthy of actually being loved. I know she'll just be in for the money and then want to be out of it ASAP.  I've had dreams of going on a date, holding hands with a girl who I love and who loves me back. I was in bliss during those times and them woke up and realized how much of it was false and then cried and cried before jumping in the shower to go to work.
KHVWasteOfALife	What can I offer? I can make money and have some talents. But in a romantic relationship, being able to sexually satisfy a partner is also needed and always has precedence.
KHVWasteOfALife	>have you ever tried dating a blind girl  Lol. (not looking down on blind people, but your suggestion is... interesting.)
KHVWasteOfALife	Its hard to find such people. I don't really care too much personally. I've asked 9 women in my life ranging from unattractive to attractive. Doesn't work.
KHVWasteOfALife	I will. But mark my words. I'd get rejected by all of them.  Sigh...
KHVWasteOfALife	You are implying that social skills are my problem. Social skills don't matter when you're ugly.
KHVWasteOfALife	Eh, I'm 26. So yeah, most than half of my 20s are over already, lol. Its hard, dude. For both of us.
KHVWasteOfALife	Background:  I hate life. I'm fucking tired of life and living. I feel like there is nothing that makes me happy.  I don't have friends (well I do, but I'm a social outcast) and I'm too ugly to date. I'm just tired of things.  I don't like spending time with friends. I'm tired of being the lone wolf. The kissless, handholdless, virgin.  I'm tired of hearing the "be yourself" crap. Personality doesn't make for being ugly. Ever.  I just wish I wasn't born in the first place.  Oh, don't give me the "I'm sure you're not ugly." Do you even know me? I'm ugly.

I've had dreams of going on a date, holding hands with a girl who I love and who loves me back. I was in bliss during those times and them woke up and realized how much of it was false and then cried and cried before jumping in the shower to go to work.  People keep saying, "its going to get better." I'm 26. Its not gonna change. I know. Its only going to go downhill from here. If anything its going to get worse. I'll be older and uglier as things go. You can't change shit bone structure.  I'll be even more distant from my friends. Some of them are starting to get married. Many of them will probably have kids in their 30s. I'll be even more of an outcast as I approach my 30s.
KHVWasteOfALife	I haven't even held a girl's hand.
KHVWasteOfALife	> If the only thing you cared about is having a partner, and you have a general sense of how one might get one, why not go out there and do what you have in mind? >   I have a general sense of how to do that. I'm helpless.  People act like dating is all merit. None of it is. Its all genetics and the luck of the draw.  >Now you might argue that you don't want to but if you really wanted to have a partner and what you know about how you might get one is correct, not wanting to try indicates a conflict of interests.  >I have this abstract sense that if you want to obtain something of value like a partner or a skill, somethiing of value has to be given up / invested like time and energy.  Its not a skill. Its luck.
KHVWasteOfALife	I'm Just Demotivated Towards Doing Anything | I hate life. I'm fucking tired of life and living. I feel like there is nothing that makes me happy.  I don't have friends (well I do, but I'm a social outcast) and I'm too ugly to date. I'm just tired of things.  I don't like spending time with friends. I'm tired of being the lone wolf.

KHVWasteOfALife	Looks fade, but that's not the point. Priorities change. Just like how babies enjoy some things at some point in life, good looking people in their 20s enjoy the sexcapades part of life too with the ugly folks looking in envy.
KHVWasteOfALife	So how would it help in dating? You tell me.
KHVWasteOfALife	Same.  These attractive fuckers will say, "depression? Why don't you see a therapist? Maybe chemical imbalances are fucking things up?"  These fuckers don't understand the imbalances caused by not being loved. Having a relationship, a cuddle, a kiss, having sex, etc are all things that give that fulfillment in life.  Some people are barred from that shit because of fucking genetics.  People act like dating is all merit. None of it is merit. Its all luck. Its all genetics. And its all looks.
KHVWasteOfALife	I wish dude. I guess you're a one off example.
KHVWasteOfALife	Its not like being optimistic will change dating. Optimism doesn't do shit. Being good looking does.
KHVWasteOfALife	Ugh I wish guys had makeup as an option...  Everything that makes us attractive is based off hard bone tissue.
KHVWasteOfALife	How can't I?
KHVWasteOfALife	I'm white. I am pale, but still. My facial bone structure is shit. I've done everything I could hair, clothing, etc wise.  I could try bulking. I'm tall. 6'4" to be exact. But the problem is that girls like tall, ATTRACTIVE guys. Not ugly motherfuckers like myself. I am a fucking ogre that can be spotted from afar.
KHVWasteOfALife	> It just seems that way, but trust me, it is only a band aid, it cures the loneliness and that sounds like a trigger of yours...but once they get in, they can flip that switch and fuck you up, or they could leave you and that will realy fuck you up. >   No dude.
KHVWasteOfALife	You get your cards reset for another game. I'm stuck with a hand forever.  >Lots of attractive or semi-attractive people suck at dating.   Sorry, but no. That is rare. They will at least have one relationship in their life.  >If an attractive guy came up to me and said something offensive and stupid I wouldn't date just because he's good-looking. Most people...okay some people, have more sense than that.  IDK but all the studies have shown otherwise. In fact, people have more tolerance when you're good looking for saying and doing stupid shit.
KHVWasteOfALife	Yeah
KHVWasteOfALife	Satirical?
KHVWasteOfALife	How would it be "harmful."  I'd love to look like a different person. Fuck my reality.
KHVWasteOfALife	No, but I'm ugly though. My hardware is average and I'm 6'4". But the latter doesn't help since I'm ugly.  I'm pretty sure you're average?
KHVWasteOfALife	> Hey man, I'm in your boat and I don't fucking care anymore. It'll be a hard tie to cut, but once you do it, you can focus on other things in life. Sometimes you just gotta accept "that awesome thing that everyone takes for granted... not for me." Tough, but necessary. >   It really is tough. I hate those people who take it for granted. There are guys and girls who say, "I have these ten guys/girls who I've matched with but don't know who I should go on a date with."  Its needed for sure. My best friend told me that the best thing I can do is move on and work towards being rich and famous to the best of my ability. Maybe when I'm 40, I can break these shackles.  At least men have that option. For women, when you're ugly, you can't even break those shackles.  >You're 26. I made the leap at 24. I said "I'm going to die alone so I'll live alone too." It was a bitter pill to swallow but now I see romance and sex kind of like skydiving: "ooh, that looks cool, but no biggie if I stay on the ground."  It really is. But lets be honest. Its kind of a biggie. But a biggie that we will be left away from.  >You can do it. It'll hurt, but the pain will pass and then you'll be free.  I guess I should.  >And if your friends reject you because you don't have a girlfriend... buddy you know what the advice for that is.  They don't reject me. They're good friends. But I don't "fit in." And its understandable. When they have kids, they will be talking about baby things.
KHVWasteOfALife	Absolutely. People have a high tolerance for things that attractive people do wrong.
KHVWasteOfALife	No I feel like the second two used to be important for men to date. These days, the first one is important mostly since women are financially independent.  >So my advice is just to keep trying. Don't give up after only 9 attempts. Because really, what in life can master after only 9 tries? Nothing,  That's implying that dating is a skill. Its not.
KHVWasteOfALife	I see women doing that a lot too, to be honest.
KHVWasteOfALife	I already asked out 9 women so far. Its only going to go downhill.
KHVWasteOfALife	Also, the typical "you're acting so entitled" is said a lot. Here is my take on that.  Nobody is entitled to sex and relationships. But everyone has the right to complain about it!
KHVWasteOfALife	I've done that. Tried that. That builds good friendships. But not romantic partners.  Lets be real. The only main differentiator between romantic and non-romantic relationships is sex. USUALLY. A lot of quality relationships that exist are with people who enjoy each other's company and are almost like best friends who they have sex with.  But when you're downright unattractive, the two don't seem to want to come together to that level.  That's understandable. At least a small bit of physical attraction needs to come. Otherwise you have situations where the man can't get an erection and the woman can't get wet. 
KHVWasteOfALife	The only self improvement I can go with is plastic surgery. And even that doesn't work always.
KHVWasteOfALife	How can ugly people accept things that way? Are you ugly, btw?
KHVWasteOfALife	A human being (woman) who also wants the same thing?  Ideally, a person who I find physically attractive. But I'm at the point where I don't really care that much anymore about that too much.
KHVWasteOfALife	> I am a lot like you, only older. I have always suffered from chronic depression, I got scars on my wrists to prove (and even scars that go upward) I still suffer from it, I will always suffer from it. >   :(  >Let me be frank with you, women will fuck you up. The wrong one could end you. You may not see it right now, you probably need to experience it, but there is no worse pain then being in love with someone and for that someone to attack your weakness.  Its not women. Its nature. I'm not going to blame women. Just like how I have the desire to want to date someone hot, why don't they?  >Relationships, cuddling, kissing, sex, all these things are a direct tunnel to you, they will lower your walls and your defenses, you need to be prepared to handle it.  I guess so.  >My suggestion to you, and it is something i wish i would of done, take your time with it. Maybe it takes you ten more years to find someone, but that someone should understand your depression and not use it against you.  I don't know, man.  >Women, or i should say, girls, your age can be very fucking selfish. Find a mature older lady, trust me, they are the best. They are empathetic, understanding, patient, and often a good cook. If you find one that has children then you are golden.   I could. Without a doubt. But a lot of them have kids etc. I don't know if I want to raise someone else's kids for one. But I guess beggers can't be choosers. Fucking sucks though.  >A girlfriend is not the cure, it will seem like it at first, but that in love feeling goes away, and that void inside comes back.  No a gf is the cure.  >Be patient, but more to that, work on your depression, work on yourself. The way i fight my depression is to always be honest with myself, both good and bad...I find that if I am honest about my bad stuff, then i can be honest about my good stuff, and then i realize I am just a person like everyone else, there is nothing inherently wrong with me, at least not anymore then anyone else.   There is no way to fight it. I know I'm going to be stuck with it for life.  >Let me say this, if you meet a girl that thinks that way, you dont fucking want her. She will drop your guard, and then she will fuck you up. Be picky about the women you want to be with, dont fall for the nice ass or big tits or big eyes, find someone who can look inside you and see that you can feel a depth of emotional pain very very few people endure. Find a women that knows that every day you wake up, you are brave for facing that day. Also though, dont use your depression to control a women, it is a easy trap to fall into but it will destroy a relationship.  I can't be picky, lol. Looks or personality wise. I've asked out 9 women in my life ranging from different attractiveness levels. I'm nobody's type.  >Just always remember, you are a individual and you deserve respect from everyone around you. You are not broken, and even if you think you are ugly, even if you are truly considered "ugly" you are still a person, you still have feelings, and you deserve respect, start with yourself, respect yourself first and once you do that, you can start demanding respect with other people  I'm a person. But a pathetic waste of a life biologically speaking.
KHVWasteOfALife	Jesus. I'm 26 and am worried that I'll be that. :(
KHVWasteOfALife	It rarely happens. You can't take a small sample size and say it will work out. A lot of people end up alone and miserable. 
KHVWasteOfALife	Yeah, man. It fucking sucks.
KHVWasteOfALife	It is indeed. Hence why I feel like a waste of a life. It fucking sucks.
KHVWasteOfALife	Looks, Money, Status
KHVWasteOfALife	Ouch! I feel you.
KHVWasteOfALife	Yeah. Maybe it was good in the past. But not these days.
KHVWasteOfALife	Which doesn't happen. For those who want a relationship but never will get one, they don't care for other things.
KHVWasteOfALife	> The Swan  Was it effective?
KHVWasteOfALife	> Dude get in shape! Honestly its a bitch because its lots of effort but being in good shape will make it easier and give you confidence. >   What makes you think I'm fat? I'm not. My face has HORRID features.  >Some ppl like a good looking face above all else but lots of people like something else. I like ass, legs, tits and face in that order. Women are similar, some prefer toned abs, broad shoulders or big muscles etc.  Eh. I guess.  >Ultimately all of the above is just the surface, best ass I've ever seen is on a complete hell-bitch of a woman, people arent joking when the say its whats on the inside that counts.  I guess so.  >On a side note I'm not saying you have to become a fitness model, people who already know you will appreciate the self improvement and you will appear more attractive to them for it.  >Good luck mate.  I mean being a fitness model won't hurt, but still.
KHVWasteOfALife	People in relationships clearly take that privilege for granted.  When a relationship etc is something you will never get, that's all you care about, and you don't care about anything else. Everything else is numbingly boring.
KHVWasteOfALife	You just said that genetics helped you grow and have a better looking face...  This is the fucking just world fallacy that dating is all about effort. Its not. Your luck from this is determined when you get out of the womb.
KHVWasteOfALife	Cuddling, kisses, going out and getting ice cream and finally having sex to end the night?
KHVWasteOfALife	> OK, well if you want to post a pic here or pm one, I (and others) will give you honest feedback on you from a purely physical perspective. >   I already know. I don't want my photo accidentally going around some way. Not saying you're a bad person, but this is the internet.  >Other than that, I want you to know that I know people who are considered ugly who have been in plenty of relationships.  I've mentioned here that I've asked a women with a range of attractiveness and gotten rejection.  >And people who are average or good looking who really struggle getting dates.   I doubt it. And if they do, they are small anecdotes. The majority of the population in this, don't.  >I'm not saying this is the norm or that life isn't biased or harder on ugly people, but that I don't think you are hopeless. In all seriousness. But I also don't know that you are in a place where you can hear that. I think maybe you are just needing to vent on here (which is fine) and maybe find solidarity with others (also fine), but if you ever decide to turn your life around, I think you fully have potential to find someone who loves you.  I don't know. I think its going to go downhill from here. I'm already 26.
KHVWasteOfALife	Yes, patchy. Most guys can grow facial hair, but it doesn't turn out smooth and well.  Nah, probably not a mustache. I don't want to look like a creepy pedo.
KHVWasteOfALife	I will. I'll tell you that it won't change.  Also I'm talking about LMS data.
KHVWasteOfALife	> I have a perfect girlfriend who I love very much and idk how shes with me because shes perfect in every way. Short story, I was a loser, changed everything because I was tired of it, it took 5 years but now I walk head straight up, girls look at me a lot, my gf is jealous sometimes(makes me feel gooood hehe).   Lol, you were lucky. I'm not.  >Looks good right? Except its not, you will change yourself a bit, girls will like you, you will feel better but the scars are always there.  Boo fucking hoo. Try coming to the reality that you're fucked entirely for life.
KHVWasteOfALife	I can't really grow a beard :(
KHVWasteOfALife	>Nobody likes being rejected.   A lot of them know that there is a brighter future when trying again. I don't. :(  >Did these women tell you why they said no? Or did you assume it was because of your physical features?  Some of them did.
KHVWasteOfALife	Maybe. I'll try to cover my forehead more.  Eh, it will still be long. You can't create that "illusion."
KHVWasteOfALife	That hardly is true. I don't cold approach. You are probably referring to cold approaches. But these same people, once they have good friendships etc with women it goes well.
KHVWasteOfALife	> But you've said you're ugly, not "somewhat unattractive". There is a big difference between the two. Plus, you've only asked out 9 people, how many of those were somewhat unattractive? It sounds to me that you can't make a conclusion with so little data to base it on.  Only 3 of them were good looking. One of them being super good looking, and 2 of them being semi-attractive.  I asked out 2 average looking women and 4 unattractive women.  Lol, there is data. You can't win. This is why there are places like MGTOW, Incels, ForeverAlone, etc. The dating environment has changed a lot. Especially for unattractive men.  >Try asking out more women who are less attractive. It is a numbers game even for attractive people (though yes the odds are in their favour) so you've got strike out a few more times before you'll make a home run.  Lol, most attractive men and women don't have to go through so many numbers. The "numbers game" applying to them means asking out maybe 4-5 and getting a date.  >(not sure why I used a sports metaphor....I hate sports, lol)  lol
KHVWasteOfALife	What will optimism bring? Will it make me remotely dateable?
KHVWasteOfALife	Lol. "Personality."  Personality gets good friends. But it rarely attracts sexual partners.
KHVWasteOfALife	Lol. Looks like they are on full force downvoting us. Such wow.
KHVWasteOfALife	> Since physical attractiveness can be very subjective  That's the difference between being "super hot" to someone, but "cute" to another. When you're objectively unattractive to many, you're unattractive...  >objectively what is it about you that makes you unattractive or ugly?   I have a REALLY long midface and kinda long forehead. My eyes are bulging out. Nothing can solve my face without painfully invasive plastic surgery.  People were like, "you're tall. Find a woman who likes tall guys."  I'm 6'4", but despite the meme, women like GOOD LOOKING tall guys.  >I ask because some things have solutions, for example, if you have bad acne there are products you could use or if your hair looks weird you can get a haircut or go bald.  I've done everything I could. People assume that people are ugly because of being unkempt. I'm not unkempt.
KHVWasteOfALife	Depends on what you get.
KHVWasteOfALife	I've asked out 9 women so far in my life.  >Find a girl who can support herself?   Then why would she go with me? She has so many better options than me.  >Also, sex in a relationship is 500x freakier and more fulfilling than "sexcapades" with randoms.   I know it is. Because you actually love the person. But I can't be "loved" physically because of my looks. :(
KHVWasteOfALife	The "somewhat unattractive" women were at my facial attractiveness.
KHVWasteOfALife	>I see couples where both people are of similar attractiveness (or not) all the time.  Does it pertain to millennials? This generation does have a lot of single and unmarried people. The truth is that our parents and before that, people got into marriages due to societal expectations. 
KHVWasteOfALife	See my comment here...  https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/70hwi6/serious_ugly_people_how_do_you_cope_with_being/dn39r63/?context=3
KHVWasteOfALife	I might sound an asshole with how I say this but here is my take on this...  Its a shit feeling to know that after all the sexcapades that these people have had in their earlier days they are down to use you as a source of income for a house, etc.  I have no reason to be happy, to be honest.
KHVWasteOfALife	> OK, well I don't want to give the same advice that is everywhere, but there's more than body fat that goes into attractiveness. Do your clothes fit you well (not too loose, too tight, fall in the right places?) Do you wear colors that suit your complexion? What do you do with your hair? How do you walk/carry yourself? >   Dude. I went with one of my friends who tried to help me out and bought a good addition to my previously lackluster wardrobe. It won't cover my shit face though.  Haircut too.  Well, what do you mean by how I walk around? I'm a 6'4", lanky, permavirgin.  >Also: how are you asking women out? Are your insecurities apparent? Are you over the top sarcastic constantly? Do you maintain appropriate eye contact?  Through contacts, parties, etc. I do maintain eye contact.
KHVWasteOfALife	I should. I've done it during my college days. I should do it again.  But it won't change this aspect of my life. I'll be happy about the things I've done for them.
KHVWasteOfALife	> attractive women  Attractive men too.  Lookism is a thing without a doubt.
WoogieMaster	self
WoogieMaster	well women have it good then
WoogieMaster	I hate when people joke about depression and suicide | Lately around my school I hear a lot of jokes about this topic like "im gonna fucking kill myself if this or that", "oh help me please im chronically depressed just shot me now." Hell I overheard someone ask if chronic depression is even real right after joking about it. Sometimes I wish they really knew how horrible **any** type of depression really is.
WoogieMaster	yup, im in a good mood right now. Last time i got used to this mood I cried as I felt the feeling of being alive dragged away from me.
WoogieMaster	as someone with said fetish heres my side on it. I'm more turned on by the act of dropping the bomb, im not really turned on by shit it self
WoogieMaster	when my mother was pregnant with both my younger brother and sister she did this and it has really fucked with them.
WoogieMaster	I wish I would enjoy it all, but I'm cursed with depression so I loose sight of this most of the time. Thanks for reminding me life is still worth.
WoogieMaster	i see im not the only one with this fetish
WoogieMaster	I just happened to find the [doujin](http://www.tsumino.com/Book/Info/26376/the-big-sister-of-the-secret-shop-2-2) of this last night, now to find out if the anime version holds up
WoogieMaster	I want a girl to give *me* head pats, but giving them isnt bad either of corse
WoogieMaster	have you looked into role reversal? sounds like you'll be into if you havent 
WoogieMaster	btw if you hold the majestic great sword in you left hand, you'll get a 15% damage boost and some cool new strong attacks 
WoogieMaster	Nope, for me its basically the only time I feel somewhat alive anyway.
WoogieMaster	or three
WoogieMaster	I was gonna watch it at school, but school got canceled due to lack of glasses, and when i got home i was told my fam wasnt getting glasses. I missed the main part where it gets super bright, but I still got a look at the end. my vision is a little missed up, but i needed glasses before this anyway.
WoogieMaster	testicle torsion 
WoogieMaster	I got my 1st S rating  Edit: I also have a question. So I just did a new beat map, 1st time I got a C, but the other 3 times I got 2 As, and a B, but why is the C the highest?
WoogieMaster	Zombies, I hate it at this point
WoogieMaster	farts, ya I got a fetish
WoogieMaster	thx for this, never really thought about the Zero Days
WoogieMaster	I use a fidget spinner unironically but when hate the memes around it.
WoogieMaster	Money, but all I got was fucking clothes I forgot about right after I saw it. I just wanted to blow money on ps2 games
WoogieMaster	I agree with you, I don't know myself but after the last of us I got tired of it.   edit, I do like the last of us tho
WoogieMaster	yes
WoogieMaster	I know more Japanese culture and language than you
WoogieMaster	PS4 because anime and vr
WoogieMaster	Crowds, I hate them and they make me a nervous wreck.
WoogieMaster	Osu, but going at my own pace and I am noticing the improvements little by little.
WoogieMaster	/r/masturbation
WoogieMaster	I prefer using 2 hands, the typical 1 Hand up and down doesn't really work for me.
WoogieMaster	/r/fetish
WoogieMaster	Gud stuff
WoogieMaster	/r/kemonomimi
WoogieMaster	Yup, all I've been playing is Osu, and a bunch of other steam games I got over a month ago that I still never got around to. Tho at this point getting to these steam games just feels like a chore. 
WoogieMaster	So I just started osu, got my 1st perfect, but it got a C. Can anyone explain why? 
WoogieMaster	usually 2-3 a day.
WoogieMaster	I haven't told my family, I don't really trust they'll take depression serious. I'm a freshmen, but I don't even know who or where the school consular is. Even if I did, I still won't feel comfortable telling them just in case they would let my family know. 
WoogieMaster	I moan when I fap, and I find it more enjoyable then a quiet fap.
WoogieMaster	Looking to get into osu, any advice? | 
WoogieMaster	Physical: testicle torsion Mental: suicidal thoughts 
WoogieMaster	how?
WoogieMaster	I'm back in school and now as soon as I get home all I want to do is sleep. I go to sleep at 8 or 9 and wake up at 6, but im drifting off at 2 in the afternoon.
WoogieMaster	Most of my friend are female, and I treat them like people. I look at them as just another person and disregard their gender when looking at them as friend. sure every now and then i'll look at them but its not often and I don't on purposely do it. 
WoogieMaster	I dont have 2 because I went to the doc, testicle torsion.
WoogieMaster	Just had my 1st day of high school, any advice for this new freshmen?
WoogieMaster	thx :)
WoogieMaster	I'm also into getting farted on, but I prefer a chubby girl instead. 
WoogieMaster	[kemonomimi?](https://www.reddit.com/r/kemonomimi)
WoogieMaster	Thanks for this. I have a mouse so the only other stuff I would need to pick is a keyboard and display, I already have a mouse a good mouse. 
WoogieMaster	So i'm looking to get my 1st gaming pc, right now all I have a is a simple little HP laptop. I've heard that building your Pc is a the way to go, but I don't know how to build one. Another thing is that my budget isn't the highest, like 600$ max. I don't know if this matters or not, but my only source of internet is the hotspot on my Ipad. What should I go for and where do I learn to build a PC?
WoogieMaster	I live in an apple covered in pines above the sea. 
WoogieMaster	I hate molesters in general
WoogieMaster	A nice head pat, well it would make me happy for sure
WoogieMaster	"i'm into that"
WoogieMaster	Because I don't have the time or a way to do so, and my last depression spell has passed so my mind isnt in the deep end atm. 
WoogieMaster	 [Heres one of my favs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6q2xsc/gamers_of_reddit_what_is_the_most_vicious_things/dkugu0j/) 
WoogieMaster	How did a post on /r/hentai make it to the front page of reddit?  also gud shit
WoogieMaster	oh, thx for letting me know
WoogieMaster	I like the chubbiness to her, both cute and thicc. 
WoogieMaster	That last one...
WoogieMaster	It depends, if it's someone's secret then I'll keep quite. If someone is talking trash about me behind my back I'll confront them about the matter.
WoogieMaster	I like a nice sexy nurse. 
WoogieMaster	Pink hair is my fav color of hair.
WoogieMaster	I still find cosplays of my waifus pretty hot.
WoogieMaster	no need to be sorry, you are you buddy
WoogieMaster	Rabi Ribi
WoogieMaster	I lay on my back and put an old, white shirt on my torso and just cum onto it so I don't have to worry about catching my cum.
WoogieMaster	I would much rather have than then "its just sadness".
WoogieMaster	My fetishes
WoogieMaster	Heterochromia, scars, and a bit of plumpness.  Edit, I forgot to say tall girls
WoogieMaster	I've wanted to bone a few of them. 
WoogieMaster	When I realized I have more female friends than male friends.
WoogieMaster	but sadly not cured 
WoogieMaster	The testicle twist to the point where it prevents blood blow
WoogieMaster	I mean if someone did id *constantly* then I would bothered, but if it happened every now and then I would just blow it off. 
WoogieMaster	nah, doesn't really interest me. I don't hate it in the way you do it, have some control over it instead of doing all day everyday. Even then I don't *hate* it, it just doesn't sit right with me. If I found out someone i'm near normally did ever once and a while I wouldnt be that bothered. If I were to meet somone irl with this fetish, I wouldn't mind. 
WoogieMaster	getting called gay for liking a girl... it hurts to know i'm starting high school on the third. 
WoogieMaster	at least you didn't eat a whole box
WoogieMaster	because i have a fart fetish and may or may not get more joy than intended from this
WoogieMaster	I've been having my fart fetish for years now, at 1st I was ashamed and weirded out by myself thinking I was some sort of deviant that'll just be throw out by the world for being so weird. Now i've learned to accept it and it's been nothing but bliss since. Cheers mate.
WoogieMaster	I'm male. How often do you have these phases and how long do they last?
WoogieMaster	One who can comfort me when I go through a depression spell and start having *those* thoughts, accept my weird side(fetishes mainly), one who can give me a nice head rub or back scratch. One who is an introvert like me, one I can sit down with and binge speedruns, play games together, watch anime, read reddit, ect. Physical features waise, one who is tall, and/or has a bit of plumpness to her. For breast, well I like'em big so the bigger the better.  I feel like I should say this just in case I get downvoted, but i'm not asking for a girl with *all* these features of course.   
WoogieMaster	Is it just spit, or have you tried other things such snot?
WoogieMaster	This is the 1st time i've ever heard about this fetish so now im craving to learn, if you don't mind that is? Also as someone who has fetish for farts and a little bit of scat, this isn't *that* nasty.   How would you like/have put this into action during foreplay or intercourse?  Can you say exactly what about it you like?
WoogieMaster	at least someone remembered my question
WoogieMaster	or your own. someone near my house yesterday killed himself showing off to his friends. 
WoogieMaster	I'm laying down on the lap of the of a girl with massive tits while suckling her breast as she runs her hand through my hair. Another girl is sitting on my thigh, rubbing her ass back and forth moaning and letting out big, long, loud, strong smelling farts. A 3rd girl is using her big boobs to smother my penis as I lose control of my waist and fuck her nice soft tits. 
WoogieMaster	Why did the chicken cross the road? | 
WoogieMaster	chips
WoogieMaster	coelacanth, such a cute fish
WoogieMaster	I once went to a school where a red or white polo shirt was part of the uniform and it had to be tucked in. 
WoogieMaster	hey, if a girl asked me to do it, I wouldnt mind. 
WoogieMaster	sounds like some caveman sex
WoogieMaster	you could say, i'm, *bad to the bone*. but ya jho is just fun to fight, tho if a guest monster shows up, I normally dung my target and kill the guest. 
WoogieMaster	No, squirrels are pretty under control. I live in tennessee but the people I live around just get joy out of it.  
WoogieMaster	well my uncle hit on squirrel a few months ago, but *smashed* squirrel isnt the best thing to cook.
WoogieMaster	well i'm limited money wise, so my choices are a gaming PC or a switch, and theres more games I want on a gaming PC than the switch atm. and I do have a 3ds so its not like im missing out 100% on nintendo anymore. 
WoogieMaster	I like women with clean nails, I think its a gender neutral thing.
WoogieMaster	I canceled getting a switch for this game, *it better be worth*
WoogieMaster	where i live, its common to try and hit a squirrel full speed if it just happens to be trying to cross the road. Personally i'm not crazy for animals but come on man.
avatarshark	Yeah it turned out ok, thanks
avatarshark	I'm really freaking out. I want to call the police to make sure everything is good but I don't want to make a scene if there's nothing. She has had depressive tendencies in the past although she's never gone to get diagnosed. I don't have any of her family member's phone numbers to contact them. I knocked on the door and no one was getting up to open. Just her dogs barking but I know there were people home because the kitchen light were on and her mom's car was parked in front
avatarshark	Should I call the police? | My girlfriend and I had a fight earlier at night. I fell asleep and didn't realize she was sending me messages begging me to answer her. Her last message said "If I'm gone tonight, I love you" I'm freaking out because I'm afraid she did something. I was knocking on the door to her house at 2 am and no one answered me, I'm pretty sure her mom, brother and sister were home. I've been bombarding her phone with calls and she doesn't answer. Not sure if she put it on silent or I'm fearing the worst
avatarshark	I think she might have depression. I don't think she's ever been diagnosed but she's mentioned it and lets stress get to her really easily. She said she used to cut herself in middle school on her thigh
avatarshark	12:17 am. It's now 2:44 am 
avatarshark	I was there a few minutes ago and no one answered the door when I was knocking
avatarshark	My girlfriend and I had a fight earlier at night. I fell asleep and didn't realize she was sending me messages begging me to answer her.

avatarshark	Should I call the police over this weird message my girlfriend sent me? [Serious] | 
avatarshark	More between her and the coworker?
avatarshark	She initiated the break because she feels guilty and needs time alone to process and think about everything that happened. She's confused. She said she needs to time alone to think about what's happening to us, to think about why exactly she liked the kiss, to figure out what exactly she's feeling.  She's confused and irritated with her self 
avatarshark	Well to be honest I want to forgive her because she didn't kiss him, he basically forced the kiss. I want things to be back to normal.  I'm just afraid that this is something we will struggle to get past or worse won't be able to get past because as she said she liked it. She says she doesn't like the guy but she liked the thought that other people find her attractive and that is why she liked the kiss. And I know I should forget about this scumbag and focus on her but just the thought that this guy is what broke us apart irritates me, the thought of another guy kissing my girlfriend bugs me to no end. The thought that he "wins" if all of this goes under.  The thought that things won't be the same and the thought that I'm losing the person who I've cared and loved and shared precious memories with will be gone saddens me. Beside being my girlfriend she was my best friend  I'm afraid that I've already lost her 
avatarshark	Haha nice Office reference 
avatarshark	Thanks for the advice ! 
avatarshark	I honestly wish I could beat him up but I've never even met this guy so I don't know who he is lol. I'm just so consumed with anger toward this person it's ridiculous I've never felt like this. But I already promised I wouldn't do anything stupid   But you're right if this relationship is to be salvaged I have to focus on her. I'm just going to wait for my gf to reach out to me that way I know we're ready to talk it out. 
avatarshark	Right now the whole situation is still fresh. I'm still so angry. Angry at this guy and at the situation we are in. I've never felt this type of anger toward a person.  My girlfriend is just consumed with guilt at the moment. We've tried to talk again but the emotions are still running high that we couldn't have a proper conversation. I'm not angry at my girlfriend but she wants me to be mad at her because she's blaming herself. 
avatarshark	Yeah I told her that I really appreciate her being honest with me. The news that this happened sucks so much but I'm glad that she was honest with me.   I don't know if it makes me old school or what but wtf. What is going on with people?? At least personally if I know a girl is in a relationship I would back off when I was single. I would back off because I respect a relationship it's just so scummy to know a girl is in a relationship and still go and hit on the girl and in this case still go as far as forcing a kiss especially in the work place. What is wrong with people ?
avatarshark	Don't do it. If you know she's married stay away from her. It sucks being the other guy in the case it would be her husband

sophie10703	the same thing that makes me happy makes me so sad | I crave social interaction. I yearn for it. I love talking with people, hanging out, doing fun things... I'm an extrovert. But once it's over, when they hang up the call, or the night out comes to an end, paranoia takes over. Logic doesn't exist in my head at those moments. I become over-analytical. 'Were they ignoring me all night?' 'Does he actually like me or is he just being nice?' 'Why do they always hang out without me? They must hate me. I'm too crude.' 'Why won't he talk to me? I'm being too annoying, too clingy.' All of these ideas rush to my head and I wallow in self-pity. I need to talk to someone, BE with someone so my ideas don't swallow me whole. If I'm alone, my thoughts BECOME me. Does anyone else feel this too? It's my first time on reddit, by the way.
sophie10703	You should totally ask! Make it seem laid back and don't urge her to come. Say something on the lines of "I'm going to the movies, wanna come?" because then she doesn't feel inclined to come, if that makes sense. That way you'll know if she genuinely wants to hang out or if she's too nervous to say no.
sophie10703	You're* your*
sophie10703	You're* your*
sophie10703	Thanks! I'm talking to him right now on Snapchat and he makes me so happy :) Thank you for your motivation!!
sophie10703	I know, I don't think it's weird but I'm worried he does.
sophie10703	It's 3 years right now but my birthday is October 7. It doesn't seem like a big difference but we're in high school, so it's a bit magnified.
sophie10703	Awh, thank you! But I don't feel too comfortable straight-up asking him though. We have an age difference that's a bit significant. I personally don't mind it but he might so I don't know if just putting it out on the table is a good thing.
sophie10703	first date | So, I'm going to see a movie with this guy I REALLY like Wednesday night. But I have no clue if he thinks it's a date or not. I'm pretty sure he knows I like him but I don't know if he likes me. I'm so paranoid that he thinks I'm annoying or clingy. We talk all the time on FaceTime, for hours at a time, so it's likely not that. I just don't know if he genuinely likes me romantically or if he just thinks we're friends and/or he's being nice. I worry I'm not attractive enough or my personality is too clingy. Anyways I'm really nervous for our "date" (if you can even call it that) and have no clue as to how I should act. Should I flirt with him or just be friendly?
sophie10703	It's seasonal with me. In summer, I'm very bubbly and happy. Come time for school, I'm a wreck.
SQLwitch	You might want to come talk to us over at /r/SuicideBereavement and/or check out the list of resources in the sidebar there. Really sorry for your loss.
SQLwitch	I bet you feel like the [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg).    But here's the thing  - the analogy on which the video's based is (much of the time, at any rate) inherently flawed by a profound lack of understanding.  To fix the analogy, the nail would actually be an outgrowth of some sort of disease, i.e. only the tip of the iceberg.  And either cutting it off or pulling it out would cause a fatal hemorrhage and make the underlying disease even worse.    >  She constantly demands special treatment for these problems. But she's never been treated or diagnosed. And she fights me on getting treatment and diagnosis.  This type of pattern is, unfortunately, all too common.  The best way I can explain it is by analogy with Gollum and lembas.  When the hobbits tried to feed Gollum some elven bread, he honestly experienced it as poisonous, even though it was the most nourishing and healing thing in all of middle earth and would have truly done him good if he'd been able to stomach it.  When people have spent too much time in a dark place, medicine (in the literal or metaphorical sense) can truly seem like poison to them, and help can seem like a threat.    It is a symptom of her illness that her judgement about what she needs is skewed to the point of self-destruction.  That makes her incredibly hard to help, and it means you probably can't escape some tough choices and difficult confrontations.    Although I have extremely sympathy for your frustration, is it truly that she is "demanding special treatment" or simply that she is just unable to cope with more than her schooling?   Do you think she feels entitled to special treatment and is using her alleged (because undiagnosed) mental illness as an excuse, or do you think she's overwhelmed but feels that she doesn't deserve help?  If you don't know, maybe figuring out more about that will help you have some more fruitful conversations with her.    What it looks like to me (what follows is just an educated guess, so keep your salt shaker handy ;->)  is that she's deeply conflicted in herself, and you're looking for a consistent picture, which you're simply not going to find.  It seems like she feels like she ought to be able to fix her own issues (so she rejects professional help), but she's genuinely overwhelmed (hence the inability to keep up with anything except school - and I suspect she may have been socialised to believe that work/school responsibility trumps all others), and thus constantly feels like a failure (hence the counterproductive self-punishment) yet also feels a genuine sense of need (hence the "demanding special treatment").    I can't possibly diagnose her, but based on my experience (not a clinician, but 20+ years on a mental-health crisis line), I suspect she's got more going on than "pure" depression.  What's her family like?  It sounds like she's been raised in what we call an "invalidating environment", and that can lead to all sorts of contradictory behaviour patterns.  Sometimes it's "I hate you, don't leave me" and sometimes it's "I'm in trouble, don't help me".    
SQLwitch	So sorry for your loss.  You might want to check out /r/SuicideBereavement and the resources in the sidebar there.  
SQLwitch	Please don't invite private contact as a first resort here.  This violates the guidelines posted in the sidebar. 
SQLwitch	One of the hardest things for new people at our hotline is not knowing the outcome for most of the people we talk to.  You've accidentally stumbled into the same position of caring but not knowing.   I wouldn't be too sure that you didn't help him.  Very often with people who are deep in despair, and especially the "thinking types", which your guy definitely seems to be, it takes a while for the caring and support we offer them to sink in.  It's quite common for a hotline call to end with the caller giving no indication that their mood or desire to end their lives has shifted, or even for them to tell us right before hanging up that we weren't very helpful at all.  Yet, more often than you might think, we hear back from the same people some time (sometimes even years) later that our kindness made a pivotal difference.    Of course neither of us can know for sure, but I think in this case there's reason to hope.    In case he does come back in, you might want to have a [glance at our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) so you're forearmed with some solid conversational tactics.    Hugs.    
SQLwitch	Thanks for your help.
SQLwitch	Your suggestion, if followed, would violate the rules in both /r/SuicideWatch and /r/depression.  Please be more mindful of community polices when suggesting activities in support subs. 
SQLwitch	> If he would have known upfront it might not have been a problem?  It still would have been a huge problem.  At the time [a woman who'd had sex out of wedlock would be considered "fallen"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen_woman#Social_situation) (and lost most of her human rights, or, crassly, her "market value" to the redpillers of the era :-\).  Most fallen women were banished from "polite society" and would taint anyone by association.  Fernando being a good Catholic boy would believe that she'd burn in Hell forever and so would he if he had anything to do with her.  Fernando is naive so he didn't figure it out on his own.  The dramatic irony comes from that, coupled with the fact that he's a moral, upstanding person according to the virtue ethics of the time, so if he *had* known she was anybody's mistress, he wouldn't have fallen in love with her because he wouldn't have considered her a person that he *could* fall in love with.  He wouldn't have considered her fully human, basically.  That was the morality of the time.  The plot of Traviata (and a shitton of other operas, plays and books from the 19th going back to the dawn of literature) turns on the same thing.  This was a *huge* deal - the virginity cult was fully mainstream - in fact there wasn't much that was a bigger deal, morally speaking, in the day.  Even the redemption stories where a fallen woman is "saved" usually don't involve her restoration to anything like the position in society she would have held if she'd remained "chaste".   
SQLwitch	Me too, as it happens.  All the hotlines are regional here at present (my agency is part of the national hotlines network project but it won't be online for a couple of years at least).  Send your location to our modmail  (address a PM to /r/depression) and we'll see what we can find for you.  
SQLwitch	> Do you have a link for a chat hotline?  Depends where you're located.  We have some, and most hotlines offer a chat service at least part of the time these days.  
SQLwitch	>  suicidal ideation, planning and attempts are a pretty regular part of my life  I think a lot of us here can relate to that.  Glad you reached out.  Could you tell us a bit more about yourself and your situation?  Some specific questions follow.    > I've never used a chat, hotline or anything before   Any particular reason why not?  Not going to try to change your mind, just want to understand your experience of suicidal ideation a bit better.    >  I had a tough session in therapy yesterday   How long have you been in therapy and how's it going generally?  > Emergency services where I am are retraumatizing and not welcome right now.  Most places now have mental-health crisis teams that are specifically designed to avoid traumatic experiences that police/ER interventions can cause.  There may not be one in your area, but it might be worth looking.    >  just processing a lot of feels right now.  Can you say more about the emotions you're working through?  Hugs and welcome.  
SQLwitch	>  People often find dissociation interesting heh.   It was more the hypnosis aspects.  Dissociation is routine for me, although things are a lot better and more together than they used to me.    > There needs to be way more trauma education.  True that.  
SQLwitch	> I've dealt specifically with mental health crisis teams. Lack of funding means they try to avoid seeing one until they have to, then get them out as soon as possible.  That's really unfortunate.  Seems to me that the penny-pinching approach (which may be an absolute necessity if they're badly underfunded) sucks most of the unique value out of the service.    >  I really like my therapist right now. He has a lot of experience with what I have   Good to know.    >  Before session a part came out and during session she integrated. So I am dealing with her pain and memories as well as trying to assimilate posthypnotic instructions that are somewhat alien to me (any kind of growth is going to seem alien at first I suppose).   I have to say that that sounds *fascinating*.   One thing I personally relate to pretty strongly is the idea of even constructive change feeling alien.  If we were raised or have spent a formative amount of time in a psychologically dark place, we can turn out to  be a bit like Gollum when the hobbits try to feed him Elven bread and experience the most purely nourishing thing in the world as poisonous.  (Tolkien, among other things, was an excellent psychologist imnsho).       
SQLwitch	Helpers soliciting PMs as a first resort is a direct violation of the sidebar guidelines, please don't do this.  
SQLwitch	Based on what I've seen over the years, both here and elsewhere including a mental-health crisis line, I think it unlikely that other people's anecdotal accounts will help you much.  The path to recovery is *extremely* individualised.   The key attitudes that seem to be correlated with achieving stable, long-term recovery are a) willingness to consult experts and b) willingness to multi-focal approaches (i.e. using meds to support the process of talk therapy, for example).  Almost as important is making sure that you make yourself an informed consumer, [especially in the case of counselling or talk therapy](http://www.metanoia.org/choose), so that you can bring some critical thinking to bear in case you happen to end up with an incompetent "expert".    I will say that what you're describing sounds to me more like toxic shame than clinical depression, so you might want to look into that a bit.  [Here's a video by John Bradshaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q2tZa1gp8Q&t=39s) who coined the phrase 'toxic shame'.  Don't be put off by his evangelist-preacher demeanor (he used to be one) -- his work is solidly based on scientific evidence.    And here's an article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-destructive-anger/201704/overcoming-the-paralysis-toxic-shame
SQLwitch	It isn't so much a "final leap" as a perfect storm with 3 main factors. Here's a pretty goid tl;dr: http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief.aspx
SQLwitch	Of course. All the books and major papers.
SQLwitch	My personal opinion, based on what his work has helped as a hotline responder with 20+ years experience (i.e. doing the work before and after his model was published) is that Joiner will be recognised as being to suicidology what Isaac Newton was to physics.
SQLwitch	The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Removed.
SQLwitch	Sorry, this sort of general enquiry is not appropriate for a support space.  Either ask over at /r/suicidology or check out Thomas Joiner's books *Why People Die by Suicide* and *Myths About Suicide* which summarise all the data that's been gathered since the topic began to be studied empirically and offer the best empirical model of the suicidal mindset that we have.
SQLwitch	For some reason, dental hygiene seems to be one of the things that depression makes impossible to maintain.  And we can get into a vicious cycle of shame and inaction where we blame ourselves for our symptoms and that makes it harder to change the pattern, because of the overwhelming shame we feel at facing the results of our symptoms.    The best tactic I know is to recognise that this is blaming ourselves for the symptoms of a real illness, which we wouldn't do if the illness was physical rather than mental.  Depression causes mental paralysis that can be really debilitating, and sometimes it's spotty; we can do some mental operations but not others, we can have pockets of things (especially self-care) where we simply can't motivate ourselves for a while. If you recognize that the act of dealing with dental hygiene has become linked in your mind with overwhelming feelings of shame over something that truly isn't your fault, that may help you to separate things back into their distinct categories.    There are a letter about pretty much exactly this in Dear Prudence a while back so you're definitely not alone.  I actually had a conversation with my own dentist about this sort of thing because we both are fans of Prudie, and he said that they see people who've totally neglected their dental hygiene for *many years* routinely.  He said that it's so common that it's not a big deal, except in that they're always glad to see somebody getting things back on track and try to support them in every way that they can.    I'm really glad that you've taken steps to see the counsellors at your school.  I too was very young when I was in advanced education, and it too took a serious toll on my own mental health, which was already compromised for other reasons.  It sounds like you have been taught to be very harsh with yourself, as I was, so I find myself wondering if [the concept of "toxic shame"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-destructive-anger/201704/overcoming-the-paralysis-toxic-shame) might be helpful to you, like it was for me.    
SQLwitch	We definitely appreciate your great intentions and your open-mindedness.  I lost two of the most important people in my own life to suicide, so I do understand what you're saying about how your experience motivates you to get involved in prevention. 
SQLwitch	> Well I posted something similar a few times and was well received  Definitely wasn't here unless you deleted it.  However, YSK that there are a lot of misconceptions about suicide out there, and the result is that material that do great harm can be wildly popular among the general public who mean well but just don't know what is and isn't helpful.  That's why a lot of our rules (which are all based on the best science we can find, and the mod team's collective experience and training in suicide intervention, which is significant) are extremely surprising to a lot of people.    There are a lot of "support" communities online and specifically here at reddit, including at least one I see in your history, whose founders and core constituencies are basically the mental-health equivalent of anti-vaxxers.  They usually are people whose contributions were consistently removed either here or in our sister sub /r/depression, because they go against everything the actual science tells us.  
SQLwitch	I read in your other post a) you've been referred to our talking tips and risk assessment guide, which give you tactics you can use from anywhere and b) that you know E's city.  [Send it to us in modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch), and we'll be glad to use our experience navigating the north american mental-health system to find any age-appropriate resources that may be appropriate for her.  
SQLwitch	Popularity is irrelevant here.
SQLwitch	I failed out of various levels of university 3 times myself due a debilitating combination of depression, anxiety, and toxic shame.  Do you mind if I ask how you came to put yourself on such a demanding accelerated academic track?  When I read what you've written, I keep thinking of something I said to my therapist a long time ago.  "It's like I've spent my whole life on a treadmill, and every time I stumble I have to punish myself by turning up the speed.”
SQLwitch	That sounds like very harsh self-criticism.  If you're full of anxiety or dread at having an uncomfortable conversation with your roommates, and you're depressed, it's understandable that it would be a struggle to actually get yourself to the point of doing it.  Depression sort of paralyses the exact mental "muscles" we need to push through the tough patches.  
SQLwitch	> Please, tell me, what am I missing.  Maybe you're not missing anything.  Maybe this person is just not a fit for you, or maybe he's just bad at his job.  Some counsellors out there are making a fine living doing a terrible job with most of their clients.    But maybe he just needs more time to connect with you.  It's pretty typical for the first session to be kind of a dud - it was for me with the therapist who eventually turned out to be more help than all the rest put together (I tried quite a few, back in the day).    [The best guide I know to how the process is supposed to work, when it works, is metanoia's](http://www.metanoia.org/choose).  It's a bit of a long read, but the goal of it is to help people become informed consumers of the service, so that they a) know what to expect and b) can identify the good - and bad - practitioners. 
SQLwitch	I think it more likely that you have some misconceptions about how to do suicide prevention/intervention.  The sidebar should help - if it doesn't help enough, please feel free to send us a modmail with your questions.  
SQLwitch	Removed, sidebar point 4c.
SQLwitch	> Depression is impossible to escape from.  Hanging out here can make that seem more universally true than it is.  It's certainly true that the treatments that are currently available help some people more than others.  But the people who achieve stable recovery tend to leave depression support communities and just get on with their lives, so from the perspective of this little corner of the internet, it may seem that the success stories don't exist.    In my experience, the people who do best usually are the ones who are willing to keep trying different things, and usually end up getting some sort of clinical therapy (either meds, or some other therapy that addresses depression on a biochemical/neurological level) and some sort of talk therapy, and some sort of peer support.   Obviously this group can only provide one of those things.  
SQLwitch	Well, if I were Dear Prudence, I'd probably say that if they're real friends they'll understand, and if all they are is future ex-roommates, then it doesn't matter whether they understand or not.  But I get where you're coming from.  Sounds like you've done the best you could to handle the situation while dealing with your depression.  Trouble is that depression tends to provoke us to beat ourselves up for "failing" to do *more* than our best.  
SQLwitch	> Give him some time to process and then discuss.  Sounds like a sensible approach.  Fingers crossed.  
SQLwitch	Yikes.  Maybe I'm judging without enough context but that sounds passive-aggressive AF to me.  So sorry you've got that to contend with on top of everything else.  Hugs.  
SQLwitch	> My SO took it less than well   ???  Can you say more about that?  
SQLwitch	It's really difficult to be in that kind of a position.  It's clear that you really care about her, but there may be no way to learn exactly what caused her to stop messaging you, if you don't hear from her again.    We deal with that a lot at hotlines also; we get deeply connected to our callers, especially the people we end up talking to multiple times.  But usually we never know how things turn out from them; they just stop calling.  Most of the time, that's because they don't need to call any more, but we almost never know for sure.    It sounds like you've been the best friend to her that you could in the circumstances, so even if the outcome is a sad one, that doesn't mean she didn't have a better chance with you in her life than without you.  But a better chance is not a certainty.  Hugs.   
SQLwitch	Don't clutter up the sub with a post for this. If you discover your content violated a rule, fix it or delete it. You're welcome to message us if you're unsure.
SQLwitch	No real specifics, but a shitton of right-wing dog whistles.
SQLwitch	Thanks.  First, there are many, many reasons why someone would go dark, and the vast majority of the time it's not because they've done something to harm themselves even if they've expressed suicidal ideation.  That's not because people lie, but because our survival instinct is incredibly strong even in people who are so miserable that they're contemplating suicide, and it takes a lot to overcome it.    Unfortunately, Kik will only initiate retrieval of identity information in response to requests from law enforcement, so do to a welfare check, you'd somehow have to get in touch with her local police.    How long has it been since you've heard from her?  I would be inclined to keep sending supportive messages (use the talking tips in our sidebar for guidance), just in case she's listening but doesn't feel up to responding for whatever reason.     
SQLwitch	Good to know <3
SQLwitch	Depending on the platform, there may be options for reaching out to the administrators.  Do you mind saying what site(s)/app(s) you've been communicating with her on?    Can you tell us a bit more of what you know about her and her situation?  It's not easy to assess risk accurately from online communication at the best of times, let alone second-hand, but sometimes there are factors that are strong indicators one way or the other.  
SQLwitch	No it's not just your head.  I think that depression often manifests psychologically much like physical paralysis does.  Sometimes it affects one area of mental/motivational functioning and not another just as paralysis sometimes affects one region of the body but not another.  So sometimes you are inexplicably unable to get yourself to do certain things, even if you can do some others.   
SQLwitch	Telling you "everything will be ok" would be a direct violation of the community rules here.    We can't help you find a "good" way to die (if there is such a thing), but we do want to understand what you're going through.  Not so we can argue with you about your intentions, though.  We think anybody who's in such a dark place at the very least deserves some understanding.  
SQLwitch	No matter how much love and good intentions he brings to the conversation, if he chronically misunderstands you it's going to add to your pain.  Sometimes the people closest to us are simply not the best equipped to help - there can be a "can't see the forest for the trees" phenomenon where they are just too close to the situation to get themselves oriented to a useful perspective.    And it sounds to me like he's trying to be comforting by saying things that boil down to "it's not so bad".  That seems logical and reasonable, but in fact it's usually the opposite of helpfull the [/r/SuicideWatch talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) explains more about this if you're interested.    
SQLwitch	> Last night he was trying to make me feel better and said "everyone gets depressed sometimes".  I know he's just trying to make me feel better but it just makes me feel worse.     Not everyone gets *clinically* depressed sometimes.   Unfortunately, we use the same word for normal, healthy low moods and the mental illness requiring treament.    It sounds like he was trying to normalise your depression, comfort you by putting it into perspective.  But if what you're experience is something that you know in your gut is *not* a normal low mood, then that would be painful and invalidating even if that's the opposite of what he intended.   
SQLwitch	> Actually, as a kid I really liked drawing. I showed my drawing to a bunch of other kids and they all thought I was great. Sometime around age 13, I just totally stopped.  Depression can basically shut off creativity (definitely and dramatically the case for me, as it happens), and a lot of people who are prone to depression start to experience it around that age.    It sounds to me like you're pretty disconnected from your emotions - and if we're disconnected from our emotions it's also common not to be able to identify values.    > Not sure why.   Do you remember what was going on your life (besides puberty, of course) around that time? 
SQLwitch	Removed due to lack of any obvious relevance to this community.  It's possible that you might want /r/SuicideBereavement. 
SQLwitch	>   As far as values, eh, that kind of goes back to the whole just not caring thing.  Can you remember a time in your life when it wasn't like that?    
SQLwitch	What we find in practice is that sometimes the best person to pull someone back from the edge is the person who's only a step or two behind them.  In more clinical terms, the most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of being truly understood.  Have you seen [the talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87), which is always linked from our sidebar?  It, and the references it links to, has a lot of information about building rapport.  You might think that it's not necessary or relevant because you and he are extremely close already, but the act of *explicitly reflecting back* can sometimes create a whole other level of interpersonal connection even in loving, intimate relationships.   And being in rapport with someone usually benefits the "helper" as well as the "help-ee".  The energising, uplifting benefits of experiencing deep rapport with someone are well known to hotline responders - the people who can do it sustainably are the ones who can create deep connections with most of the people they speak to.   
SQLwitch	That sounds very sensible.  Obviously you don't want to shut your husband out, but you've got experts in your life and what they're telling you is entirely different from his maybe-too-hopeful but loving take on your situation.    It may be that at some point you might see an opportunity to gently point out to him that saying "it's not so bad" in any way is a kind, gentle, but genuine case of [this](http://www.akimbocomics.com/?p=573), but in my experience, we've got to choose our moments for that sort of loving confrontation carefully.      
SQLwitch	It's not so simple though, because depression induces a false belief that we can't be helped and don't deserve to be helped.
SQLwitch	How do you know, though?
SQLwitch	>  I dont think that anyone could help, ... if they try to help they will fail.  Why do you think that?  > i dont need help  Do you really mean you don't feel like you deserve help...? 
SQLwitch	Depression causes fatigue, inability to motivate oneself, and cognitive deficits.  When I was depressed I went from a top student to literally failing out of college practically overnight.    It sounds like you're blaming yourself for your symptoms, and that hardly seems fair to me.    Have you sought treatment?  Or thought about it...?  
SQLwitch	> What do you do when you miss someone who you will most likely never see again? It's like I'm grieving because I've lost an important connection and possible friendship.  I don't think it's "like" grieving, I think it *is* grieving.  The death of a relationship can change the shape of our personal universe as much as the death of a person.  It's a real loss and it's healthy and necessary to mourn it.  Every grieving process has its own shape and its own timeline, and we don't get to decide how it's going to go.  All we can do is walk the path as we find it, one step at a time.  Most of the time, the path is pretty twisty, and they go through rough and hilly terrain, so it's completely normal at certain points to be unable to see the way forward.    Hugs.  
SQLwitch	Can you say more about the kind of thoughts and feelings that are getting stronger?  Depression can manifest in a lot of different ways.  
SQLwitch	How long have you felt this way?  Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your situation?     > Even i cant understand.  If you can share the struggle, maybe we can get a bit further toward understanding together.  
SQLwitch	The mods always maintain a stickied check-in post for this purpose.  We keep the sort to 'new' by default so the volume of comments is not an impediment to new comments getting responses.   
SQLwitch	That sounds like the person (whether it's you or someone else) is getting sucked into what we call the dark vortex.    Reaching someone who's caught in the vicious cycle of self-loathing and self-destruction can be difficult, no question.  It's like trying to get Gollum to eat Elven bread.  What would truly do him good seems poisonous, because he's in thrall to the dark side.  (Tolkien was an excellent psychologist!)    In general, what we find is the first and most essential thing is rapport.  Giving someone the experience of feeling understood is the most reliable way we know to start the process of de-escalating someone.  
SQLwitch	FYI, putting "Admins" or, more properly, "Mods" in a title, post body, or comment *does absolutely nothing* to get the attention of the community moderators.    If you have a question about community policies, [please use modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression), that's what it's for.  Don't make a post that takes focus away from our OPs in need of support.  As far as I can tell, your question seems to be about suicide-related content in this community, and, as it happens, this issue is addressed in detail in [the current sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6swsuk/regular_checkin_and_some_info_about_highrisk_posts/).  
SQLwitch	Removed, no activism is allowed here per the sidebar.
SQLwitch	Not everyone thinks "follow your passion" is good advice.   In fact, there's a growing suspicion in the collective consciousness, [largely thanks to this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMu1PGbG-0), that it's terrible advice.  [More about where the passion fallacy comes from and how to escape it here](http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/10/16/the-passion-trap-how-the-search-for-your-lifes-work-is-making-your-working-life-miserable/).    
SQLwitch	Everything is confidential unless you're at immediate risk.  Don't be deceived by internet horror stories of dubious provenance that suggest otherwise.  
SQLwitch	Thanks for clarifying. When depression and its frequent companion anhedonia obscure the picture, it can be hard, for sure. Leaving enthusiasm and liking entirely out of the picture, are you aware of what your best abilities are?  Are you able to articulate your highest personal values?
SQLwitch	We maintain a Hotlines FAQs post that's always linked from the sidebar.  I will add one about this when I get a mo.
SQLwitch	The idea that everybody just naturally has One True Passion^tm is pervasive, but there are excellent arguments to be made that it's pernicious nonsense.  I just linked to a talk and article on this subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6zca4k/how_am_i_supposed_to_follow_my_dreams_and/dmu6w9l/).  He talks about how to build a "passion"  through experience and self-awareness.
SQLwitch	I don't know any hotline that asks for callers' names except in very special circumstnaces (i.e. patching them to another service that does need names), if that's what you mean.    It's well established that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs, and all reputable  hotlines operate accordingly.  
SQLwitch	> How does a post on THIS sub get removed?  1.  We have a lot of anti-trolling filters in place.  The internet is full of scumbags who like to bully and prey on depressed people.  The rate of false positives is low, but it happens.   2.  We don't have the ability to turn off reddit's site-wide spam filter.  It snags more legit post than our community filters.    
SQLwitch	If you're having trouble with a post not showing up, [please message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression), don't take up space in the sub complaining about it.  The spam filter had your post; I've released it and it will sort as if you posted it just now.  
SQLwitch	We'll remove all inappropriate content if it's reported.  We don't have the resources to read everything in real time so we rely on the community to flag stuff like this for us.  This post achieves nothing constructive and takes focus away from OPs in need of support so we've taken it down.
SQLwitch	I am in *such* a different place these days, and have been for many years, that honestly it's a little weird for me when I talk about my past experiences and people express sympathy.  I've reached a point not just where I'm okay (stable recovery from depression for 20+ years with no meds), but where the person I've become as a result having gone through it is so much wiser and kinder than the person I know in my gut I would have been if I hadn't gone through it, that it all feels like a net positive even with all the miserable years fully factored in.    But thanks <3  
SQLwitch	He can always call a hotline himself and get expert guidance in real time.  He might also want to have a look at the info in our sidebar, especially the talking tips and risk assessment guide. Direct link if you need it: /r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar
SQLwitch	> Where are you?   ??  
SQLwitch	>  do really appreciate your help, despite how long it took me to muster a reply.  Never worry about that.  I can get pretty slow to respond myself sometimes, depending on what all's going on for me.    I'm glad my little analogy was helpful :-)  Sometimes I think finding the right analogy or metaphor is half the battle.  And in terms of bringing things to therapist, being able to bring them an inventory of what's operational and what's "paralysed" might help build their understanding of your issues.    
SQLwitch	FYI, [our talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) links to a list of the top 10 worst things to say to a suicidal person by one of the leading authorities in the field, and "permanent solution to a temporary problem" is on it.  This post violates multiple guidelines and has been removed. Please read the sidebar and the negative comments you've received carefully.
SQLwitch	If you tell us which hotline you called and where you're located, we'll try to assist.  A bit more info about your reasons for calling would help us know how best to advise you.
SQLwitch	Please don't reply to stuff like that. Report it and we'll deal.
SQLwitch	Removed, posts of this nature are a direct violation of the sidebar guidelines.
SQLwitch	Why would you want to forget? Everything we go through in life transforms us. There's no sense trying to pretend otherwise.
SQLwitch	That is pretty stupid advice imnsho.  Depression can make it both impossible to change your life and impoosible to imagine any kind of life you wouldn't hate.  Most of the time, what needs to happen first is treating the depression.
SQLwitch	Now, see that's the sort of thing I wish I could say in a mod comment.  We agree, we've taken this post down.
SQLwitch	Removed. This type of content does far more harm than good, please read the sidebar.
SQLwitch	It is, spent a fair chunk of my life tangled up in it myself.   
SQLwitch	At best, I think it's fair to say they weren't a fit for you.
SQLwitch	That doesn't sound like the wsy a competent therapist would handle a debilitating combination of depression and anxiety, but my 2 cents' worth may only have face value.
SQLwitch	Before somebody else brings it up, I made myself notorious for saying that Bartoli must only be 98% human because her coloratura sounds exactly like what you'd get if you auto-tuned a chimpanzee.  
SQLwitch	Hey, sorry for the slow reply.  My inbox gets crazy sometimes.    Social anxiety's a bitch to live with, no doubt.  Thanks for sharing all that.    Your challenges are immense, no question.  And it sounds like you haven't really found anything yet that's helped enough to make a substantive difference in how you're able to function.  That must be incredibly frustrating, given how hard you've obviously tried to help yourself.  
SQLwitch	> I feel ungrateful because I feel like crap and unsatisfied even when I have all these wonderful things and people in my life.  Well, I think that goes back to deciding how you ought to feel on the inside based on how your life looks on the outside.  And as I have said in this thread and in many other places, that's just not valid reasoning.    > My boyfriend says I should get some help since he believes I am quite depressed, but I honestly think I'm just being a whiny bitch lol.   I'm with him, fwiw.  Unfortunately the vicious cycle of depression can be that it makes you feel like you deserve no help, so you get more depressed and feel even more undeserving, lather, rinse, repeat...  You don't sound like a whiny bitch to me.  Sounds to me like you're beating yourself up because you can't cure your depression by beating yourself up.  Like I said, vicious cycle.  
SQLwitch	Hey sorry for not replying for so long.  Sometimes my reddit inbox fills up faster than I can get through it.  Anyway, it seems to me that you've learned to be really harshly critical of yourself.  If you feel that you don't deserve what you have in the outer world, why do you deserve to be called "ungrateful"?  If you learned to label yourself as ungrateful because you can't be happy with what you've been told should be enough to make you happy, the problem is not with you, it's with the crazy shit you've been taught to think.  Imnsho, of course :-)  
SQLwitch	Hey, sorry for the slow response - my inbox has been disasterfied the past few days.    It sounds like your parents have both, in their own ways, put their own interests and their own desires not to face any discomfort above your well-being.  That *in itself* is an emotionally abusive way to treat a child, especially a young child.  Sometimes people talk about emotional *neglect* which is the most commonly-downplayed variant of childhood emotional abuse, because it's not active.    Here's some stuff to read and see how much of it you relate to (if you wish, of course!)  http://www.vachss.com/av_dispatches/disp_9408_a.html      https://themighty.com/2017/06/childhood-emotional-abuse-adult-habits/     http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-labier/childhood-psychological-a_b_6301538.html      https://wehavekids.com/parenting/The-Long-Term-Effects-of-Childhood-Emotional-Neglect           
SQLwitch	> Is this a symptom of depression  It absolutely can be.  It can also be a sign of mild dissociation which is a very common symptom of PTSD.    Protip:  The people who worry about whether they're an awful person never actually are.  Truly awful people usually think very well of themselves. 
SQLwitch	Thanks, we appreciate your understanding. 
SQLwitch	>  the usual self-loathing   K, what do you most loathe about yourself and why?  I am seriously interested. 
SQLwitch	> Just a lot of negative yelling which I already know and accept, but guess accepting things doesn't make the yelling end.  What's the negative yelling about?  And you're welcome.  I didn't find it senseless, though.  Just because something doesn't make *literal* sense doesn't mean that it isn't logical on another level.  (This is true in many more contexts than here!)
SQLwitch	>  I never have any actual reason  Uh, do you mean that you never have any *external-world* reason...?   Because that's hardly the same thing, since everything we experience is inside our heads.  We only have access to the outside world via out brains, and nobody can actually prove that we're not brains in jars or pods in the Matrix.    So if you're miserable inside your head, you're miserable, period.  Sure, there's a correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience, but it's a lot weaker than most first-world cultures tend to presume.    So, what's it like inside your head?  How does it suck in there?  
SQLwitch	This point is covered in detail in [this PSA post](http://redd.it/25igd7) from over at /r/SuicideWatch.    At SW,  we actually have a rule against any kind of "impossible reassurance" or "impossible promise".  There are even more problems with this type of "support" than what you've mentioned here.  **tl;dr: yes**
SQLwitch	I'm going to take that as a metaphor for how awful you feel.  Pretty sure you know that's neither a fair nor realistic thing to ask literally.   What's going on that's brought you to this point?  
SQLwitch	It all depends on where they're located.  If you [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) with his location - don't post it! - we'll be glad to assist.  
SQLwitch	There's lots of good info over at /r/bipolar.  What he's not is actually not the same thing as depression, so this is not the best place to look for information about his situation.  
SQLwitch	Hey there, in future could you please report ~~shit~~ content of that nature **instead of** replying to it?  We can't deal if nobody tells us, and engaging with them can sometimes give them exactly what they want.  We've got your back here, but we don't have the resources to read everything on the sub in real time, so we need to rely on the community to let us know about situations that need our attention.  
throwaway2017sss	IDK how much it counts as getting better but lately I'm investing more time in accomplishing things rather than not. Trying to move away from social media and the dumb thrill of getting likes on a post and other things about it that upset me. Im not logged into social media on my new phone except here. I have been cleaning more too. I've found something great that can make me money that I have been putting my effort in. Technically, I 'have my life together now.' I still feel sad and I still am alone but I guess I have stuff to do. I am also trying to learn to be a better person..
throwaway2017sss	Yes. I didn't think that she was wrong or that it was a weird response.   It's just that I feel that way all the time. 
throwaway2017sss	Upset at Me | My mom got upset at me when I said "I hope I die in my sleep." She said something like, "don't say something like that!"  I used to be far more vocal about it but I still always want to die. I just haven't said it in a while and she got shocked.
throwaway2017sss	Yes
throwaway2017sss	Yea I self harmed once because I kept not lining up the edges of a paper thing  perfectly
throwaway2017sss	Sad | I don't really have the capacity to care about other people And I wish I could care about people And I am lonely and I miss being a kid and having my one real friend and caring about people I wish that someone could care about me without me having to care about them because I can't really What went wrong why do I have to be like this
throwaway2017sss	She already knows I don't want to be here and she's known for a long time Yes I do know as I am a sort of 'special needs' student and if I was dead she wouldn't need to pay money for online school She shouldn't have chose to have me, I didn't want to be here anyways
throwaway2017sss	It wasn't directed to anything she did. I was going to sleep and she knew I was upset already. 
throwaway2017sss	No More of This | Mental illness not fun
throwaway2017sss	Thank you, I attend a workshop every Saturday but nothing other than that.  I don't have issues with social anxiety or social awkwardness, I just have delusional disorder which makes it difficult in a different way that's honestly harder to work through than social anxiety if it can be worked through at all.
throwaway2017sss	Since theres not an answer I'll say that twitter was having huge issues with people continually getting detected as spambots, for unknown reasons. I think its still happening.
throwaway2017sss	i aim to be so good at hiding that the only thing people can read through is the tiniest thing in the world 
throwaway2017sss	I have English as a first and dominant language! I grew up in the states but I spent a lot of time with grandparents and my mother speaks it.  I'm just getting started on learning to write Chinese in the past few months.
throwaway2017sss	Its not supposed to be tagged remorse, but tagged conflicted. I think it tagged it as remorse automatically because I put the word remorse in the post.  But thank you!
throwaway2017sss	Taishanese, aka. a language that almost no non-chinese people in America speak  The closest thing someone can learn is Cantonese, and even then Cantonese people have a rather difficult time understanding Taishan, which in itself has multiple regional dialects.
throwaway2017sss	While there is a hurricane maybe you can write out your goals for the session? So that you can talk about everything you need to when you get there
throwaway2017sss	It's okay to feel that way. Not sure if its a normal feeling.  some people just cant really function well in normal jobs and its okay.  I find it easier to be suicidal/depressed because I no longer have things i care about enough to spend money on (with a few exceptions) so im now much more responsible with my money now that the high of purchasing is gone. i used to shop daily now i only buy what i absolutely need (things that i can use to make money)
throwaway2017sss	hi
throwaway2017sss	yes for different reasons but they can't tell. im looking to go a little further than i am now hiding wise
throwaway2017sss	I've been in hospitals and the people there would stay for 1-3 weeks. Multiple hospitals
throwaway2017sss	I am sad and lonely everyday | Title says it all.
throwaway2017sss	I dont have it in me too be a good friend either :(
throwaway2017sss	I cant see the comments? But thanm you to both of you. Why cant i see you?
throwaway2017sss	Sports/Masculine stuff has nothign to do with gender, I'm trans and I have an own identity of hobbies that couldn't be boxed into a Male or Female category.  Some Cis guys like being sexy like that for fun. Like if a cis guy has girly legs they might show the legs off for fun. I've seen it. 
throwaway2017sss	Sad | i think about how embarassing and stupid and cringy i am a lot and want to just get rid of myself so that i dont have to be stupid anymore   whenever im outside and i listen to whats in my youtube history, I can't stop thinking about how stupid it is and how mentally slow i am and that I'm like a little kid and i have to resist the urge to scratch and draw blood  And when I shuffle through my playlist i remember how i played this one song to show off and i want to punch myself in the face  i wish my mom was one of those 'autisum moms' and that she would be the type of mom who got so fed up with her kid that she would kill them so that i wouldn't live knowing im an embarassment  so im sad
throwaway2017sss	[Conflicted] Started Yelling at People in Different Language | I used to yell/threaten people in English maybe once or twice a year.   I have learned that I can yell at people in a different language without getting in trouble. When someone upsets me very much I yell whatever I want at them. I even yell about unrelated things that are stressing me out.   This has relieved stress from me more than anything else. (Therapy adds stress.) Especially since I can't talk to people about things.  I felt bad the first time. Second time I felt no remorse.  I have yelled in my language 2 times in the past 3 months. In English I only yelled once every year or once every two years.
mentalexistential	After we eat the donuts we can "bup, bup, bup." You know...... "bup, bup, bup."
mentalexistential	Free for all. I think it's the laws we put in place that restrict what we kill. Otherwise there's no difference in my eyes.
mentalexistential	Thanks for explaining. 
mentalexistential	Could Google's Deep Mind AI help speed up transactions? | All we need is a powerful super computer to shoot BTC to the moon. 
mentalexistential	I don't know if bitcoin specifically will be the future. It will definitely be a crypto currency of some sort. It's like that thing people used to stamp on money to track their dollar bills.   "Where's George?"  Instead of voluntarily tracking every dollar, it becomes mandatory. Think about it. A fascist totalitarian's dream currency. Or the banks, corporations, illuminati.....Whoever runs the system we operate under now
mentalexistential	lol
mentalexistential	wow. thanks for the reply
mentalexistential	I think that is a byproduct of our social construct. The son of a cannibalistic tribal chief might have no qualms about killing someone for food. Let's ask.
mentalexistential	well then.....thanks
mentalexistential	So what is the meaning of life?
mentalexistential	So omnipotent could not turn itself into powerless by that same logic? Then what makes something omnipotent if there are limitations? 
mentalexistential	So it's ok to kill the unconscious ?
mentalexistential	Could God kill himself? | If there is a God, could he/she/it kill himself/herself/itself? What would happen next?
mentalexistential	Do you think there's a God? | If you do, do you think he/she/it has the power to kill himself/herself/itself? If that happened what would happen to all of us?
mentalexistential	I guess I was comparing to localized fiat currency, with cash in hand it's an instant transaction. But thanks for taking the time to explain the process. It makes sense on an international trading scale.
mentalexistential	Age slowly for about 100 more years. That's the most painful way I can think of.
mentalexistential	So you're saying that 10 minute wait is by design? How will people adopt bitcoin? People are so impatient nowadays.
mentalexistential	You sell pot for BTC?  I've seen pot used as money on the big island of Hawaii. People who would grow pot would buy groceries with pot. Barter system needs to come back. Fuck the banks
mentalexistential	That's a peculiar username? Do you believe/worship in Satan? Just curious
mentalexistential	computing power not relevant to a digital currency, got it.
mentalexistential	If 1BTC = $1,000,000USD then how much would a transaction fee cost in USD?
mentalexistential	Rule the world.
mentalexistential	What is the price we are willing to pay for knowledge? Destruction of humanity? | [removed]
mentalexistential	Are they looking for "doesnt" matter? Cause they should be.  
mentalexistential	Can Deep Mind help with the processing power of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? | If you are familiar with the processing requirements needed to process transactions within a cryptocurrency, do you think Deep Mind could help?
mentalexistential	Yes, too slow. But patience is required for revolution. This is why people will always be slaves to money. 
mentalexistential	Good question.....
mentalexistential	If only there were charities willing to accept bitcoin. Because ultimately charities will need banks. Banks hate bitcoin. Puts banks out of business.
mentalexistential	tldr 
mentalexistential	Are you kidding? The cost of a transaction fee?  Oh I get it. You're being sarcastic. Lol. You got me there
EricaLamb360	How a frightened one-eyed street dog found love | 
EricaLamb360	I'm trying to get in shape after the death of my Dad. I've gained a lot of weight due to comfort eating, but I'm now ready to try and find my fitness again. I'm currently training for a half-marathon. I'd love to hear from anyone else in a similar situation. | 
EricaLamb360	Having the courage to admit you have depression..... | Earlier this week Adam, an old school friend, posted a quote on Facebook about depression. I clicked onto his wall and noticed that there were a lot of posts about depression and mental health. Adam was clearly sharing some very personal insights and reaching out to others. As I got ready to start my day, I contemplated whether I could reach out to him and share my own voice. I found myself frozen. I didn't want to "like" his post - what is there to like about depression?  And yet at the same time I wanted to say something, but I couldn't. I closed my laptop and went to work, but over the course of the day I thought about what he had shared and I felt like a coward and a fraud. For three months my personal world had been falling apart after the death of my Dad, every day I felt struck by the pain of his loss and yet I was pretending that everything was OK when really it wasn't.  This post is to thank Adam for giving me the courage to acknowledge my depression and just to let others know - you are not alone.   https://www.mindwave.ky/single-post/2017/09/11/Mental-Health-matters

EricaLamb360	My brother had lots of issues with his posture. He spent a week or so really looking at how he used his body - having that awareness made a big difference. https://www.mindwave.ky/single-post/2017/09/11/Are-patterns-in-your-posture-causing-you-back-pain
EricaLamb360	Hi! I'm thinking you've probably got the advice you need, but really trying to work on your posture might help. https://www.mindwave.ky/single-post/2017/09/11/How-to-improve-your-body-alignment
EricaLamb360	This is too much fun! I love what you've done. The moustache, the beard, the song choice! Bonkersly brilliant! 
EricaLamb360	Are patterns in your posture causing you back pain? I wrote this article for my brother and it's really helped him improve his posture. | 
EricaLamb360	I'm a 32DD and I've learnt that it's well worth investing in a good sports bra that keeps your boobs firmly in place! You don't want any friction going on. One thing I always have in my running belt is a little sponge. I live in the Caribbean and I run half-marathons and the heat is a real factor for me sometimes. I've found that my little sponge has become an essential for cooling me down. Good luck with the full marathon! 
EricaLamb360	Love your enthusiasm for Yoga! I've been practising for twenty years and it brings me so much joy. One thing I'd say is be gentle with your body, if a pose is too difficult ask your yoga teacher how you could adapt it. It's good to go to your edge, but it's super important not to injure yourself.  
EricaLamb360	I'm a school teacher with wonky shoulders from always carrying my heavy bags on my right shoulder! Not sure if this article will help you, but I was trying to put together some suggestions for my brother who was having a lot of back issues.

EricaLamb360	100 Brilliant Things To Live For | [removed]
EricaLamb360	It's an online course with a wonderful lady called Shelley Klammer. Here's a link to her website: https://www.expressiveartworkshops.com/expressive-art-e-courses/100-days-of-art-journal-therapy/
EricaLamb360	Lots of good advice already in the thread, but I'd agree drinking lots of water as a number 1. I also found warm drinks like Peppermint Tea or Green Tea soothed my tummy when it rumbled! I also kept a tub full of chopped celery and radishes so I could "snack" to my heart's content. Good luck!   
EricaLamb360	I'm not sure if it's something you'd like but after my Dad died I crafted a book about him with collages and artwork and song lyrics etc. It was very celebratory and made up of all the things he loved and enjoyed. I'd spend hours on a page cutting out images from gardening magazines, old recipe books etc. The process of creating was very soothing and the finished book is a huge source of comfort when I'm feeling down. I also went for counselling and that helped me empty out a lot of the pain. Be kind to yourself though. It's her birthday and that is always going to bring back a mixture of memories. x  
EricaLamb360	Thanks for all your positive comments tinytownfemme x
EricaLamb360	I'm reading through all these wonderful replies and I am feeling so comforted. I confess when I got in from work this evening I wasn't feeling too inspired. The heaviness and the slowness can sit like a bit of a fog. I'm going to finish replying to all the kindnesses and then I am going to make myself jog/walk too. Thank-you for the inspiration. x
EricaLamb360	Thanks for sharing this. It sounds really helpful. x
EricaLamb360	My brother said he felt as though he needed to live life in a bigger way to try and get over the pain of Dad, kind of what you've said. I came across this quote that kind of sums it up: "Grief is like the ocean, it comes in waves, ebbing and flowing. Sometimes the water is calm, and sometimes it is overwhelming. All we can do is learn to swim." x
EricaLamb360	I so get this. Life suddenly feels very precious. I've been struggling with some of the more destructive feelings that have come with grief and the feeling that he'd be so mad at me for all the tears and pain. I feel as though I'm getting through though and he'd be the first to say get out there and do it. No excuses. x  
EricaLamb360	Thanks for the kindness and encouragement. x
EricaLamb360	Thank-you for your understanding and encouraging words. It's hard isn't it? I'm doing so much better but I don't think I'll ever be quite the same and I agree you can't ever quite know what will set you back. Stay strong too with sports and positivity. x
EricaLamb360	Apologies tasteofglycerine I understand. Can I just say how hugely appreciative I am though of all the wonderful people who commented on my post. 
EricaLamb360	Sending you lots of love. I can imagine that you must have a lot of mixed feelings about a sport that I'm guessing he enjoyed very much. I think those first weeks of heartbreak were the hardest for me and it felt as though I would never be myself again. Hang in there and take things one day at a time. x
EricaLamb360	Sending much love to you too. It's so hard losing special, hugely loved parents. I've never been a big drinker but I just took solace in glasses of wine and a lot of comforting eating too. One day I looked in the mirror and saw this wretched face - so pale and ill-looking and I knew I couldn't carry on hurting myself. I actually went for counselling and this summer I spent a lot of time with my family remembering happy times with Dad. It has helped a lot and I'm glad that I'm now trying to look after my fitness. Here's to endorphins! x  
EricaLamb360	Thank-you for your kind words. Grief is a definitely a tough time. Hoping we can both get back on track. I feel as though Dad would want me to look after myself. x

EricaLamb360	Maybe you could do something special to celebrate/remember your Mom. Was there a certain meal she enjoyed or special place you could go to? It might help you to feel close to her and not so empty. 
EricaLamb360	Sending you lots of doggy hugs. She sounds like a very special one.
EricaLamb360	Cuteness!
EricaLamb360	My Dad died in February and over the summer I created a book of collages, tributes and memories as a way of spending time with him. It helped me so much on my healing journey and it became such an important way for me to express all the joy that he brought into my life. | 
EricaLamb360	You look great. Well done.
EricaLamb360	I'm guessing you are probably sorted but I'm currently enjoying 100 days of art therapy and I'm doing a lot of collaging. Some funky scissors and a tin of spray glue with an arty magazine would be some items that I would appreciate!
EricaLamb360	Who makes you smile? Are you a ray of sunshine? | Every morning as I drive to work there's a man who runs a little corner shop who often catches my eye. I've never actually spoken to this man but his smile is contagious and he will often raise his hand and wave at me as I drive past. After two or three months of his joyousness I stopped nodding at him politely and started waving back with a similar level of enthusiasm. He has actually become something of a ray of sunshine in my life. I don't know his name. I don't even know what he sells in his shop. But I do know that he makes me smile.  Today was my last day of work. For the last time I drove the route home past his corner shop but this time I stopped my car. He came scurrying over to greet me with his usual enthusiasm and shook my hand warmly. I smiled at him and said "Thank-you for making me smile every day. You are like a ray of sunshine on my drive to work." He looked a bit embarrassed, but I carried on. "It's my last day driving this route to work, but I wanted to stop and let you know that you have lifted my spirits every day." We shook hands. We smiled at each other and then I drove off in my car.  Maybe there's a ray of sunshine looking out for you as you commute to work, maybe there's a ray of sunshine in the supermarket working as a cashier or maybe YOU are the ray of sunshine who needs to brighten up someone else's day! #50daysofniceness  http://spice-of-life-360.blogspot.com/2017/06/who-makes-you-smile-are-you-ray-of.html

EricaLamb360	:0) It is a bit ridiculously beautiful! 
EricaLamb360	Is your posture getting you down? | I recently attended a yoga workshop where we really focused on our posture. We consciously spent time exploring how we carried ourselves and I can honestly say it's made me think a lot more about the relationship between my well-being and my posture.   So often we are caught up in our day to day chores, our jobs, our family responsibilities etc.; we forget about our bodies. We rely on them to function efficiently and effectively, but we often neglect them for long periods, without any kind of attention and I think this can impact on our wellbeing. Slumped in a chair? Hunched over a computer? Curled up in bed? I think how we carry our bodies can contribute to our relationship with depression.   I wrote a blog article about this in relation to my brother's back ache, but I genuinely think an awareness of our posture can help us with our mental-health too. Any thoughts?  http://spice-of-life-360.blogspot.com/2017/05/patterns-in-your-posture.html

EricaLamb360	A Dog's Tale - How one stray dog found the Best Home | Last week I met with my wonderful friend Adrianna and her two dogs Lucky and Donny, I was amazed to see the change in Donny, he's come such a long way in such a short time. This is his story:  My name is Donny. I am a black and white border collie mix and I grew up a stray. Nobody wanted me. I quickly learned to keep away from humans. I got badly kicked by a man one day and there were a few times when kids would throw stones at me.  In the summer of 2014 I found a quiet neighbourhood and took to hanging out with some other stray dogs. There was safety in numbers, but sometimes things got rough. I was kind of bottom of the pack. I guess I was just a frightened youngster and timid too.  Whilst on the streets I noticed this kind looking lady. She had a little male dog that she called Lucky. I used to see her with Lucky and I wished that I could be owned and loved like that. Sometimes the lady made a move to approach me, but I would run away. I was too scared to trust. Too scared of getting hurt. But despite my fears, I kind of took to following the lady when she was out on her walks. I always kept my distance, but I knew she noticed me and I loved the way the little dog looked at her. He was always wagging his tail and the way she petted him, it made me think that perhaps some humans were OK.  On September 6th 2014 I followed the lady further than usual and then I guess a scent wafted towards my nose. I was always on the look-out for food. I was always hungry. I figure I wasn’t really paying attention. I knew about the road and I knew about the cars, but that morning I was just too preoccupied. The car came out of the blue. It hit me hard. I remember everything in a blur and then the most excruciating pain in my right eye.  I recalled the car driving off at speed and the sound of my own whimpering howl. I fled in terror.  Time seemed to stand still and minutes turned into hours. My whole body ached and I couldn’t see through my injured eye. I lay licking my paws and trying to find comfort. Then I remember seeing the lady’s concerned face with my one good eye.  She had a man with her from the Department of Agriculture and although I was afraid, I felt too weak to even try to escape. I let them take me.  They took me for urgent medical attention and the vet told the lady that miraculously my only injury was an eye trauma from that initial impact. The vet said that the eye would need surgery and that it was an expensive procedure. The vet said it probably made more sense to put me down since I was a stray. The lady looked at me and she said “No, I can’t let that happen.” She looked at me with the same love that she always gave to the little dog. Although I was terrified I somehow knew this lady would keep me safe and she did.  It’s been over two years since the lady rescued me and I’ve never looked back. An awesome charity called C.A.R.E. assisted with my medical care and I made it through the surgery in one piece. Every day I got a bit stronger both physically and emotionally. The lady was so kind and gentle and it wasn’t long before Lucky and me became like brothers. The lady even convinced me to start walking on a leash. She tells me I’m a loyal and loving dog. Although I’m still a bit wary of strangers, the lady has taught me that not all humans wish me harm.  Thank-you to my beautiful friend Adrianna for making a difference.  http://spice-of-life-360.blogspot.com/2017/05/a-dogs-tale.html
EricaLamb360	http://spice-of-life-360.blogspot.com/2017/05/50-days-of-niceness.html?m=1  I came up with the above list for the very same reason. 50 days of niceness helps me get out of my mind and focus on other things. Take care of yourself and may the nicenesses help you get through. 
EricaLamb360	I will. She is a very wonderful lady and Donny is so loved. She has transformed him into such a happy and loved dog. :0) 
EricaLamb360	This looks great. It's great to get information on the different types of meditation. This is something I need to explore more.
EricaLamb360	Sending love. Everyone's journey through grief is unique but I can relate to you. I lost my Dad, grandmother and uncle over a period of four months and it's been hard. I try and take each day as it comes but some days it all gets a bit overwhelming. Take time to look after yourself. 
EricaLamb360	Yay! So happy for you! My sister's cat disappeared over a year ago and they were gutted because she never came back.   If only they could tell you their tale.
EricaLamb360	I'm doing my Yoga teacher training and working on some ideas for meditation. Any feedback much appreciated. | 
EricaLamb360	These are great for meditation. Would love to know how you get such great sounds. I'm a total amateur on the sound recording front (using an old microphone and Audacity) but I enjoy making simple guided meditation videos for my yoga classes. Your creations are great. Any top tips for a novice gratefully received.

EricaLamb360	I've been using Calm for about 18 months but I'm keen to hear a new voice. I've found a lot of great free meditation videos on YouTube. Jason Stephenson is my current favourite! 
EricaLamb360	That dirty little secret that keeps me awake at night..... | [removed]
sexyfuckingwizard	I don't if I'm depressed | But I feel sad pretty much all the time and sometimes I cry for seemingly no reason or just over something really small. I'm too scared to go to a doctor and I don't have anyone to talk to and it's starting to get really frustrating just going through the same self hating thoughts over and over again and doing nothing about it.
sexyfuckingwizard	It's four F's
sexyfuckingwizard	The actor?
sexyfuckingwizard	I gotta get a dog
sexyfuckingwizard	What does this have to do with tom cruise?
sexyfuckingwizard	Yes
sexyfuckingwizard	I fucking hate whenever people pretend there's outrage over something like this just so they can have the moral high crowd
sexyfuckingwizard	Sounds a lot like obama
sexyfuckingwizard	Well that's seems like a perfectly reasonable response
sexyfuckingwizard	Why?
sexyfuckingwizard	What exactly is a mental midget?
sexyfuckingwizard	If you support taxes then what the hell are you doing here?
sexyfuckingwizard	And how does the government taking money that you earned not an infringement on your rights?
sexyfuckingwizard	Why is it that whenever leftists are challenged on their beliefs they never actually defend their beliefs they just insult you?
sexyfuckingwizard	Libertarianism in Ireland | I'm from Ireland and I have recently started to consider myself a libertarian but I don't really know of any political party or movement that I could align myself with. So my question is does anyone know of a libertarian or similar movement that exists here?
sexyfuckingwizard	That's disappointing
sexyfuckingwizard	He makes a good point
sexyfuckingwizard	It would still suck
sexyfuckingwizard	Communism
sexyfuckingwizard	It's reddit, what do you think?
sexyfuckingwizard	The front page of reddit is definitely liberal
sexyfuckingwizard	That's not on the front page though
sexyfuckingwizard	What?
sexyfuckingwizard	Well I assume someone would be more willing to hire someone who is willing to work for less momey
sexyfuckingwizard	Question about the minimum wage | This is a somewhat random and poorly thought out question but I was just wondering is it legal to work for less than minimum wage in Ireland if you want to?
sexyfuckingwizard	But if businesses can't afford to pay people minimum wage then there not going to hire them at all
sexyfuckingwizard	But it seems ridiculous to me that if someone is willing to work for less money , they are legally not allowed to do so
sexyfuckingwizard	Fat tony
sexyfuckingwizard	I'm pretty sure choi is a host
sexyfuckingwizard	Sweet combat roll
sexyfuckingwizard	I'm glad I stayed up for this card
sexyfuckingwizard	I don't like the lack of commentary during these walk outs
sexyfuckingwizard	Take a point
sexyfuckingwizard	Where the fuck did that come from?
sexyfuckingwizard	Holy shit
sexyfuckingwizard	Is that drake?
sexyfuckingwizard	"Flawless victory" This isn't mortal kombat
sexyfuckingwizard	Seems like a nice guy
sexyfuckingwizard	I want to see him as young Robert baratheon. " bow before your king, bow you shits"
sexyfuckingwizard	Man there were some awful stoppages in there
sexyfuckingwizard	Was the Conor fight the last fight he lost?
sexyfuckingwizard	Okay I will go
sexyfuckingwizard	Fook Mark Wahlberg 
sexyfuckingwizard	When you put it like that it sounds terrifying
sexyfuckingwizard	Can someone tell me when miesha has done analysis?
sexyfuckingwizard	Yeah fuck him for following his passion right?
sexyfuckingwizard	You knock out the light weight champion without taking any damage
sexyfuckingwizard	Call me when he beats Fedor 
sexyfuckingwizard	I meant conor
sexyfuckingwizard	Nobody calls me chicken biff
sexyfuckingwizard	Link please? 
sexyfuckingwizard	I love Joanna talking shit in Polish, it just makes it so much more genuine for me.
sexyfuckingwizard	CONOR MCGREGOR WOULD DESTROY TYRON WOODLEY
sexyfuckingwizard	Found Mike Perry's corner man
Cubsfan5ever	I'm so in my own head it's ruining me | My self talk is so negative and toxic it's ruining any chance for me to become happy. Last night for example I was out at the bars with my friends and I just saw how happy everyone was and how much fun they were having and I was telling myself I should be able to be like that. And then the self talk became "why aren't you more like that?" I feel like I've got a broken brain. I ended up leaving early and on the way back I was mad at myself for leaving. I'm holding myself back with my own negativity and I don't know how to beat it. I just had to get this down somewhere so I don't accidentally say it out loud to someone and really embarrass myself. Thanks
Cubsfan5ever	Was also the highest game score in a finals game until Lebron passed it in game 6 last year

Cubsfan5ever	Haha I want to die | 
Cubsfan5ever	NBA seems to be the only woke sports league
Cubsfan5ever	Thank you for this!
Cubsfan5ever	I was specifying an an output file location like you have there and closing at the end. I suppose a better way to put it would be I don't want to have the "All your code..." part I want to have a part of the code like "procedure A" then not some procedure "procedure B" and then have "procedure C" in the same document with procedure A
Cubsfan5ever	Imagine telling the players on the 1935 Cubs at the time that their win streak record still stands in the far off year of 2017
Cubsfan5ever	Help with ODS | I've been struggling for 3 hours trying to get the right parts of my output in an rtf file. I've either been able to get the entirety of my output or just bits and pieces that aren't enough. I'm not really sure if this question makes sense. I've tried using ods rtf; at the beginning of each step, at the end. I've tried using ods rtf; at the beginning of a procedure and then ods rtf close; at the end. I've tried using ods trace on and off around the parts I want. None of it is working for me.

Cubsfan5ever	I don't get why you're talking about the best show of all time and then naming all these shows that aren't the Sopranos 
Cubsfan5ever	Oh god pizza the hutt. Literally nothing has ever grossed me out more than pizza the hutt
Cubsfan5ever	Honestly a total collapse where literally the fucking Brewers get in ahead of them might actually motivate them again for next season. They just don't look like they have it this year. Anything can happen come playoff team but I just don't see it in them
Cubsfan5ever	Agreed. #ExtendGarPax
Cubsfan5ever	And yet a smaller percentage of Sanders voters went to Trump than Clinton voters to McCain in 08. By a lot. And Obama managed to win by a ridiculous margin. It's not Sanders or his supporters fault that they ran a shit campaign

Cubsfan5ever	What if the Cubs could win a dang baseball game against the team right behind them in the standings 😎
Cubsfan5ever	Have the Cubs had a stretch at any point this year where both the pitching and the hitting were doing well at the same time?
Cubsfan5ever	You won't convince people here to wait and see. Many here already consider Doncic a star
Cubsfan5ever	How come the Cubs don't score some more runs
Cubsfan5ever	Exactly the guy you want up to bat in this situation 
Cubsfan5ever	One thing that is great to have happen is when your MVP drops 40 RBI's off his last year's pace. It's good to me
Cubsfan5ever	Bears are going to win. Super Bowl loser hangover is real
Cubsfan5ever	Willy be back
Cubsfan5ever	What I think it really was was that a lot of people, media included, who watched the Warriors every game that year and saw Steph going god mode could tell that even in the famous "I'm back!" Portland game Curry really was not himself
Cubsfan5ever	You gotta think James Harden is in there somewhere
Cubsfan5ever	Jason Mantzoukas is a god tho

Cubsfan5ever	Well what was the quote
Cubsfan5ever	I'm trying to catch up on it. I watched the first two episodes of the return after only seeing the original premiere episode. I've since seen the first season and the season 2 premiere. I've gotten side tracked in my tv watching though and definitely did not catch up in time to be in on the hype
Forthjort	but i have no future, for i have no future.
Forthjort	give me one reason why i shouldnt cut my throat open | no one desires me, i am a living joke.  and no one hides that from me.  I am so angry...
Forthjort	I wanted to prove to myself if god was real tonight... | and I found peace with it.  I found an inner calm and ease from wanting to end it all. I dont know why I didnt, but I had made my peace with it...
Forthjort	I just got one, it makes me convulse as it keeps vibrating on the prostate, it will make you shiver.
Forthjort	I recently bought a toy that vibrates my prostate, my goodness! | [removed]
Forthjort	Any tablet friendly sites for flash hentai? | Tried opening funny games, all that happened was that i redirected all over the place to unsavory sites.  I just want some interactive flash touching games on my tablet...
Forthjort	how easily could you infiltrate isis by acting like you are a convert? | 
Forthjort	I might be an alcoholic, but then again maybe not. I dont have to drink, I just love the flavor of it.
Forthjort	when I was a small child, I saw just a shadowy silhouette of myself in the mirror instead of actually myself.
Forthjort	[Serious] Where do I go on reddit to find a place to ask super simple questions and get quick and simple answers? | [removed]
Forthjort	What is the most fanservicey character out there in your opinion? | 
Forthjort	the reason why I want to do art, is to recreate the same feeling in others. | I want other generations to experience what I did. and I want them to enjoy the same feelings I did.  
Forthjort	Herd Gnarr! | Herd Gnarr, a great, fun little token lover.  run the aura that pops 2 1/1 tokens and grants trample, or maybe a bounce deck?  What sort of potential does Herd Gnarr have in your opinion?
Forthjort	I am lost... what are 30 somethings even supposed to do with their lives anymore? | its all about the 20 year olds, the sexy young people... I am so lost.  
Forthjort	sounds... fascinating.
Forthjort	well, could you help me find a none vague answer?
Forthjort	Sorry, its due to me having absolutely no idea what to do with my life.  I started five years later than everyone else with College, and I have no idea what to do with myself.
Forthjort	Inattentive type ADHDer here, got any good ideas for what I can do with myself? | [removed]
Forthjort	I have been bored for my entire life... | And I dont know how to get out of that funk.  Hell im so hung up on things I cant control, I cant stand it!
Forthjort	Can I even find any hope in life? | Gods not real.  My mind is a shattered realm of glass.  My family cracked.  My interests gone to shit.  Do I even love my girlfriend?
Forthjort	I want to do some anal prostate stimulation, any good and cheap ideas for me to use? | Like what sort of stuff can I buy at the local supermarket to do this?  Condom, Carrot and lube? Toothbrush? Just a finger? and how do you prep for the least spillage?
Forthjort	Sorry, wrote in a beer and sleepless stupor, what I meant is basically tiring exercise and eating painfully spicy foods.
Forthjort	I like feeling feminine, but im a 1.90 straight man | Dont really like wearing dresses either, love wearing fishnet though.  I love feeling water on my skin, I love things against my skin, slow moving enjoyment...  I dont like masculine except for situations where I eat spicy foods or walk far.
Forthjort	How do I stop being so useless? | I am not gonna beat around the bush, I suck.  Ive spent my life in front of a tv or computer screen for the most part, im a hard gainer (skinny), and I am terrified of failing.  I dont even know where to start here in life, I want to start again.
Forthjort	Do I have to know what I want? | Maybe its a trap?  Maybe its pointless to be hung up on that? Maybe I am wasting my time thinking about it? then why do I want to find the answer? I have nothing, and I am always bored.  I am always somwhere where I am always so damned bored.  I only live online, for it is the only place I can sort of live.
Forthjort	I have nothing to lose | I have nothing in this world.  I am not bound beyond that of a rent contract which I can drop at any time.  I have the equivalent to 4500 dollars in the bank, barely any real valuables...  I could leave.
Forthjort	Not around here, I probably need to leave come to think of it.
Forthjort	As in, you are given a task to be completed within a certain time, and you get payed for when its finished.
Forthjort	What sort of jobs pay you by the assignment and not the hour? | 
Forthjort	I can only be truly honest online, with strangers. | Irl, I am an outgoing guy, I am open about myself, I am like an open book, but, the things I truly carry around, deep inside, the things I seriously carry around, are things I can only share anonymously online.  Fuck me, I am just not happy.  I am not even certain if I like my relationship, I dont know what I want, fuck, I want to leave everything I know behind, my braindamaged mother, my neurotic brother and his druggy girlfriend...  I want to spend my savings on running away, somewhere where no one knows me, start a really regular and low key job somewhere, change my name.  it sounds so... freeing.
Forthjort	I revel in being "weak". | its a pain when I meet self righteous pricks who cant stand that I enjoy being sensitive, but beyond that, its great.  I much more easily enjoy flavors of foods, I feel minute sensations like small waves in water or each blade of grass against my skin.  I dont understand why this is viewed as a bad thing? there are plenty of strong people in the world, strong people that can do the job of tough guy, but me? im not wired like that, I am not like that at all, and I enjoy it, and if anything I wish to use it to help others, seeing how I can much more easily understand other peoples emotions.  Be the tough guy out there, then I will take care of you afterwards, thats how I'd like it, entertain you, listen to you, or heck, just sit in silence and watch the game with you if you just need a friend.  I hate being made into some sort of weakling, or self rightous person, or ignorant. I am not, I am a nice guy, and I just want to be nice, and no, not the fedora wearing kind, the real kind, the kind that will not assume things as much as possible.  I just wish to be that person you know? and I want to e accepted for that, the nice guy you can talk to when you are unhappy, and I will not share anything with anyone.  I always wanted to be a psychologist, but, my nerves got too broken when I grew up, thanks to others of my own age just not liking me, and treating me like dirt.  I am a community person, not a conquer person. I am just human, never cared for any "gender identity" whatever that means, the only identity I want is mine, its special to me, and those that are in my life. this sounds very special snowflaky, right? I dont believe its wrong to feel like that, as long as you use it to better life around you and give yourself a better quality of life, dont take away from others because its all about you, seek rather sharing it when you have it, and those that would share it with you the same way.  wow, this got preachy quick.  look, I just want to feel happy about who I am.    Is this wrong?
Forthjort	I am terribly burned out artistically, and have no idea how to get my mojo back... | got any good ideas as to how to do so? I need my mojo back, I wanna paint as I used to.
Forthjort	btw, know anything similar?
Forthjort	I love these games... | 
Forthjort	I dunno, I just think it would be weird to be submissive. | I am bicurious, but the stuff that makes me fight off the ideas is that I dont like being submissive, even though I want to be.  As if I am a lesser person for it.
Forthjort	im just having problems with it, I just view this as a possibility to be a bit femenine when with guys, but with women masculine.  I guess I just have an issue with being the submissive one seeing how I grew up in hicksville. guys treating me badly for being sensitive, and I want to be submissive towards some other guys?
Forthjort	I think I might be bisexual, but... | I am only open to the idea when I am drunk or really sleepy.  I grew up in a rural town, the place made fun of homosexuals so much that it became a negative thing in my mind if I cwould commit such acts.  that, and my recently braindamaged mother has exclaimed that she is so happy for the fact that I am not gay (she had three strokes as a result of smoking, it sucks big time, my future kids will never have a proper grandma on my side, amongst a slew of other things...).  I dunno, I like feeling sensitive and feminine, not so much that I wanna wear a dress, but enough to be sensitive. its so wonderful, and I wanna just make love with anyone. well, I WOULD before meeting my current girlfriend, wonderful woman, just catholic, hates homosexuality as well...  I dunno, what do you think, am I just sexually frustrated, or is there something more to me that is just not coming to light?  I wanna be with women, but when my inhibitions are gone, I want to be with men as well... just sensual lust in general...
Forthjort	ooh fuck i love this guys work...
Forthjort	I am currently drunk, just so thats out there. drunk enough to say enough without getting too much in detail.
Forthjort	Dont expect a perfect answer, just opinions.  Proper truth can only be found my me, and no one else.  But I did flirt very involuntarily towards a very girly boy I met once, but I reacted badly to my actions towards him.  Im just horny though, I wanna enjoy all of it, I am truly a hedonist, a careful one sure, but definatly a hedonist.  my girlfriend is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life, she is cute, wonderful, loving... she is just amazing, except for her negative reactions towards those of "not proper sexuality".  I love her, and she loves me...  I dunno, maybe its just lust, its such a damned chaos in my mind...  Ya rlyeh, cthulhu ftaghn.
Forthjort	can you guys recommend some good erotic comics that is not hentai? | [removed]
Forthjort	[Serious] If you were to make your own job, how would you do it? | 
Forthjort	Is there a squeezing practice? | as in being really tightly squeezed in leather or under something?
Forthjort	oh? what would that be?
Forthjort	this is good!
Forthjort	I dont care anymore, how do I get rich? | I dont care about scruples or whatever anymore, I just wanna get rich, any ideas?  Im angry, i am hurt, I am furious, and I just want to use the world for what it is.
Forthjort	I just want to get rich, how do i do so? | Its ok, this is a throwaway account, so I just act out my darker sides...  What can I do, to just become rich, no scruples, no worries, just using and abusing others?
Forthjort	I dont feel it when my girlfriend licks my dick, Am I not very sensitive down there? | I dont get it, I can barely feel blowjobs, what can be the reason? its the same as intercourse, though we use condoms I can barely feel anything beyond reaching climax (as in I dont feel the build up before reaching the "final stretch" and climax)
Forthjort	I dont want to have emtions anymore. | I am so done, I want to be a machine the rest o my existence...  Everything just hurts...
Forthjort	I am lazy, but I want to be motivated, can I have some inspiration? | [removed]
Forthjort	[Text] How do I stay motivated when I am terrified of failing? | I was heavily mentally tortured by some guys in high school whenever I failed at something, and now its very hard for me to keep going when I fail.  I used to be very good at failing and learning, but they made it so that I cant take failure, and I am so terrified of failure now that I never keep going anymore.  please, can you help me? I was mentally programmed to only feel failure and view myself as a loser whenever I failed. 
Forthjort	I have never gotten an answer for this and it is destroying my life. | No one understands me whenever I say this, but I will try again, so that maybe I can get an answer.  My brain can completely change its mind when I say something, do something or opposite of that, my mind just loves to change its interests the second I want to do something.  Like, lets say I want to contiously date someone, but then I suddenly feel a giant feeling of regret, only to want it again when I dont have it I do want it.  Sounds classic, sure, but heres something more for you, I have experienced realizing that I did not understand a school assignment, only to understand it the second I give up on it, but if I say I am good at something, I suddenly dont get good at it, I fail at it for some reason...  I am so done with this, I am so confused with myself, with who I am, I dont know anymore...
Forthjort	[text] (semi rant) Its hard to feel motivated, when motivation usually takes the form of one thing. | [removed]
Forthjort	[Condoms] I recently found out my penis is a bit too thick for regular condoms, any good tips for what to look for? | I have an avarage length, but my girth is so thick that regular condoms might be a bit too skinny, I get a red ring from it being too tight on there, is that normal? they hurt like heck...  Any good tips for what to look for?
Forthjort	Jst found ot my penis is slightly too thick for regular condoms, any good size tips friends? | [removed]
Forthjort	Look away you of weak hearts. | [removed]
Forthjort	The kind of guys I like... | I dont like the whole tough guy personality, I just cant stand it, the whole "macho" schtick, but, I do like some petite guys, or skinny and freindly guys...  I am not willing to be with a guy who is kind of a jerk, but I do want to be a sub for a nice big guy, or be the nice tough guy with a sweet petite guy... I like girly boys, or friendly giants.  I dunno why I want to say that, I guess I did it for me...
Forthjort	are there any soft ones?
Forthjort	I want things that vibrate, things that take me for a ride without me having to do anything.
Forthjort	I am so sorry, I will edit my text right away. I am norwegian, and my price range is 200 to 800 nok. I am short but thick on the front, and I can take medium-small back there.
Forthjort	got any good ideas for what the prices could range within? I dont mean to be a bother, I just dont like loosing money over trivial things...
Forthjort	good observation, I should take these things you guys into account next time.  I didnt see the seam before after I bought the thing, so I bet its probably going to be painful if I use it more than once or twice... We will see, I will get back to you once I've tested them.
Forthjort	Norway is the country toys are expensive here... like the rock off thing is more like 650 nok, which roughly translates to 73 bucks, without shipping, so you see why I am looking for the cheap stuff. I wasted cash on the stuff I bought, so should I just throw it out when I get it? probably unwise to use it now. I will post a short review of the stuff when it arrives though.
Forthjort	would these be considered unsafe? http://babystep.com.ua/images/stories/virtuemart/product/jordan-individual-dantu-sepetelis-didele-galvute-minkstas-1-vnt-1.jpg
Forthjort	I know, thats why the brushes head works well to stop the toothbrush.
Forthjort	not really what i meant, its in my feed at ebay, not ads... 
Forthjort	I am terrified of the gay part of bisexuality. | I am scared of being gay, and I dont know why, I am just not comfortable with it...  How or what do I do about that?  I am certain I am bi, my body goes numb when im with smeone else of the opposite sex, but I also like feeling femenine in the arms of a guy... but I am terrified and unwilling to take the step.  Heres t hoping it helps posting greivances online.  I wish sexuality could just be sexuality, and not something that is needlessly complex, almost wish I was a bonobo...
Forthjort	Butt stuff, that and really slow moving stuff.
Forthjort	how should I approach women on tinder? | I dont know, how do I do that? How am I not "creepy"? I get not being all pervy, but how do I show that I am into them without being either creepy or pervy?
Forthjort	you dont understand me, let me try to explain;  All the women I meet that I get truly well along with, women who not only laugh at my corny jokes, and likes spending time with me, but they always end up being already taken, all those that fit me have boyfriends.  the lesbian was kind of inbetween, she was not certain yet. I appearantly made her certain.  My life is kind of a bad comedy when it comes to it, the girls I like are either in a relationship, gay or just like me as a friend.  and when I hit the barscene, I dont know what to do either, guys act like asshats, guys say corny stuff, they meet women. I talk to women, they are smiling and laughing with me, then runs of and talks to someone else.  It is getting very frustrating you must understand?  And, I hope you are not reading this as me being angry, read it as I am telling it as a stand up, because it just baffles me this whole thing.
Forthjort	IM not hitting on them, I am merely stating that the ones that I get along with well are usually already spoken for. So, I have no way to find someone that likes me for me, because there are always someone or something, it is usually a guy, or this summer it was a girl that ended up being gay.
Forthjort	The women I usually get along with as myself are those that already has someone...
Forthjort	Do women like it when I say cutesy or corny stuff, or is that too much? | [removed]
Forthjort	where else would I post this then? Not coming from an agressive place, I am just seriously asking. :)
Forthjort	Exactly what I meant.  I feel oftenthis is one of the reasons why its hard for us to meet, because we have to force ourselves into being someone we are not, and as such alianate each other from ourselves, its really stupid in my opinion.
Forthjort	I dont know how to fraze this as a proper question you are asking for, care to help me out?
Forthjort	you know, I always felt that women make themselves more different from men? | [removed]
Forthjort	I just like being felt up in any way... | I like being sensual, it does not matter to me, penis, vagina, as long as they like me and rub themselves on me in a sensual manner, and none of that wam bam stuff, but the slow and calm type, I love having someone just embrace me, kiss me, hold me...  yeah, im bisexual.  but, how do I even explore it?
Forthjort	no good places like that around here I am afraid...
Forthjort	I dont know what to do in a big social gathering, like a club or anywhere where I might meet people. | I get very awkward before I have had a few beers, I just dont loosen up when it comes to hanging out at watering holes and such.  I just dont feel at ease in a crowd like that, I dont mind standing on stage and talking to people there, and I know when to hang out with people I know, but I just dont know what to talk about, what to break the ice with, what to do in general.  Please, any good answers? I only get along well with people who I feel understand me, and places like that are just so superficial?  This stuff is just in the way for me to meet someone, it is hard trying to get to know people who are so... typical? I guess?
Forthjort	I probably am bisexual, but I dont find everyone attractive? | I am attracted mostly towards women, but I have had not really crushes, but found other guys attractive.  I dont find everyone attractive, just those that I get close to and enjoy their company.  I dunno, maybe I am just a bit lonely? But there was this time a drunk dude kissed my cheek, and I liked it, I like the softness of a womans lips, but also the somewhat chapped and hard lips of a guy.  But I have never really been with a guy, and I am terrified of even saying that I am bisexual. I am just afraid of being wrong about this.
Forthjort	why does reality even exist? | [removed]
Forthjort	I dont mind getting to hear your views, yeah.
Forthjort	the fact that I can touch my self, the fact that I am aware, I guess my basis is "i think, therefore I am"
Forthjort	I dont set goals, I just keep going.
Forthjort	they should be wrapped in vacuum sealed packages, to keep them nice and fresh!
Forthjort	Really big issue I have! | I have a big problem whenever I excercise, I am pumped to train and get healthy as possible, but whenever I get exhausted (you know when you have that pain in your stomach and a taste of blood in your mouth?)  Whenever I reach that, I feel a strong sense of failure and worthlessness, to such a level that it gets really hard to continue.   I start to compare myself with everyone else, and that I am wasting my time doing it, even though I am doing it for myself...  I need some help here, and I guess it seemed like the right choice to ask here, maybe some of you can help me with some good words of motivation?  I am not kidding, its the kind of bad and heart breaking anxiety attack that stops you in your tracks.  I just want it gone, I want to have it leave so that I can push myself without interruptions.  Thanks.
Forthjort	over a year.  if it helps, I have felt this way since I was a child, since gym when all the kids would just run circles around me, when they finished the 100 meter dash within 20 seconds, I would use 02:30 minutes...
Forthjort	thank you kind sir, that is going to help my research something fierce ;)
Forthjort	sure, shoot, giimme the western stuff!
Forthjort	but in manga it usually this happens as well, only it is written.  the best take on this is zone sama's work, and other artists that are similar to him.
Forthjort	request, kinda, its based upon an annoyance I have. | [removed]
Forthjort	uhm... how do I tell if someone is into me? | and, I dont know how to approach women in a romantic manner, i easily make friends with people, but nothing else?
Forthjort	Any POV where you are the Sub? | What can I say, i like being taken care of...
Forthjort	what do you mean by that? I am asking for pictures, cant be that hard to make for someone who's good at it?
Forthjort	Suicide bombers should be one upped by sending suicide bombers to them! | That way we sure would show them! Fight fire with fire!
Forthjort	you cant do this half assed, you need proper gear that makes you look genuine.  Paint soft guns realistically, wear hoodies and balaclava's, and most importantly, be agressive.  Alternatively, go to a local gang and ask them for help to storm said police station, they will happily help you out!
Forthjort	...into what?
Forthjort	what makes you think that?
Forthjort	The best online Flash game sites? | [removed]
My_Weird_Acca	Weird one. Kind of want to kill myself. But also don't. | I don't even know what is going through my head right now.    I want to be dead. But I don't.    I don't want to cause that pain to my wife. My family. My friends.    I don't want to be thought of anymore. By anyone. I just want to not exist.    One day. Maybe. 
FearSypher	Yeah I understand that. But I still think I can get her back. I mean the process of re attracting and I know it's a long shot and it's a small percentage but I feel like I have to try. 
FearSypher	Hey I'd love to talk, been going through a tough few months and survived 2 suicide attempts and a car crash  
FearSypher	I wanna die | I just can't deal with living without her. Please If anyone can reach out and talk please help me. 
FearSypher	Suicide over her ?? | I loved my ex gf so much. We dated for 3 years and I lost sight of everything in the last year. I became controlling possessive and isolating. I realize what I did wrong and have been trying to change for the better. But she won't give me the time of day. I am no contact mode with her to focus on myself but for fuck sakes it's so hard. She meant the world to me and I have tried to commit suicide twice over this. The first time I hallucinated the swat team was in my appartment and the second my parents rescued me as I laid half past dead on my couch. Both attempts were over dosing. I also survived a pretty bad car crash too so with in the last month and half i have survived two suicide attempts and a car crash and I still want to end it. I just love her so damn much and want to show her how much I changed and that I am the man that she fell in love with. I have also been cutting too and self harming. Can anyone help me ? I just want her back so badly!!!!  
weirdhugh	Oh you too, can you tell me more, i feel terrible cutting people off but i feel like they deserve it. 
weirdhugh	I've cut so many people from my life, i have no one left. | I dont know what the definition of friendship is but what i do know is that they are suppose to be there for you. I find myself being such a people pleasure just to break the ice on a conversation by asking what the other person probably want to be asked. I feed people's ego everyday with compliments, encouragement and i feel like this has given people permission to take me for granted.
weirdhugh	When people disappoint me in life, i retreat to /r/depression | 
weirdhugh	This is me every lunch period at school
weirdhugh	The saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless and they dont want anyone to feel like that. | R.I.P Robin Williams
weirdhugh	Man i wish i could hug you man, im in tears just from reading this. I dont know what i could say that could make you feel better but i just want you to know im here for you even though i dont know you. Take good care of yourself
weirdhugh	Why dont you look into making new friends, im going through the exact same thing and im jut tired of always having to listen to people going on and on about their lives. Im not psychiatrist. I have problems and feelings that would like to express too why is it so hard for you to listen, why must it be always about you 24/7.You seem like a wonderful person, i hope you can find people in your life that will be there for you.Thanks for sharing
weirdhugh	Your right but dont we all know that already ?
weirdhugh	It breaks my heart that i cant answer "how are you" honestly ? | [removed]
weirdhugh	Whats really going on, are you having an existential crisis ? If you dont mind me asking
weirdhugh	Did you ever consider taking a semester off if your depression is stopping you from getting any work done. The last thing you want to do is fail in some of your courses. All the best to you, sorry if that wasn't helpful i just thought i would reply because im also in the same situation. 
weirdhugh	Same here, she calls me sometimes to just tell me to get over it as if i can just switch it on and off. Back then people didnt acknowledge that depression was a real thing which explain why she may say that. What about your friends do they know
weirdhugh	I love it here because i dont have to pretend to be someone im not. I dont feel a heavy cloud that lingers above my head. Honestly, things are not good, life is a roller coaster for me. Sometimes i have good days and by good days, i mean i find a song that makes me happy but mostly my anxiety/depression controls a big part of my life. Thanks for listening :)
weirdhugh	Im sorry to hear about how depressing life must be for you.Would you say that your afraid that if you tell her about whats going on in your head and life in general that it might scare her off. Is she the kind of person you talk too regularly? I think if she is the kind of person that will listen to you and not just give you a "it will get better" answer then i think its ok to let her know, especially if she is your best friend. Hope all works well and thanks for sharing. :)
weirdhugh	Well said, exactly! 
weirdhugh	I wish people did, i think even though we live in such close proximity, we couldnt be further away. I was in this office with like 20 other people and the room was silent. Everyone was looking down on their phone. I do hope there are people in your life that do want to know how your weekend was. Thanks for sharing :)
weirdhugh	I do that too, do you feel sad though wishing you could tell people whether it be your friends or family whats really going on ? If you dont mind me asking
weirdhugh	Yea same here, they wouldn't understand because depression to them is weakness. Until that day comes, hang in there
weirdhugh	Friends will always put themselves first. I have found out the hard way
weirdhugh	Im happy for you, sometimes i cant leave my dorm to get food because of anxiety. Thanks for sharing
weirdhugh	I think you need to cut those people out of your life because if you cant have people who can be there for you, then what is the point of even being friends with them. Isnt that what friends are for ? I feel the same way too, i have two friends currently, one lives abroad and the other is my roommate in college. Only problem is that i find myself constantly listening to their problems, listening to how their day was but they never seem to care about whats going on in my life. Are these people really my friend or am i just their shrink. It pains me because i have no other "friends" so its either i learn to live with the fake friends i have now or not have any friends at all. Thanks for sharing. 
weirdhugh	I find it amazing that im not the only one. Im 23 years old too and much like yourself, i pushed people away after high school. Now im starting to push away my parents. I cant help it, i find flaws in people, i secretly want people that genuinely care about me as i care about them but i cant seem to find those people. Thanks for sharing  
weirdhugh	Look i know what your going through, im going through that now. Its a horrible feeling but i just want to let you know i care and understand. Im here if you need to talk, have a wonderful weekend
weirdhugh	Thanks you too :)
weirdhugh	Hey thank you so much, your wonderful words touched my heart. I wish i knew people much like yourself in life. I hope you continue to stay committed but if you do find people that treat you like the nice individual that you are, i hope a friendship or relationship can fester. Thank you so much and i hope you have a wonderful weekend. :D
weirdhugh	I feel the exact same way sometimes, i feel like im being clingy and that it will scare them off. Hey dont ever stop being the nice person that you are. Your taken for granted 
weirdhugh	Putting other people's needs infront of your own | I feel like i live for other people. Everyday i compliment people, tell them how important and valued they are and not even a simple thank you. How can you allow someone to always be making you feel good when you cant even do the same for him. I just dont think other people are as committed to friendship as i am, i always try to be the best of friend but it feels like im a servant that listens to problems and offers encouragement. 
weirdhugh	Its not that im trying to please people its just that im trying to be a better friend to them than they are to me. I dont let them boss me around but its sad sometimes when they never do or say the things that i do for them. I guess im scared of losing certain people as friends because i dont have that many people in my life that care about me to begin with.
weirdhugh	Thanks for the advice, it does not feel well especially when the time comes for them to be there for you. I hope you find the right people in your life that will care about you and not just string you along because you feed their ego with compliments and appraisals. Hang in there man
weirdhugh	Hey thanks, im sure you are even cooler person :D
weirdhugh	Dont get down on yourself, you seem like a wonderful person. You dont need people who make you feel like your their third pick. Keep being the nice and generous person that you are because i know someone will appreciate you for your kindheartedness. I also find myself always putting other peoples need infront of my own. Making them feel good seems like a priority. It pains me when they dont reciprocate or even want to know how im doing. Take care friend
weirdhugh	I had one yesterday night, it almost made me want to kill myself. Same here man, but i think the best way is to distract yourself and surround yourself with good positive people. 
weirdhugh	Dude the worst thing you can do to yourself is dwell on things you wish you would have done as a kid. I did that the other day almost made me want to kill myself. Live in the moment, fuck your past mistakes, failures and regrets.
weirdhugh	I love this subreddit because these are my people, they go through what im going through and we can relate so well. I hope your doing ok
weirdhugh	Totally agree, i have conversations with myself all the time.
weirdhugh	This game looks fun but i wish you guys had the shoe swinging a little lower. Would definitely love to try this. Awesome guys
weirdhugh	Dont go! especially if you are depressed. I always found high school reunions to be a compare and contrast between people's lives. Its a bunch of people braggadociously going on about how great their lives are. I would never go if i was to ever be invited, even if i was successful. Hope things go well for you man
weirdhugh	I know what you mean, same thing happened to me. It feels terrible to be abandoned by the only person you trusted and could count on to be there for you. Hope all is well with you
weirdhugh	I think you should try to be who you wish you could be. It sounds confusing but for example, im shy, recluse so what i would want to do is to be the complete opposite. It hasnt been easy but at times i escape my shell and live for a while. Its difficult i know but if you could do something like that. Are you ok though ?
weirdhugh	Your welcome, take care ok. 
weirdhugh	Your welcome man, take care.
weirdhugh	I totally agree, when im depressed i dont give a shit about anything or anyones opinion but when anxiety kicks in, suddenly i worry what everyone thinks about me. Fuck anxiety 
weirdhugh	I think you should tell him/her what you just said here. If your cancel you wont get the help that you need and it will only get worse. Im not an expert or anything but i if i could get help for my anxiety, depression i would take it. I have felt like im some attention seeker whore but its just your mind playing tricks on you. There is something wrong and i think you should look into getting some professional help. I hope your doing ok and hopefully look forward to hearing about how it went with the therapists or doctor. Take care
weirdhugh	 I live in a foreign country myself and the only friend i have just happens to be a foreigner too. Its been difficult to make friends. 3 years like yourself but i feel invisible too, who knows what would have happened if i had not met this foreigner. I always found that when living in a foreign country, you have to accustom to not only the language but the culture and the way people do things.  You should talk to your girlfriend about it maybe she could help. 
weirdhugh	There is some meaning to life, yes alot of it is bullshit but there is some purpose. Depression does that you, makes you look at all the negatives in life. 
weirdhugh	I push people to talk to girls i wish i had the courage to talk too. | I talked my roomate into talking to a girl i really like, it hurt seeing him talking to her but my anxiety has convinced me that i dont deserve anything good.
weirdhugh	Ok i see, well just know whatever stuff they tell you just know your just like any other person and that its ok to feel depressed. Life isnt all sunshine and rainbow. Im introvert and anti social too, its normal for some people to be this way but it wont always be like this. I know i sound like im telling you to get over it but im not, im just saying you dont need the medication. The pain your going through wont go away over night but i know that you wont always feel the way you feel like now. Things do get better, i hope you can trust me on that
weirdhugh	It wouldnt worsen your depression, it would make you feel better about yourself. He would obviously care about you and your well being so it wouldnt be a burden on him because he cares about you.I hope you feel better
weirdhugh	What happened ? Was there something that made her to want to say these things ? I hope your ok, dont feel too bad. Please dont kill yourself, if you want someone to talk to and not in a creepy way or anything, like unload your feelings im here as well other people. We are a community. Take care
weirdhugh	An appointment for what if you dont mind me asking ? Just dont listen to that little voice behind your head. I have been listening to it all my life and it has only made my life a living hell, i dont want to see that happen to you purplegrapes :)
weirdhugh	Im literally in the same boat. I just dont care about anything anymore. Why should i read some fucking history book about some bullshit that wont add anything to my life. I find all my classes to be a waste of time, im always counting down the minutes until i can retreat back to my dorm. 
weirdhugh	i tell myself that all the time but im too much of a mess for something like that to ever happen to me. I dont think a girl would ever put up with me, im sad all the time, my face shows it and even just my tone. 
weirdhugh	Its hard to masturbate when your depressed isnt it ? | 
weirdhugh	Your better off.
weirdhugh	I really like the way you paint a picture with your feelings. Im going through something much like yourself. Im a junior in college and i have been lonely and isolated since freshman year. I think im falling apart, i dont communicate with anyone that includes my family. They tell me to snap out of it but thats not gonna help. I feel your pain being in the closet and all. Im a film student and i have been writing a script for some time now, do you mind if i use the dream that you have been having in my script ?  Thanks for sharing, i enjoyed reading it
weirdhugh	i tell myself that all the time but im too much of a mess for something like that to ever happen to me. I dont think a girl would ever put up with me, im sad all the time, my face shows it and even just my tone. 
weirdhugh	wow that was beautiful, i hope you keep writing more post like this. I was looking for inspiring materials and i glad i found this.
weirdhugh	I feel like im a book in an abandoned library whose story is yet to be read. Im collecting dust everyday and i have been forgotten. | I walk around quiet with my headphones around campus but many people dont know how sad and alone i am. I put this tough exterior frown face, a shield but deep down im a nice person if you really got to know me. If i walked around happy all day with a smile, i feel like i would be even more of a fool, lying to myself. Books have been forgotten, maybe one day, cellphones will be forgotten as well, God knows people's interaction have been long forgotten. 
weirdhugh	Congratulations on the program man, really happy for you. I am also sorry for looking your parent to cancer man. Hope your ok, must be tough. Cant imagine, your tough. Hey dont worry man, you will make friends soon, college is where you meet the best people in life. But they are like a grey hair. Just hang tight. I hope things keep as they have like you pointed out. Hope your good, Take care
weirdhugh	Reasons why we wont be the great writers that we are destined to be, | 
weirdhugh	Hey man i've failed so many times in school but im a junior in college. You just have to keep doing your best man, its never too late to try. Life has a way of working things out, if you honestly work hard and do your best even if you fail. My friends ditched me dude, talk about my anxiety and depression bringing them down. I also have a friend who would only talk to me if i was asking how they are and whats up in their lives but other than that, they wouldnt message me. I have severe and by severe i mean hiding from teachers in bushes, taking routes, or entering bathrooms just to hide from people, If only you would see a video of my life, the hiding the fear. Anyways hold on things will work out for you
weirdhugh	Im glad i became depressed and you should too. | You get to see through all the bullshit that everyone else doesnt see. You arent fooling yourself like everyone else. Your smart enough not to be like everyone else trying to fit in.There are so many things that i have pieced together all because im depressed. Despite us ( depressors)not being happy, at least we get to see the true color of this world. How many people will die from obliviousness when everything was right in front of them. We depressed people see the world for what it really is. We are like Neo having now crossed into both world. Real Happiness does not exist in this fucked up world, i cant imagine being happy knowing someone else is dying but even by that fact alone, we blindly force ourselves to be happy in spite of all the fucked up things going on in the world. Do you know how selfish that is, its like who cares, fuck em. Thats why we spend loads of fucking cash on dumb shit ( black friday)and when it comes to giving, we give so fucking little. What sort of happiness is that, happiness should be omnipresent in everyones lives. I think even though im unhappy, i see all the bullshit things in life that normal people dont see
weirdhugh	If you have someone that you can talk to everyday, dont take them for granted. | I think people dont realize how difficult it is to make friends. You cant simply be yourself and expect to make friends. Everyday i sit in my dorm wishing i had someone to talk to, even if it was just about them. I dont want to talk to my mom cause then it would make even more depressed knowing that she is the only person i talk too. I feel so out of place
weirdhugh	I do overthink things but the anxiety and fear just wont go away. Feels like every time i try to talk to someone this load is thrown over my shoulders. 
weirdhugh	Do you push people away ? I feel the same way, this girl i went to school back in 8th grade reached out to me via facebook asking how i was but something told me to stop talking to her. She probably thinks im weird but i told myself that she didnt wanted to actually know how i was but more of just looking for a story to tell her friends about where i've been all these years.
weirdhugh	Im really happy for you, i know that i have to do those things. But i stutter, a lot of people dont know what that is, sometimes i pretend like im thinking about what to say because its the only way i wont make a fool of myself by twitching trying to get the words out. It makes me to look like some mentally challenge person. People push me away because of that. It makes me so sad because i have so much to say but i have to keep my mouth shut otherwise i'll look like stupid.
weirdhugh	Dude we are literally the same person. I've been to nine schools and all the "friends"( i use the term friend loosely) were momentarily too. I been having an existential crisis myself and i also live in another country where people could use english but its spoken in a different way. It feels like whenever i talk, its like im the big elephant in the room. My english is formal when compared to  their slangish english and native language. I just dont bother talking to people anymore, i refrain from any conversation. I never stay somewhere long enough to make long lasting friendships. I feel your pain. I dont have answers to your question but wherever you feel would give you happiness i guess thats where you should strive to want to be.
weirdhugh	Im not actully, i stutter. I raised my hands in class today and i had to pretend like i wasnt sure bout what i wanted to say because i couldnt get the words out. I was literally like "ugh.........." for 3 minutes everyone's eyes fixated on me. They must of thought i was an idiot. I had a really good question to ask too btw. I just need a friend more than anything in my life right now
weirdhugh	I enjoy reading you peace, you sound like a good human being, i think having gone through what you did has made you a wiser and better person than most people. 
weirdhugh	Unless you make friends freshman year, your forever alone. Im a serious introvert but luckily was able to make friends now they have all transferred to other schools. Now all i do is go to class and come back to my dorm. I have no friends at school. Alone I can't find the crowd to fit in to, a place I belong
weirdhugh	I used to enjoy going to church too but now i just cant get into the service. People make me anxious, i feel like they're looking at me even though i know they arent i always have this feeling that they are. I think you can still pursue those dreams.  I know that i am a mess but i refuse to let that get in the way of me achieving my dreams. I want something good to come out of the mess and i hope the same for you.
weirdhugh	Religious reasons how exactly, if you dont mind me asking ? I feel stuck too, i have really bad anxiety. 
weirdhugh	same here, totally. Everyone must think im weird but i desperately want someone to converse with. I feel so out of place. It makes me sad everyday. I hope your doing ok
weirdhugh	People arent just gonna approach you and talk to you. They probably think you arent friendly or someone to be bothered with. I think you should be open with them i guess. Im in the same boat as you. Im in college i live alone, no friends, my typical weekends involve me in my dorm surfing the web, playing video games going out only for food or to the bathroom. It sucks but unless i actually do anything about it, it will remain this way.
weirdhugh	i feel you, just dont get down on yourself is what i would advice. Just keep being friendly with people, dont come off as needy and eventually you will make friends.
weirdhugh	Im having an existential crisis, i just dont have the same feelings as i did before. I dont know if you pray but i just cant find the words you know ? I feel like i dont have the energy, i dont think anything can help me. Do you feel this way
weirdhugh	hello, hope your day is going great. If not would love to listen to how life is going with you
weirdhugh	I listen to Harold Budd, his music is wonderful and allows me to escape. 
weirdhugh	Nothing but i happen to think killing yourself doesn't solve anything. I mean if you have people who care about you just imagine how devastated they will be, cleaning after your mess and shit. If you must, dont leave a mess. Get away or something, some place no one will find you.
weirdhugh	please dont kill yourself
weirdhugh	Your a poet my friend 
weirdhugh	I think you need human connection, what you need is not someone over some computer to help you. Even though that may be helpful i always found that talking to people face to face tends to give me life when im depressed. Sadly, its been ages since that has happened. If you know someone that would listen then reach out to them. If not, we're here nevertheless. 
weirdhugh	I think some people have it for long periods of time and others dont have it for that long in their lives. I rarely sing so im not sure, if i sing alone i wont stutter but havent with other people.
weirdhugh	Thank you, everyone in my family stuttered except my mom but mine lasted longer in all my family. Everyone else had it up until they were 10 and it just vanished but i seem to have continued to have it. There isnt any professional help at my school, i guess i just have to not talk to people and hopefully it will come to pass.
weirdhugh	The cafeteria can be a scary place. I feel that way every time im eating food, its like i have a loaded gun to my head. Its a long story im not gonna get into it but it sucks for sure.
weirdhugh	Not all cases are the same, it comes in various forms. When i was in 2th grade i used to twitch and then 5th i would twitch and so and so on. No matter how much i try to get the words out slowly it just comes out in bits and pieces.I just dont want to scare people off so i often keep quiet and walk away so as not to make a scene. Its the life i have been given. 
weirdhugh	Being a stutterer and depressed | I literally cant talk to anyone without twitching and stuttering, it makes me to standout as someone with a mental illness. In class i cant raise my hand because im afraid i'll stutter and get laughed at. I have sever anxiety, going to the cafeteria literally feels like im walking in a mine field with guns pointed at me. The feeling is indescribable, you literally cant talk, no one wants to sympathize and talk to you the very least. I dont know how much more of this i can take.Thanks for taking the time to read this
weirdhugh	I literally only go for breakfast cause its the only time when they arent a lot of people. btw college student
weirdhugh	Im a university student  and our school's psychiatrist is borderline psychotic. All her answers are suck it up, get on with your life.Pretty much snap out it responses. What answers can i get from someone like that ? I think i just have to be brave and live with this illness. 
weirdhugh	Unless you've been in more than 100 movies no one is ever gonna find your video. You make it seem like you committed murder. A lot of people have done stupid things when their emotions were high. My advice is to pick yourself up and get on with your life. It would be alot worst if you were a woman so its not even that big of a deal. 
weirdhugh	Man i smoked yesterday but it didnt make me feel better than i did before i smoked. My advice is fight the temptations, distract yourself, find something to substitute weed. I know its hard man, but its bottomless pit it will never solve your problems especially since you have so much. Start living man ,its not too late
weirdhugh	Your not any of those things that you listed. I hold unto things which have been said to me too. Like for weeks and even years. I hate looking in the mirror, i am so self conscious about myself i cant take group shots. Dont internalize nothing, you may think you are all of those things you mentioned but to me who knows exactly how it feels to go through what you said, your alright with me. I wouldn't label you any of those things because just reading this it didnt make you sound like any of those names. You sounded like someone who cares about things and people. You have feelings too and you hate it when they get hurt.
weirdhugh	This was beautifully written and expressed. I tell myself everyday that if only i wasnt living where i live now, go to school where i go to school, i would be happy. The ocean is my one and only destination if asked to live there for the rest of my life. I am unhappy as you can tell but i keep faith and love a live when i think of all the places i could be and reasons i wouldnt be depressed anymore. 
weirdhugh	I think everything will stay the same, if your wondering if you'll want more or have less sex and then make sex to be this big elephant in the room then dont worry about it. Whats more important is that the love and i guess commitment you took in remaining abstinent until your marriage night is, i think what indicates a good marriage. Its built on love and not sex and i think thats all you need to know. No more nor less
weirdhugh	hahahaha man this should be on The tonight show with Jimmy Fallon.
weirdhugh	Depression is putting my life long dreams on hold | Ever want to do something that you know will be beneficial to you achieving your dreams but you feel restless and unmotivated yet know that you will look back and regret these wasted hours. I know i can change my life completely but i just feel lazy to do anything about it.
weirdhugh	Im not a psychiatrist or anything but i just wanted to let you know that your post did not go unread cause i know how it feels to reach out to people and not get heard. Im currently going through the same thing ( existential anxiety). I hope this horrible period in your life will come to pass and that you will be able experience joy again in your life. Its a terrible feeling but i want you to know i understand. Take care
weirdhugh	I have to go back to college tomorrow but it feels like the opening scene in saving private Ryan. Im so nervous and its not even my first year, im a junior.  p.s No friends whatsoever 
weirdhugh	Is it so much to ask to have friend or someone to not only be there for me but i to be there for them ? | Thinking back over many years of living with depression, I can quickly find many reasons why I had such trouble finding a friend to talk to when I most needed one. I dont want to bore people with my depression but i feel that maybe if i had a friend or someone to talk too, it would take my mind off of my depression and give me some happiness. Having depression sucks but whats even worst is having no one in your life to at least talk to about life in general.
weirdhugh	Just because they dont understand you shouldn't stop you from helping around the house. What i meant was go about your business. Dont bother engaging in conversations with them if you know they dont care about your mental health. Im guessing your young so probably the reason you get in trouble. I guess not all parents are alike

Pacific88	is there a skin code in the cd folder?

Pacific88	Dw that much about your gpu since league is an a CPU intensive game 
Pacific88	Just saw them on an episode of sneaker shopping with complex and thought they looked pretty dope.
Pacific88	Oh, thank you :)
Pacific88	[Tasty](https://imgur.com/FXK8ge2)  How can something like this even happen?
Pacific88	Wasn't there a similar guide on the front page awhile ago but for Camille?
Pacific88	I thought it was some sort of dev mode too but I doubt they even keep that config on live servers, too risky

Pacific88	was just about to ask why stop at ep25, I think I will watch the whole thing
Pacific88	Okay thank you very much!
Pacific88	So I start with just the death note, and if I may ask, what's the difference between the original death note and re-light version?
Pacific88	"stop at 1x25" could you explain that? and which anime do I watch first? (I've included an image of the different anime's and movies)
Pacific88	Nice

Pacific88	No harm done, I was mostly just venting in this post anyways 
Pacific88	but she is still T H I C C tho
Pacific88	I know how to check my ping, but the average league player isn't going to go to the extent of going to a website just to check their ping before queuing up for a ranked game. It would be better to implement it in to the client and make it easily viewable so that they might rethink entering a ranked game with 300ms
Pacific88	There was a post on the main league subreddit that analyzed the power spikes of rushing wits end, bork, T2 boots or rage blade. And at full stacks the rage blade is the best rush I think second was wits end (don't quote me on that). If you want I could try and find the post.
Pacific88	No just gives you a little piece of cake next to your name :)
Pacific88	Happy cake day!
Pacific88	Love the laugh at the Ziggs part 
Pacific88	tl:dr?
Pacific88	Same here, no icon for me :(
Pacific88	ah ty
Pacific88	TSM Season 3 icon that i got from a mistake riot made. Brings me luck
Pacific88	Ayy 
Pacific88	Can't wait for voice chat, reasons like this where you don't rly have time to type it in chat, voice chat would make ranked so much easier.

Pacific88	What's his twitch?
Pacific88	73
Pacific88	Is it only in the EU regions?
Pacific88	Like I said, I get bored fast and once I get bored I kinda can't go back and perform at the same level with that champ. I "abused" graves while he was still good, twitch is situational and I don't enjoy playing Jax. That's my dilemma.
Pacific88	That's true, hard to admit but true
Pacific88	Online games or a good single player campaign is the only thing I have in my life. I never get invited to anything, I want to socialize and meet new people but my social anxiety makes that impossible.
Pacific88	Jungler here too
Pacific88	I don't choose to spend all my days in front of my pc playing games or browsing Reddit, but that's all I got. Don't have any friends to socialize with, every time I try and plan something they all bail out so I'm kinda forced to be in my room all day. Being all lonely and shit 🙂   I mean... me too, thanks!
Pacific88	Hey man I know the pain, didn't gamble on his site but used others that weren't legit lost alot of money (thousands). But like I said I still want to hear an explanation or maybe some more information from him on what's been going on etc.
Pacific88	It's WAS good entertainment back when he was playing league. Don't know if you was watching back then but if you were then you would probably understand. He himself will have to live with what he has done, there is no forgetting or condoning that. Yes he may be a "piece of shit" but I used to like watching his streams. Helped me get trough some hard times.
Pacific88	Made my day a little better, thank you.
Pacific88	If it wasn't for video games I probably wouldn't be writing this comment. Try picking up a game to play. 
Pacific88	Oh, if that's the case then I'll probably won't watch but I'll definitely catch the first stream or w/e he is going to put out that might give us some more insight in to what's been going on.
Pacific88	That describes how I'm feeling quite well.
Pacific88	Damn, I don't really have a social life since no one ever invites me to anything and my confidence is nonexistent so maybe try watching a series? Or are you looking for social interaction?
Pacific88	That's something I want to do also but don't rly have friends. Sorry I'm out of tips then :(
Pacific88	Confidence, what's that?
Pacific88	Thank you!
Pacific88	yes I'm talking about spinners
Pacific88	Its a Kong from Fidgethq
Pacific88	He does the exact same thing except he somehow manages to get his toys stuck under our furniture then stands there and LITERALLY screams until someone comes and gets them for him. Still love him. 
Pacific88	I know, right!
Pacific88	Glad I was prepared to catch it, and thank you :)
Pacific88	Ah, feel dumb now XD
Pacific88	Wasn't trying to show anything off, I spend most of my time in front of my pc so I just propped it up against the keyboard. Didn't rly think that much about it :)
Pacific88	Would it be feasible lets say that I was shipped to someone in a neighboring country and have them send it to you?
Pacific88	Well I live in Sweden so the shipping time might not be that long for you.
Pacific88	Did not have to pay anything extra 
Pacific88	Could you rephrase that? (Not a native English speaker)
Pacific88	Don’t think you can customize them, people have bought different ones and swapped the caps on them.
Pacific88	Feel the same here :)
Pacific88	What sane person would ever transfer from EUW to Turkey!!???

Pacific88	Why'd he break up with his gf? I thought their relationship was going fine?
Pacific88	Nice, can't wait to get mine. Been waiting almost a month now for it to arrive.
Pacific88	Same problem here, every patch the performance has been getting worse for me
Pacific88	Same to you man!

Pacific88	Hope someone would try 💯💯
Pacific88	Try some weed instead of the antidepressants, heard it helps idk tho 🔥🔥😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻💯💯
Pacific88	Thanks, it's in the middle of the day rn so I'm feeling a bit better, but it gets worse during the nights. Glad I've got Reddit.

Pacific88	Don't use pure acetone, either go with isopropyl or acetone that has oil in it 
Pacific88	Did you use acetone that has oil in it? I used acetone that had oil in it to clean a cheap spinner I had, my spin time on that one increased.
Pacific88	What's so special about it?
Pacific88	What's the price?

Pacific88	Alright man 🙂
Pacific88	I'm currently in high school so having this to fidget with and not disturb other people is great.  just a long wait but I'm hoping it is worth it.
sweetlittlespitfire	I don't want to but I'm living at home and my mother values a regulAr wage over happiness or contentment. She would rather have me working for free on a 37+ jr exploitative contract than dealing with my health.   I either have to make her happy or do what I think is right. A quiet Life Means do what she says. But it's not what my body dictates 
sweetlittlespitfire	I tried that earlier with the Samaritans . Sounded like an elderly lady who simply said "the line is very bad" before hanging up.  Not hugely helpful in my state of mind. 
sweetlittlespitfire	I'm scared | I've made my plan and it starts in less than 24hrs after I've dropped my sister off to uni. After then, my worth ends and my need to be here is over.   I want to do it but at the same time I don't. I've resigned myself to doing it but I'm terrified of it.    I'm trapped and I need to get out and I don't know how.

liveundereignof1king	Really scared about this job interview? | I had this job for like 2 weeks from November until December last year. I ended up quitting without a two week notice and not really on good terms. I tried a few times to get my job back but with no luck. Last tuesday I was talking to a recruiter and I asked if she had any cleaning jobs available. She said she had a ton and then I asked her if she worked with (the company I used to work for) and she said yes. I told her that I previously worked there and i would like to go back. She called the cleaning place and she emailed me back and said that I was not eligible for rehire there. However, on Friday I got a call from the cleaning place I used to work for and they asked me if I wanted to come in for an interview which is tomorrow. When the guy from the cleaning place called me he didn't seem to know that I used to work there and I was too scared to say anything to him. I know for a fact he is going to find out. I really need this job and I am very scared to go to this interview. I guess i'm scared because i'm afraid he will tell me right off the bat that he can't hire me and send me on my way. Or I will have an interview and then not get the job. I really really need this job and if i don't, then i don't know what I'm going to do.  What should i do?

In March, I really wanted to go back and I wrote an email explaining why I left and why I really wanted to come back. I told the person who reads the emails on the address I sent it to to forward the email to the HR department. Well a couple days later nobody replied to me and I remember getting angry and typing a rude response (yeah I know I shouldn't have did that). I also had typed out a cover letter and resume along with the application which pretty much went over the stuff I put in the email and why I would be a good fit for the position. Again, nobody ever replied to me. Nothing.   It just seems like no matter what, nobody will ever listen to my side of the story and will just make assumptions.   I'm sick of not being heard. What should I do? Seriously, I try to be calm and nice but I honestly feel like being a bitch is pretty much what you have to be these days.   What should I do?

Then all of a sudden he became withdrawn and secretive. He is no longer happy. He doesn't speak to anyone. All he does is sleep. Even when it's really hot he will wear long sleeve shirts. She has to do everything for him; it's like he has become a vegetable. He has become blue and bloated. He doesn't seem to do anything by himself except get to the bathroom. When he's in the bathroom he's in there for like 30 mins at a time. What do you think is wrong with him? 
liveundereignof1king	How do you let a guy let you be in control during intercourse? | 
liveundereignof1king	how do you deal with a guy who only wants to pleasure himself in bed? | This guy and I have been together for a month. When we have sex it seems like he only wants to please himself. I do give him head but he will rush through oral when he gives it to me. When we have the actual intercourse, he always wants to be in control. Every time I ask him if I can be in control he says, "I can pleasure you better if I'm in control."   What do you think I should do?  
liveundereignof1king	Is it safe to have sex without birth control if your partner wears a condom? | 
liveundereignof1king	how do you deal with a guy who sometimes wants to have sex up to ten times a day? | he always wants anal, which I find too painful to endure. What should I do? 
liveundereignof1king	Is she just being used for sex? | theres this chick that has a "boyfriend." He always sneaks her into his apartment and always asks her if someone knows if she's with him and if anyone saw her coming in. He tells her that he wants to keep the relationship secret. Every time she comes over, the first thing he does is make out with her and tries to get her in bed. Is she being used?

Claire2209	Explains why I'm reaching out to anyone I know, desperate to feel loved 
Claire2209	I'm sorry you're going through this, I know how you feel, like your heart is being ripped out 
Claire2209	I ruined the best relationship of my life and I don't know how to keep going | I was an asshole, I pushed him too hard and he left me. No amount of apologising is changing his mind. I'm lost, I'm afraid to go to sleep because as soon as I get into bed I just cry because I miss him so much. I'm full of so much regret and I can't see how I'm going to make it through the next fews days. I thought maybe he just needed to cool off, but he's certain he's done with me. And now I'm done with me. I destroyed the only good thing in my life and I can't live with myself anymore
Claire2209	Yeah long distance is difficult. I was very depressed while I was with my ex, and once I left and met my current boyfriend (who's also longish distance) I felt much better. And like you said I'm currently at the point where when I'm not talking to him or texting him I feel really really down. I'm trying to work on figuring out what it is during those times that gets me down because you're right it's not fair to rest all your happiness on one person. Maybe if you figure out what else is missing from your life it might help? 
Claire2209	Are you dating the guy? 
Claire2209	No problem, honestly I got to the same point you are, no love left, just staying out of habit and that's when I knew it was time
Claire2209	Op 4 months ago I was in a similar situation; toxic relationship with my boyfriend of 8 years, lived together for 5, pretty much my only friend. I broke up with him and moved back in with my mother. It was difficult at first, but honestly after a few days I felt like a weight had been lifted and after a few weeks I was happier than I've ever been and I still am. The first step is the hardest, but you can definitely do it
Claire2209	Just do what you normally do, I always sit in the back, treat him like a stranger because he is 
Claire2209	I'm so sorry you're in this situation. Do you have any family you can go to? Because I think it's time you cut this guy out of your life he's no good for your health, or your childs
Claire2209	Why are you with this guy? I know you think that age is not on your side but seriously. Would you rather stay with him another 8 years, miserable and eventually divorce or call it off now, heal and start to find someone that will actually care for you. Age aside, this relationship is toxic and you need to get out. You deserve better 
Claire2209	If you think "toughing it out" and forcing yourself to work will help your anxiety will work, then go for it. If not, then keep trying to find a therapist to work through the issues you have causing the anxiety in the first place. If you could even manage a single shift a week, or even like half a shift it might be a good idea to keep yourself in it because i know in myself if I avoid something giving me anxiety I'll never go back to it. Most importantly, don't beat yourself up over it! Yes some of your other friends with anxiety are managing but that doesn't mean you're expected to, everybody is completely different and so long as you're taking to steps to get it under control there's nothing you should feel guilty about 
Claire2209	Yeah that's a little weird regardless of what she works as 
Claire2209	It might awaken her to how serious it is. Sexual compatability is really really important, she really needs to make some compromises with you 
Claire2209	If games make you feel good maybe you shouldn't stop it, but you could try and incorporate some study to help your grades. Take it slow, maybe like 30 mins studying for an hour of games

Claire2209	23/F Discord group needs active members! | Hi everyone, I'm admin of a small discord group thats mostly used by lonely people looking for some socialisation and Internet friends. We're having trouble finding people who will actually engage in chatting and conversation instead of lurking. So if you think you could fill the void and provide some witty banter or even just nonsense chit chat, hit us up! I'm Casiaa, hope to hear from you! https://discord.gg/TTqZPy
Claire2209	https://discord.gg/atFxd
Claire2209	Discord server looking for members | Hi there! I'm admin of a small discord server thats looking for new members. We have a lot of members from here and also a few from r/depression. We would love to see a few new friendly faces as our chat has quietened down and some of the members that rely on the daily interaction are suffering a bit because of it. We have several different rooms to chat in, the main room can sometimes get very lively, however we do have specific rooms where you can go to get support or advice for any problems you may have.   NSFW disclaimer: this room can often discuss nsfw topics, so if you are under 18 or sensitive to such chat please bare this in mind.  We look forward to hearing from you!  https://discord.gg/Dz8CM link active for the next 12 hours.
Claire2209	No one here can give you medical advice, what I will say is discuss this with your doctor, and if you do happen to have any side effects tell them immediately as there are dozens of anti depressants out there, and it might be a case of finding what works best for you 
Claire2209	Is anyone at school aware of your depression? 
Claire2209	If your doctor is aware of your depression I'm sure he'll be more than happy to write a sick line for you 
Claire2209	Why not? If they know what's going on they can help you 
Claire2209	Hey there, join us on this discord server https://discord.gg/3sY7z  Our mod is from Ireland, I'm from the north and we have a good few others from around the world. It's not busy and it's mostly text chat but it's growing if you're interested. Come for a chat, just say Hi. We're listing to music right now 
Claire2209	If it doesn't do anything your doctor can always increase the dose. Give it a couple of weeks and report back to him 
Claire2209	Why *do* you want it? 
Claire2209	I wish I knew if anyone I know felt like that. I'm so oblivious to people's feelings and moods, I just don't get it, I don't pick up on emotions like that. It'd kill me if someone I loved went in silence without giving me a chance to help
Claire2209	This looks just like the Landgrab mansion from the sims bustin out! Was that your inspiration? 
Claire2209	Lol so did your build! I'm so breaking out my old PS2 tonight 
Claire2209	Ever thought of getting botox in your armpits? It stops the sweating and might allow your anxiety to calm down 
Claire2209	Unless you've been told it's like an "on the job" interview, where you would be showing them your skills, I would go classic shirt and tie. 
Claire2209	That damned pufferfish
Claire2209	Have you ever asked these people *why* they initially found you unapproachable? 
Claire2209	r/dentistry
Claire2209	Fuck sake dio get back to work 
Claire2209	Probably just worried about hygiene, at the end of the day it is a poop hole 
Claire2209	Need some advice please | I have not been diagnosed with tinnitus, however I do occasionally get ringing in my ears, probably due to the 7 years I spent with earphones shoved in them while I was at school. Anyway today ringing has started in my left ear seemingly out of the blue (check my last post for details) and hasn't stopped and I'm wondering would it be a good or bad idea to put an ear plug in that ear to protect it from more noise as that is making it worse.
Claire2209	Thank you, I haven't really used earphones in 5 years now but I think the damage was done
Claire2209	Sudden ringing and numbness in left ear | 23 year old female, no previous medical issues and currently taking no medication.   So as title says I have sudden onset ringing in my ears. I was watching a video on my phone, no earphones and volume was low so no sudden loud noise when it started. I also haven't stuck anything in my ear however I do wear disposable ear plugs every night (new clean pair each time).  I have had ringing before but usually only lasts like 30 minutes and is after using earphones at a loud volume, however this is going on 3 hours. My TMJ area feels very numb and maybe a little bit warmer than the other side of my face. The outer ear also feels kind of numb. Hearing isn't completely lost but any noise increases the volume of the ringing in my ear.   Can't see a nurse or doctor until tomorrow, until then any thoughts on how to reduce the ringing so I don't kill someone?
Claire2209	Definitely this. I've also heard using tea tree shampoo after you've properly treated the lice can help prevent getting them again
Claire2209	I fucking love reddit
Claire2209	Unless you're longing to be with whoever it is in the porn videos, it's not cheating. Cutting down and not gripping so hard will probably help with your ejaculation problems. As for her telling people? Perhaps ask her not to talk about stuff like that to people, although she might be pissed if she knows you saw her messages. Considering cross posting this to r/relationships 
Claire2209	So he's not your type and you don't want to ruin the friendship? Isn't this an obvious answer? Stay silent, keep your friend and consider buying a vibrater if you don't already have one. You could also try tinder for a hook up if you're that way inclined 
Claire2209	Out of curiosity, why wouldn't it work long term? 
Claire2209	Try different brands of sugar free, I find coke zero tastes far better than diet coke. A trip to your dentist might help put you off drinking it, the sugar will be causing decay and the fizz will be eroding your enamel. I've almost completely stopping drinking soda due to the effects it was having on my teeth 
Claire2209	But.. it's not fixed and predictable for men
Claire2209	If it's sugary soda then start small, switch to sugar free soda
Claire2209	Still no double XP here at 10:25GMT
Claire2209	You owe it to him to cut it off, if there's no future you can't keep stringing him along. It'll suck but he's young, he'll get over it. Maybe just don't insult him by saying he doesn't intellectually challenge you
Claire2209	Tyra is my main and I played her pretty much exclusively when I started, I sunk most of those hours into her 
Claire2209	Level 32 with level 15 Tyra and 83 hours play time
Claire2209	"something fierce" are you Northern Irish? 
Claire2209	I have the exact same problem. Big moon pie face, long curly hair. I've cut my hair short and it looked awful, so I'll always keep it long. I change it up by getting fringes (bangs) cut in, getting layers cut in and I'm planning on getting the ends lightened for that dark to blonde ombre look. Plenty you can do to change up your style :) 
Claire2209	There is none, but the maps are pretty small and you'll get to know them in time. Also switch around your team during your respawns to get an idea where they are 
Claire2209	MMM
Claire2209	Looks like an erotic book mark
Claire2209	If she thinks you're drunk how can she know you're seriously asking her out? If anything it's more likely she'll say no if she thinks you're drunk
Claire2209	Lie down to get the blood to your head, and tell a teacher that you need help if your mum isn't taking you seriously 
Claire2209	I'm sorry you feel this way, I often feel like I don't know who I am and what you've described sounds similar. Pm me if you ever want to talk to a stranger 
Claire2209	It might not be effecting your grades, but it's going to be affecting your physically. You're 16, you're not fully cooked yet, there's a reason why there's laws to wait till 18/21 before people can drink or do recreational drugs (where its legal). Your parents have every right to be pissed off and unfortunately as you're still a minor you're going to have to suck it up. If you're a smart kid you'll know what the effects of doing *any* drug under the age of 21 will be 
Claire2209	Oh thank you I didn't know this existed!
Claire2209	I'm not sure about the US (assuming that's where you are) but getting work done at a dental school is usually heavily discounted. 
Claire2209	What's going on in the rest of your life? Something has to be triggering this 
Claire2209	Do guru's read these? I'm still encountering supposedly fixed bugs | So after updating yesterday my sim finally stopped being weird and sat when she watched tv. However today (so after saving a quitting) she has started standing again. She also will not sit to read books. I repaired game etc and still no sitting.  Also I've just had to quit as she's stuck in the 'T' position at the top of the stairs again.  Edit: After some playing around, she will sit for a stand tv, but not a wall-mounted tv  Will add more as I come across them
Claire2209	Agreed 
Claire2209	She's great when played tactfully, but one on one against a full health enemy she wouldn't survive. I find she can take out low health easily and as she's usually around the action healing her team, I can see how it'd be easy for her to pick up 40+ eliminations 
Claire2209	Have you tried motion sickness medicines? Also would be good to talk to your doctor about this
Claire2209	You really need to consider leaving her then. That doesn't make you a bad person, you've done as much as you can, but at the end of the day it's entirely up to her to get the help she needs
Claire2209	You could try and get her to go to therapy with you, short of that I think you have to seriously consider its time to end it. It's not fair that you're miserable and shes not doing anything at all to help herself 
Claire2209	Is there anything that makes her happy? Or is she depressed all the time non stop? You may find that actually leaving her will give her the motivation to help herself 
Claire2209	The suicide thing is scary, any family you could contact, do you live close to her family? Do you know what her depression stems from? (sorry for all the questions!) 
Claire2209	I never text a guy I like first because I'm afraid I'm annoying him, but like you said I reply pretty promptly. Try not to read into it too much, and just straight up ask her when you hang out 
Claire2209	Well I think you should take a break from the relationship. The distance might kick start her desire to get better. If you're worried about suicide, you need to tell her family and tell her that you're going to let her family know, again it might knock some sense into her. Depression is really hard, I'm sure she knows full well exactly where she needs to start, but depression stops you starting, its a horrible cycle.
Claire2209	Try r/legaladvice 
Claire2209	It's going to take a while to recover, just keep the fluids coming, rest and maybe have some toast 
Claire2209	Most cats fur gets silky when they age from kitten to cat. Will also be softer if they are indoors only, groom often and have a good diet. One of my cats has a gorgeous silk coat, the other one has never lost his kitten fluff :) 
Claire2209	The requirement is 5, and given how I play my mastery 5 champions there's no f*cking way I'm starting comp. I play the champions I have over level 15 really well so I guess that's the bar I've set myself. Might have to go higher for the flanks 
Claire2209	I feel shit about this (it's not me fyi) , I'm not a new player but I suck at flank. I'm trying to get all my champions up to mastery 15 before I even think of joining competitive but I keep having games like this with flanks. From someone that's trying and failing, maybe they were just really struggling. Hopefully this wasn't a competitive match 
Claire2209	You've just sold Mal'Damba to me, thanks! 
Claire2209	So you're no stranger. I lost my grandmother in July '15 to pancreatic Cancer, she was 79 and as healthy as anything her whole life. She was diagnosed 3 months prior so it was an extremely sudden and horrifically fast process. It was my first experience with death and being with someone as they pass. In her final hours myself, my sister, mother and aunt all sat around her and told stories that we remembered about her. We laughed a lot, and although we're unsure if she heard us, we hope she did because we really celebrated her life in those final moments and came to realise how much we loved her and treasured those memories we had. I don't know if that will help you, and although it was a hard day at the time, looking back I wouldn't change it. Just being there with her was enough  
Claire2209	75 is a great age to reach, how lucky she is to have her final days with her loved ones. Have you experienced death before? 
Claire2209	I just finished watching Code Geass, I thought it was brilliant and I'm gagging for more 
Claire2209	I guess it depends on how you value sex. Is it nothing to you, and would you have no regrets having your first time with a stranger? Or would you rather it be with a partner and be more intimate?
Claire2209	I bet your friends aren't getting laid. If anyone lies its teenagers
Claire2209	If you want to have sex you're going to need to find a girlfriend. There's no point in saying you're too young, even though i think you are. Use protection. Be smart about it 
Claire2209	I had someone threaten to afk if a support wasn't picked, and that was just in casual. Games full of salty babies throwing their toys out of their pram 
Claire2209	You can change the crosshair in settings, there's not a massive selection but the two you mentioned are in there 
Claire2209	It's just a dream, the fact you're already thinking he likes you and you're sexually uncertain is just fuel for this kind of dream. Don't read into it too much 
Claire2209	I wish I had gold to give for the pun-induced snort I just had
Claire2209	As in cups of tea? And for a living or in a home or work situation? 
Claire2209	Just say no, tell him not to bother persisting because you're not going to change your answer 
Claire2209	Yup! Thanks OP, this has reinforced my view that "front line" should stay on the front line. 
Claire2209	Sometimes I play really well, sometimes I play really shit, it happens. I've never seen this yet though, wonder is it kids? I always tell be people, like when a low level front line is wandering around the map I always say "please stand on the objective and use your shield to block enemies." they could be well versed players just not giving a fuck, or they could be new to the game and not know how to play their characters. 
Claire2209	Probably not, you attempted to contact them more than 24 hours before the appointment so I imagine you'll be fine 
Claire2209	*quickly zooms in to check that's not my dumb ass*
Claire2209	Sounds like you can't get a woman let alone satisfy one then
Claire2209	Depends on the situation, if I'm in the middle of it with another champion and she's flanking me like she's supposed to I'm often not going into it with a full clip. 
Claire2209	I play Tyra and I only choose deft hands if the enemy team is full of flankers, which does happen as I'm sure you know. Nothing worse than getting KO'd by maeve cause you can't reload fast enough 
Claire2209	Newish casual player looking for a few people, UK | Just looking for a couple of people to have a few casual games with. Can do discord or Skype whatever suits. I mainly play as Tyra, but also play ying, torvald and evie. Uk/Eu for timezones please. Won't be online again till this evening, send me a message. Steam: Cass picture is a cat.  Edit: In game tag is Casiaa if you don't want to add steam
Claire2209	Stress can cause high blood pressure so I certainly think that anxiety can cause enough stress to raise it. At least while I was suffering badly from anxiety my heart rate and blood pressure where high. It calmed down as the anxiety  calmed down 
itsalmostoverdammit	If I made people who cared for me hate me, why shouldn't I kill myself?? | I had several really good friends that I was close with. When I started to become depressed, they were really supportive and caring to me and prayed for me. But I had become a toxic mood-killer that unintentionally guilt-tripped and hurt those friends and they eventually left me. One made a [blog post](https://imgur.com/a/hPs2J) about how it was an accomplishment to get rid of me, and another one told me [this](https://imgur.com/a/sWujw). At this point, it just *makes sense* to me to commit suicide. Why should anyone who hurt and drove away caring and loving people keep on living? What value is there in that kind of life? I've went to college and made lots of cool friends, but it doesn't change the fact that I hurt my past friends and made them leave me, so it just makes sense to die.

itsalmostoverdammit	No. They put in real effort to help me. I wouldn't be saying that if they just told me that, because obviously they could be lying, but I've seen evidence that they did care.

itsalmostoverdammit	they aren't pieces of shit at all, they're awesome people who were very caring and patient with me. it was me who made them leave me.
itsalmostoverdammit	those people didn't make me feel bad, they were really caring and patient with me. it was me that wore off their patience and made them leave me. they were good people.
itsalmostoverdammit	i see
itsalmostoverdammit	Nah, i have three friends that didn't leave me and still support me even though im in college and they're still in high school and havent seen my in like a year. some human beings are selfish fucks, not all. #notallhumans lol
itsalmostoverdammit	they would not be happy to see me kill myself in front of them, they aint gonna grin, and they gon get dat trauma too.  lol its funny how depressed i was yesterday that i made this post. today im in a pretty good mood and got two girls' numbers (im in college). life is weird. my brain is weird. thanks for taking the time to read and respond to me though. how come you're always on this sub?  
itsalmostoverdammit	"My dream is to kill myself in front of you" | I just told this to one of many friends that left me because my depression made me a toxic friend. Enjoy.  "My dream is to one day kill myself in front of you and everyone else who left me. I wanted to tell you that. Not that it matters to you. But i just really wanted to say it.  i just go to whatever event happens where everyone who left me are all in one place, i look you guys in the eye and shoot myself in the head with a good gun. maybe even angle it so my blood splatters on you guys. i know you don't care or think i'm just acting but that's literally the point. and it'll be my perfect happy ending and i will never again have to live a life where no one i miss misses me back, where people write blog posts about how getting rid of me is an accomplishment, how people celebrate getting rid of me and putting "no" on my face on instagram photos and laughing about it in the comments. i'll never have to live that life again and ill be free and happy. i know you're just rolling your eyes reading this but i wanted to finally tell someone and now i have. see you soon."
itsalmostoverdammit	Weird that you got downvoted for being honest. Anyways, I don't think they would get traumatized, they didn't care when I first started having depression problems and told them about it. if they did get traumatized, then i'd like that because they left and hurt me. that's really it. i know that makes me a bad person but, it's what would make me happy.
itsalmostoverdammit	How come?

itsalmostoverdammit	uh oh. time to delete my account. 
itsalmostoverdammit	Glad there are people I can relate to :) Thank you for the advice, and it's great things are working out for you. Also I like your username lol.
itsalmostoverdammit	Really enjoyed reading this and learned a lot. Thank you for your time and advice :)
itsalmostoverdammit	Aye I'm in ME too lol. Altho I've applied to transfer to ECE. And lol sure, DM me.
itsalmostoverdammit	We just build a racecar. I find it hard to fit in there. I just do work. No one really talks to me but my supervisor who teaches me how to do things. I might join a more social org next semester, although I'm scared after how this year turned out.
itsalmostoverdammit	I worked in the garage. They are super friendly and inviting, but to another freshman that's worked there longer than me. They don't say much to me. Maybe it's because I'm not interested in or know much about cars so I can't carry a conversation about one like the other freshman can.
itsalmostoverdammit	Thank you for all this great advice, it'll be a big help :)
itsalmostoverdammit	It was sad to be there and I'm glad I'm leaving that org since I'm transferring to ECE.
itsalmostoverdammit	That makes total sense, thank you :)
itsalmostoverdammit	Aye I'm starting to think I'm a sociopath too.  Yes things can change, but if they did change for me after ten years...it would be too late because college and my early adult life would be over.
itsalmostoverdammit	I don't remember feeling strong emotions towards them in the past. As for friends, having them reassured me about my feelings, but they've mostly drifted away once I went to college. I'm going to post on my college subreddit about my difficulties to make friends after I make this reply.  I forgot about that saying. I think it's true.  I'm also obsessed about my social standing and feel ugly, uninteresting, and worthless. Actually, that describes my feelings exactly. 
itsalmostoverdammit	Interesting, thanks.
itsalmostoverdammit	I feel for you. It's really screwed up what has happened to you. I know that I am supposed to try to convince you not to end your life, but honestly if I was in your position I'd want to do the same thing. Just please think about your parents. They will be really hurt. I know that life has already been so unfair and shitty to you, but maybe you should keep on living so that you don't hurt your parents, or other family members. 
i-am-from-space	I'm...I don't know. | Do you know what drawing and quartering is? I feel like that is what is happening to my mind; but instead of it finally being torn apart it's just left lingering in an everlasting state of "almost there". There is just so much pressure. Fears, failures, questions, expectations, changes, trauma, anxiety. It's almost like I'm feeling so much that it's being registered as nothing at all. I just...I don't know. I don't even know what has caused this- this weight. But I know that my mind has been in varying stages of being drawn and quartered for the past year or so. It's just so much. Too much. I'm not built for this. I'm too young to be able to handle this. I can't do this.
i-am-from-space	Lucky for me, I'm already pretty good at those. But it's good to know now that getting older won't help me. I think on some level I thought it would.

LilTaco21	I wrote a rough draft of my note, pointers would be useful. | Today is last day, and this is the last thing I'll ever write. Not as though that will be a bad thing though, as it is not as if anything i will ever did or had the capability of doing will ever be of interest to anyone. I lived a life devoid of much meaningful social interaction, and of this there is only one person to blame, and that person is me. As I find myself incapable of growing any social skills or any self respect or confidence, I don't see my situation to be fixable. I don't see the future becoming any brighter, because it never has. I am one that everything I touch turns To ash in my hands. Anyone who chooses to love me i will inevitably drive away, and I do not stand out enough to which a promising career lay in my path. To anyone reading this who thought they were my friend reading this, don't lie to yourself, you do not care for any of this, your life will not be affected in the slighted by my sudden and deliberate passing, you won't miss my voice as you never sought it, you won't miss my touch because you never sought it, you won't miss my life, because you never sought it. To my parents, you deserved a better son than me, one who was smarter, more handsome, more outgoing, and more caring. I'm sorry i couldn't be this for you, and don't blame yourself for this, this is my own doing, my own decision. And it's the last decision that I'll ever make in this wretched life.

Additionally with Graham having 2 consecutive 100 yard games the defense will probably rotate or favor his side.

ArsePickle	Thanks man, genuinely. My best friend who I've known for ages thinks its time to do something about it. I want them to find out on my terms so they don't find out the hard way if everything gets too much. 
ArsePickle	How do I tell my parents I'm depressed? | First thing first, I have never been professionally diagnosed with depression or any other mental disorder. However over the last year/year and a half I've been feeling lower than I've ever felt before, to the point where I've considered  killing myself multiple times (Though I haven't actually tried yet). It feels like I'm getting worse over the last 2 months though and I don't feel right getting help in secret without telling them first. What's the best way to go about such a sensitive subject? Sorry if this post is too long or this isn't the right place to post it
ArsePickle	I've considered the suicide hotline but I just would not know what to say or where to even begin.
ArsePickle	Yeah I have a great relationship with them. I'm just a very anxious and nervous person so how do I tell them their youngest son is tired of living most of the time.
ArsePickle	I wish to die to save future me any trouble | Over the last few months I've made some of the worst decisions possible in my fucking shit life. I have accepted the fact I'll never be happy again and most likely will die alone. Tonight was a drink filled night that might push me over the edge because of me being fucking stupid. There isn't even structure to this post I'm just rambling now lol 
ArsePickle	Booze is one of the only reasons I'm here. Even if it's from randoms atleast you have some human contact. 
ArsePickle	20
ArsePickle	My life is spiraling out of control and I'm too self-destructive to fix it. | I used to think that only certain things like my shitty job was what was making me unhappy but now I've realized that it's actually me failing to take control of my own life with my own self-destructive behavior that is making me miserable more and more everyday. But i'm too lazy and a piece of shit to do anything about it. Does anyone else feel like they're destined to be miserable no matter what or is it just me?
ArsePickle	Yeah there was a lot of dickheads there tonight. One guy next to me wouldn't stop shouting at people and grinding up on random girls in the crowd. It sucks because it was a great concert and Mac put on a great show but some turds had to ruin it for other people.
ArsePickle	Yeah it was great, really sucks that your night had to end like that hopefully he comes back soon so you can see him again! Standing is fine it's just about finding a good place to stay, I never normally go to the front for the exact same reason.

EternalMelancholy	I'm so lonely, it physically hurts. | What should I do?  I just want the pain to stop.
EternalMelancholy	Without love, life is meaningless. | Everyone has different goals and values in life. For me, finding love is one of them.  Without it, there are no colours. The world is cold. Everything is gray.  I'm already dead. I'll just spend the rest of my existence waiting to be buried.
EternalMelancholy	The feeling when all you need in your life is just a true, caring hug and it's impossible to have one.
EternalMelancholy	Maybe because I've got no one to hug?
EternalMelancholy	Does wasting days and months and years in front of a PC count as a hobby?  When I think about it, I don't really have any hobbies.
EternalMelancholy	I'm interested in philosophy and talking about the meaning of life and the universe. I can basically talk about anything. As long as that person is able to hold an actual conversation. When I think about it, I can talk about anything, except contemporary pop culture and sports. And those are the things most people talk about.  I've also realized I'm a pretty boring person. No real interests, no real hobbies. But when I think about it, I realize that most other people don't have any real interests or hobbies either. I also find them boring.
EternalMelancholy	It can be, really depends.  But the thing is - If you're not in *physical* pain right now, life doesn't have to be painful.  What is hurting you?
EternalMelancholy	It's impossible to be lonely forever. Simply because life doesn't last forever.
EternalMelancholy	Yes they can. And it happens not so rarely. Just *vaguely* mention that you're suicidal and in a few minutes you're in a back seat of a cop car with handcuffs.
EternalMelancholy	If you disregard social things (you need friends for them) what prevents you from doing anything else? Only yourself.  If you want to do anything - do it. I know it feels and how hard it sometimes is to force yourself outside or even outside of your bed, however, if you manage to do it, it's almost always worth it.  Having a shower and getting some clean clothes is the first step. You will feel refreshed.
EternalMelancholy	I know, being short as a guy is not the best thing that could happen.  However is there anything you could do about it? I guess not.  What you *could* do is focus on improving your body by going to the gym and focus on improving your mind by gaining confidence. Not giving a fuck is attractive. Being tall and depressed/anxious/autistic isn't.  And to be honest, 5ft6 is not *that* short. Sure, you are shorter than most guys, but you're still taller than most girls. And most girls don't care about height that much, only that you're taller than them. Just don't go for the girls wearing heels.
EternalMelancholy	I'm so excruciatingly lonely. | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	What happens when you get older? | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	As funny as your advice may seem, it's absolutely correct!  The thing is - I'm not physically unattractive.  If you're physically unattractive you can go to gym, start eating healthy, get some nice clothes, etc. etc.  But what do you do if you're mentally unattractive? Because I'm mentally unattractive.
EternalMelancholy	I know what you mean.  Right now, I'm trying to learn how to embrace my loneliness.  If this world doesn't have room for you - create your own world.
EternalMelancholy	Girlfriend/Boyfriend | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	Sometimes feeling *something* is better than feeling nothing. But sometimes, you would give anything just for the pain to stop and to finally feel - *nothing*.  I know how you're feeling. It's tough. I know it may seem hard, but try to enjoy the void. At least you're not feeling any pain.
EternalMelancholy	Oh, I get it. It was a bit oddly phrased.
EternalMelancholy	But why does God allow those things to exist? Isn't that cruel?
EternalMelancholy	But where do the pain, suffering, evil and misery come from?
EternalMelancholy	The only thing that prevents this world from being like that is - people.
EternalMelancholy	Well, I'm not old (yet).  I'm just wondering what will happen when I do get older.
EternalMelancholy	A world where the Sun is brighter. A world in which the colors are prettier. A world without pain. A world without loneliness. A world without suffering.
EternalMelancholy	Imagination helps.
EternalMelancholy	I actually work out (at home) regularly and I'm in a (very) good physical shape.  I went to a few gyms a couple of years ago. Even though I met many people there, I haven't managed to establish any deeper connection with anyone of them.
EternalMelancholy	Ok, but what makes your life bullshit? That's what I'm trying so hard to find out.
EternalMelancholy	But do you have a reason to die for?
EternalMelancholy	You're right. Being stuck inside a room certainly won't let people know I exist. But that's exactly what I was thinking about. That's what depression is basically about. Withdrawal, isolation and lack of motivation.  And I'm not expecting anyone to save me. I know I have to do that myself.  I just want to have someone to make things a little bit more bearable.  Cuddling feels nice whether you're depressed or not.
EternalMelancholy	But why are you in a hurry? We're all going to stop existing sooner or later.  I think you're suffering and you want to end the suffering. And you want to end suffering by ending your existence.  Why are you suffering?
EternalMelancholy	Well, I'm not going to lie - that's always an option. But what makes you think it's the best one?
EternalMelancholy	I used to be a real gamer. There was a period of my life when I used to play WoW for 12+ hours per day. That was about 10 years ago.  I'm too old for that shit. Haven't played any video games for 6 or 7 years. 
EternalMelancholy	You obviously haven't read the post. *Life itself is temporary.*
EternalMelancholy	Knowing that cold war is over.  No more threat of nuclear apocalypse.  Feeling of freedom.  Feeling that everything is progressing.  Optimism.  More carefree and relaxed life.  Less political correctness.  No smartphones and social media.  The list could go on...  The sky was different, the Sun was different. Maybe it's just because I was younger...  Who knows what will happen in the next 10, 20 or 30 years?  But whatever happens, the objective fact is that the world is going down the shitter and that there is basically nothing that can prevent it.  Maybe a nuclear war would be nice? Or a (real) global pandemic?  Somehow, I feel sorry for the kids born today. At least we've had that tiny fraction of genuine hope and joy, something I don't think new generations will ever experience.
EternalMelancholy	Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems. | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	I feel the same.  The clock is ticking and the time is passing. Maybe that's not even bad, if you think about it.  As you get older, you get more numb and there is a comforting feeling that every second, you're closer to the time of your death.  If you look at life that way, you realize that nothing actually matters and that no matter how painful, *everything* will be over one day.
EternalMelancholy	Even if you are locked up on a life sentence in a maximum security prison, with absolutely no chance of ever getting out or committing suicide, there is always a way out. It's called natural death.  Time and death. Without them, life would be literal hell.  With them, everything can be at least...bearable.
EternalMelancholy	This might sound a bit harsh, but...tell them to fuck off. The sooner you do it the better.  Tell them where you see yourself and what your goals in life are. If they have other plans for you, well, they're just that - their plans.  If everyone blindly followed their parents' plans and ideas, almost everyone would be a world-class sports player with a PhD. /s  Of course, that is not possible, nor realistic.  Just relax and do whatever you want. You're still young.  Nothing you do or don't do now will matter in a couple of years.
EternalMelancholy	Wow, that really sucks.  Why do you think he called you a failure? I'm pretty sure he's not right.
EternalMelancholy	Hi. Why are you upset?
EternalMelancholy	I'll be honest with you - I crave for sex and intimacy. | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	Depression and Loneliness | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	I don't know how to help you, just wanted to say that I know how you're feeling, because I'm feeling *exactly* the same.
EternalMelancholy	How ugly are you? Why don't you think you can improve your looks?
EternalMelancholy	People can't understand something they haven't experienced themselves.  I understand you.
EternalMelancholy	You can always talk to us.  You say that you've lost interest in nearly everything you used to love. What have you used to love? And is there anything in this world that could make you happy?
EternalMelancholy	I've read everything that you've written. I understand you.  Have you tried talking with someone besides your Mum and Dad? Holding all those emotions locked up inside you is terrible.
EternalMelancholy	Can you tell me a few examples of that experience? And what reinforces it?
EternalMelancholy	Why do you think you're not worthy of love?
EternalMelancholy	Do you consider yourself as attractive or unattractive? Why?
EternalMelancholy	They simply don't understand. You cannot understand something you haven't been through.
EternalMelancholy	I don't know how to help you. I can just say that I understand you.
EternalMelancholy	I think most of us do. If we didn't, we probably wouldn't be here.
EternalMelancholy	I think it is possible for you to come back. Emotions are hard. Feeling is hard. Being numb to everything is a defence mechanism.   Do you have anything that makes you happy?  What do you think would make you happy?  Follow those things. I think you will stop feeling numb and will end up feeling something again.
EternalMelancholy	Nirvana, Radiohead, VNV Nation.
EternalMelancholy	Nothing lasts forever. All emotions, no matter how intense, fade away over time. Even life itself will eventually fade away. Don't stress yourself too much.
EternalMelancholy	I agree with you. I think that *most* people care primarily about appearance. But I also think that there are people who don't consider appearance to be the most important thing. I know that, because I'm one of those people.
EternalMelancholy	But what do you think are the contributing factors? Lack of social skills? Social anxiety? Maybe even some other mental disorders?
EternalMelancholy	Ok.  But you still didn't answer the second question: Why do you think it's the end of the world if you don't make it?
EternalMelancholy	And what do you think prevents you from having sex? Is it just your physical attractiveness?
EternalMelancholy	Why do you think that you'll never make it?  And even if you don't make it, why do you think that is a reason for your life to end?
EternalMelancholy	Monks can be people filled with nothing but pure joy, completely content with their lives.  Why do you want sex? Because of the pure physical pleasure or because of something else?
EternalMelancholy	Those things don't make you unlovable. Even if most people don't consider you sexually attractive, it still doesn't make you unlovable.  Have you ever read books? Have you ever become so immersed in a book that you "fall in love" with the author, even though you don't even know how that person looks like and is probably dead for a long time?   Humans are biological beings. They have their instincts and urges. But besides that, humans are also spiritual beings. Love is about connection. Lust is about physical attractiveness. Always remember that.
EternalMelancholy	You said you're "basically every unattractive thing about my gender that can't be changed".   What exactly are those things? Can you describe them?
EternalMelancholy	Does anyone want to talk with me? | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	I'm lonely. | [removed]
EternalMelancholy	It depends on whether you act on them or not. Thoughts are just thoughts. Nobody, not even the best psychiatrists can know what's inside your head. You can be suicidal for your entire lifetime and if you don't tell anyone, nobody will ever know.  Don't worry. Being sad is ok. Being depressed is ok. Even having suicidal thoughts is ok. We're all just human beings.
EternalMelancholy	I think that accepting the fact that we're all useless and that our existence doesn't matter is the first step towards feeling liberated.  We don't matter and nothing really matters. So what?  What really matters is sunsets and sunrises, nights full of stars, realization of how small and insignificant we are compared to the vast infinity of the universe and...feeling of love.  From this perspective I can say that depression should not be fought. It should be accepted. It is there for a reason. It is part of who we are.  We should just try to make our lives more comfortable, more bearable, without the sheer horror of complete and utter misery and loneliness.  I'd like to talk with you. However, I'm a much better listener than talker, not because I'm unable to express myself well, but simply because I don't have much to say.
EternalMelancholy	Well, I think you have only options:  1. Meet new people 2. Accept those elitists and try to fit in with them 3. Be alone and accept it  There really isn't anything other you can do. I don't personally know you, nor do I know your situation, so I can't tell you what exactly should I do. You probably know that much better than me.  Whatever option you choose, good luck!
EternalMelancholy	You can try finding different 'different' people. Not all 'different' people are the same.  Also have you tried accepting their bullshit interests? Because if everyone only made friends with people who have all the same interests as them, everyone in this world would be completely alone.
EternalMelancholy	Maybe becoming a writer will give my life a meaning, who knows?  I never liked the conventional mental health system where therapists tell people that "things aren't as bad as they seem", "it will get better", "there is always light at the end of the tunnel".  People have to realize that they are going to die and that there is basically nothing they can do about it. Imagine having a condition called "life" for which there is no known cure and that you have at most a few decades left, maybe not even that much.  What's the worst thing that could happen? That you die?  If you look at life from that perspective, you realize that nothing is actually that terrible and that you have to make the most out of it.   I like to thing of life as a dream. No matter what, you're going to wake up. So at least try to enjoy it while it still lasts.
EternalMelancholy	It's my own personal philosophy, so it doesn't really have a name. Maybe it will, if I manage to write a book one day. But basically, it's mostly absurdism. In other words - "the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any."  Nobody can tell you how to live your life and what to do with it. You have to find that out by yourself.  Do you know what makes you happy? Do you have any values that you consider important?  Those are the things that are worth living for.  But that's actually the hardest part. Like I've said countless times before - It's not the fight itself that bothers me. I'm a fighter and I don't give up easily. It's finding the things that are worth fighting for.  Once you find those things, you will find a meaning. Things will make sense again. And you will finally be able to feel joy.  But of course, that's easier said than done.
EternalMelancholy	Have you tried accepting your own mortality and realizing that your life and life of everyone else is going to end? And that at the end, nothing will really matter.  No past and no future, just endless and eternal *now*.  Just stop caring about anything. Accept the pointlessness, accept the loneliness. And you will feel...content.
EternalMelancholy	Well, you actually can't.  The only way to be completely sure is to find a way to talk with him. Tell him how much you care about him and that you're really confused and don't know what to do about your relationship. If he doesn't want to respond, I don't think there's anything else you can do.
whims-and-worries	You could take it to collections, I believe? It's small enough to be a small collections deal and big enough to matter.
whims-and-worries	How do I appropriately look for a higher paying job? | Hello! I just moved to California and found myself a nice CNA job at a hospital. They are currently paying me about the same as my very first hospital starting rate despite having two years of experience and working nights, but because I was just desperate to find a job, I accepted. The company and staff has been very nice to me, but I would like to find a job somewhere that pays more. How can I go about doing this?  What's the appropriate time to work at my first job? I was thinking about a year.  How do I fill out applications/attend interviews with the intention of learning what they pay me from the start?  What can I put on my resume to indicate why I left my current job, if I do end up finding a higher paying job?  Any advice would be great! Thanks :) 
whims-and-worries	Just keep at it! The squeaky wheel gets the oil. If you're friends and have access to his family, like his mom, maybe send her a message and even let her know too! Don't harass his family, just harass him, but maybe that might push him? 
whims-and-worries	Oh dear :( well, maybe you can just keep hounding him about it. Call him every week to remind him!
whims-and-worries	i feel like i cant breathe | All I every do is worry about money. I worry and worry about payments and rent and I feel like I'll never have enough money. I don't know how to stop. I can't keep feeling like this, it's killing me
whims-and-worries	I like the fridge and the painting part. It's just...tiny details, memories being jumbled with other memories, the small things that she's forgotten. It's so strong. And the faces being blank too.
whims-and-worries	[request] Hungry and broke | Hi, I could really use something to eat that isn't beans, rice, and Chicken. I've got so much stuff to do and no time to do it, so any dinner help for me and my sisters would be appreciated.
whims-and-worries	...well, no further questions :0
whims-and-worries	I USE PEBBLES IN ALL OF MY DEEEEECORATIIIIING
whims-and-worries	I'd try to stray from marijuana for a while, or at least turn to more regulated forms of it. As for the rest, I'd cut that girl out of your life and go see some medical professionals. The good thing is, if it's an STD there's a chance you can get some antibiotics to treat it. If it's more serious, there are ways to live with it. Get some psych help with that awful PTSD, you've had it rough but I know that you'll pull through despite it all. You've made it this far, you're tough and strong and you will be ok!  Kisses. Smiley face. :) 
whims-and-worries	Ravioli. Yeah.
whims-and-worries	Go eat a popsicle and sit down. Trying to be deep and shit. You're just encouraging unhealthy thoughts. If you're suicidal, don't drag other people down too, that's just attention whoring. Christ.
whims-and-worries	Yes that was me!! Sorry, I totally forgot to sign the cards :l I'm so glad you liked it!!!
whims-and-worries	PsBattle: Hiker casually looking over her shoulder. | 
whims-and-worries	I want a Halloween card!! I want to dress up as something easy and cute so I'm going to get a witch hat and wear it with my striped tights. How about an exchange? :D
whims-and-worries	You're welcome!!!
whims-and-worries	Bless you.
whims-and-worries	They need the antannae to hear the sound of crinkly snacks being opened two rooms away.
whims-and-worries	Nice!! Even if she doesn't text you I'll bet she's super flattered. It sounds like everything was super smooth, so don't be embarrassing!! 
whims-and-worries	Bring your small dogs to the Riverwalk dog park...Mack wants to play!!! | 
whims-and-worries	This is on Pierce street!! It's called the Riverwalk Bark Park :) come early, like around 8 when everyone comes in and it's not so hot!
whims-and-worries	Bring your little dog to the Riverwalk dog park...Mack wants to play!!! | 
whims-and-worries	Shut your whore mouth and tAKE MY MONEY
whims-and-worries	Can confirm. Bought a pack of thin Oreos, immediately began serial killing.
whims-and-worries	I've been coming around 8, when the weather is nice and there's lots of dogs running around :) !
whims-and-worries	Look at those weird lil legs, mate!
whims-and-worries	French bulldog!! 
whims-and-worries	They both have those funny satellite ears :)
whims-and-worries	Just come hang out at the park and play with everyone else's! 
whims-and-worries	Aw, play hookey and bring your pupper anyways!
whims-and-worries	It looks lovely!
whims-and-worries	Ya pie! I like that.

whims-and-worries	This is what I imagined the roads like :) 
whims-and-worries	Is Miss Mia still taking cards? I'd love to send her one :) 
whims-and-worries	You could always post a little picture of Mia or Mia's parent with a paper saying the subreddit, the username, and maybe the date! Actually, it would be nice for all parties to have verification!
whims-and-worries	There was a point where he stopped freaking out, cocked his head, laughed, then went back to freaking out before he sat down and I bet your ass he just made a killer dad joke right then.   
whims-and-worries	"hi cum dump"  ...okie dokie then.
whims-and-worries	but did you tip him?

whims-and-worries	:D
whims-and-worries	Awkward skin condition | So...this has been a thing since I was a little girl.  I've always been a little chubbier, but recently I've been good about my health and have lost about 10lbs. I say a little because my weight has never been on the extreme spectrum but I've always been chubbier. I eat right and go to the gym and feel good, but my thighs have always touched and rubbed. I chalked it up to sensitive skin being bothered by the sweat and friction.   Basically, between my legs, on the sides of my thighs, down to between the buttocks, I have these purple splotches that sometimes range from small and red (like razor burn) to large cysts that are painful and have to be drained or treated with a compress. I try not to pick at my skin, so that's not really an issue, but it doesn't seem to go away.  Do any of my chubby friends have this same problem?? Is it an infection or just a skin condition? I know it's not an STD because I have been tested. It's the only part of me that I truly can't stand. Thanks for any feedback.  EDIT: Please don't say to go to a doctor. Of course I've been to doctors sillies, you think I would rely on the internet for help? Of course not ya goofs! I was just wondering if anyone's had a similar skin problem and if certain things helped it.
whims-and-worries	Alright, take it down a notch. Thank you for your contribution.
whims-and-worries	Flashing Lights by Kanye West. Idk sometimes I feel like I'm slow motion walking down a red carpet when that song plays.
whims-and-worries	Its not really a hobby as much as a pipe dream, but I would buy some land and run a dog foster home, particularly for old or special needs puppers. And maybe some cattos too, we'll see! I'd love to care for animals who need good homes, and invite students over for education and community service and find good homes for them. 
whims-and-worries	Dude don't worry about the tiffany blue, I think it looks AWESOME, and is a great change from the barn red!!! So cute, I want a small army of chickens.
whims-and-worries	Yah I'm slowly losing weight and trying to get in shape but I'd still like a doctor to tell me what it is exactly. 
whims-and-worries	Whoa, awesome!!! I'll have to bring up the name to a doctor to see if they agree, I'd love to have a name for this ridiculous skin condition :l has yours cleared up in terms of the skin marks and splotches and stuff?
whims-and-worries	No, no he's not dead! He's exploring. I mean, I hope :(
whims-and-worries	This is so helpful, thank you! Yeah, my thighs and inner buttock are supper scarred and ugly and now I'm getting fitter and feeling very confident in my appearance, but it's like the only thing on me that I don't really love. It makes me very self conscious but I'm so glad there are ways to help it.
whims-and-worries	Yeah, I've visited a few doctors and a dermatologist but they've always given me a tube of cream stuff and told me to lose weight, and I'm getting there!! Im just a little concerned if I need antibiotics or something. Soon I'm going to see an OB GYN for the first time about this issue, so maybe they'll have something new to say.
whims-and-worries	That teal is just a pantydropper. I'm sorry. I have no other way to describe it. Your eyelids literally make women drop their panties. They're perfection!! 
whims-and-worries	[Thank You] Da_kine85, Amicableuser, & Anon_suzy! | Thank you guys for my beautiful postcards from Texas, Hawaii, and Canada!! They were all beautiful and it made my entire week to open my mailbox and receive them :) I'm rounding up some cards from my favorite places in California, like Oceanside, San Diego, Temecula, La Jolla, LA, and Hollywood, so once I grab some y'all will be the first to get one!!  
whims-and-worries	[Vent] Thanks r/dogs for helping me cope with my dog's death. | It's been a few months since my guy, Scooby, was put down. I stew over it for hours every night and I lose sleep over him sometimes. My dad was even more heartbroken than I was because they were inseperable, and he off handedly said that he thought we were putting him down because he was an 'inconvenience' and he hated that. I didn't think that at first, I thought that because he started getting really sick really fast and had heart failure, it was his time and the vet agreed, but I can't help wonder if it really was just because it was 'inconvenient'.   I miss him so much. I'm only 20 and we've been together for 13 or 14 years. When he died I felt like that was the last piece of my childhood that was gone, because we moved from my childhood home, my old friends are in different states, and the places we used to go to are so different now. But I read happy stories about all of your dogs and I feel better. And I can't think about Scooby without remembering the kind tips and words from all of you on r/dogs, and the vets and techs at the clinic we went to. You guys especially supported me when he was first diagnosed with cancer and I needed tips to fatten him up and keep his energy high since he was getting thin and tired.   I miss him so much. Fuck man. 
whims-and-worries	I don't think I can ever have another dog. Watching him get old and die was probably one of the worst things I've ever experienced, even if the rest of our time together was happy. I don't know if my heart could take another round of that.
whims-and-worries	*water splashes in canoe*  "WET?!?!?"  *doggo jumps in water*  "MORE WET?!?!!!!"  *gets pulled out and plopped back in canoe*  "...wet :c "  
whims-and-worries	My life will probably go along the lines of marrying rather young to the first person that even half tolerates me, popping out a few puppies despite me not wanting any kids, hating my spouse as the kids are growing up but staying with them for the kids, getting divorced around the time the kids graduate high school, living alone because the kids like my ex spouse more than they like me, and then blowing my brains out around my mid life crisis.   I feel it. My dad is slowly going down that path, though I pray he never kills himself, and I'm so like him I'll probably do the same. 
whims-and-worries	[Request] The Call for Postcards Heard Round the World!!! [California] [US] | Hey hi!! My goal is to some day travel to every Continent, every country in the world and I want to see some beautiful lil postcards! If you have any cool postcards from ANYWHERE, I'd love to receive one and I'll send one back :D  
whims-and-worries	All of them are 6mg and are all either completely new or slightly used. Locally made in Las Vegas I believe.  New - $25: Desert Cowboy  Afterglow Berry Blend Cryoglow   Slightly Used - $15: Cereal Consequences  Secret Weapon ($10)
whims-and-worries	E-Liquids for Sale!!! | 
whims-and-worries	Eh, sometimes if I'm lazy I'll put it on while I'm blending it but if I'm specifically down for a bright exciting eye lid, ill be a little more careful and do the primer instead!!  
whims-and-worries	Listen to this veteran of baking. As a veteran of baking, this baking veteran knows what he's talking about. He is a veteran. A baking veteran. He veterans baking. 
whims-and-worries	Give that lady a smooch on the hand for me!
whims-and-worries	CCW: My neutral every-day look FT the sun in my eyes | 
whims-and-worries	Listen to the veteran! He's a veteran, not a rookie, and as a veteran, he deserves to veteran baking. The baking veteran. The veteran baker. You gotta know your place rookie, this guy is a veteran and he's beteran you, as a baking veteran. 
whims-and-worries	I don't know how, but I was legitimately turned on by the thought of this cake.
whims-and-worries	Shhh he sleep
whims-and-worries	Heh, my foundation is way too light for me :L I just realized it today since I've been tanning little by little, but it is just NOT my tone 😓
whims-and-worries	You can also use them as eyeshadows! NO RULES IN THIS GAME
whims-and-worries	Oo, like a light lavender and a baby blue and blending them together to just mermaid perfection!!!
whims-and-worries	A good eyelid primer and a pale base color! There are a million primers in a million price ranges so experiment with different brands. Don't use concealer or foundation, as it makes your eyes crease quite a bit. And swipe on a pale base color to layer your regular colors over!!
whims-and-worries	Sitting alone and crying because something feels impossible...and doing it anyways.  My childhood dog died. I failed my college classes. I was in the middle of moving from Florida to California for family reasons, then suddenly my family wants to move back to Florida after I quit my wonderful job, turned in my moving letter to the landlord, and told everyone I was leaving. I cried for two days and it felt impossible, but I did it anyways and I love living where I am, found a new job I'll be starting soon, and am slowly meeting new friends. If it doesn't feel like it's impossible, it's not worth doing. *If it doesn't feel like it's impossible, it's not worth doing.* I keep telling myself that and it really helps me take leaps into new things. 
whims-and-worries	Practice practice and practice. Watching tutorials from people with my similar eyeshadow and experimenting with different products. I find that with double hooded eyes, I keep the wing small and cute and the line very tight. I try to take tips from MUAs on YouTube and Insta with an eyeshape as close to mine as possible.
whims-and-worries	http://m.imgur.com/qT2sF0G  There's a delightful lil chart!! As for colorful eyeliners I don't know any in particular, BUT I do know that I've seen some people use damp brushes and eyeshadows for eyeliner and even eyebrows! 
whims-and-worries	Shade shape tape took me a few tries to say...
whims-and-worries	Is shaving my eyebrows between threading okay?? I usually keep the shape in check with some tweezers and shave off the baby stray hairs with an eyebrow razor. Does this damage my skin or brows?
whims-and-worries	Product list:   **Face:** Aveeno moisturizer, CoverGirl Clean liquid foundation in Ivory aka WAY too light for me these days, ELF contour palette for setting color, NAKED Flushed Palette for contour, blush, highlight.  **Lips:** Nyx intense butter gloss in Tres Leches  **Eyes:** Essence superfine liquid liner, ELF baked eyeshadow, Rimmel London Wonderlash with Argan Oil  **Brows:**  ELF Lock On brow cream in Espresso  **Setting Spray:** Heritage Stone Rosewater because im boujee 
whims-and-worries	That's pretty ridiculous man. The bright red shirt and Comcast van would be a dead giveaway. 
whims-and-worries	Really nice!!! All I can suggest is the brow shape and maybe carving out the lines with concealer, and maybe a more nude toned lipstick. The colors blend beautifully and your eyeliner is impeccable 👌
whims-and-worries	How did you get them so vibrant??? Beautiful!! 
whims-and-worries	Fire? | I have a police scanner app and it sounds like there's a brush fire somewhere in Riverside. Anybody know what's the deal? I hope everyone is okay!
whims-and-worries	So where was her son when she was lifting? I guess a kiddy room? Hopefully he was hanging as a weight like a monkey :3
whims-and-worries	What's your scariest home-alone story? | 
whims-and-worries	Hey Jim....weren't you on an episode of Malcolm in the Middle? I swear that was you tormenting Francis in the truck while he's hitchhiking!
whims-and-worries	What a dick.
whims-and-worries	Idk | I'm tired. Everyone is bitter and angry and I'm scared and tired. There's no more happiness in me and the world is so dark now. I feel like it'll never feel light again. Idk.
whims-and-worries	I mean it's pretty true. America doesn't like chubby girls. No, not people who's size hurts themselves and others with their progressively worsening health problems, but just... Kind of chubby girls. And guys too. If you have a tummy or a fupa you are deemed less than, and people always try to say "oH buT tHE HeaLTH prObLemS" but STFU. People don't care about other peoples health, they just want to validate their own prejudice.  I'm tired and bitter. I don't know. Everyone is so beautiful and I'm so tired of seeing so much anger in the world and I'm so tired. Idk. 
whims-and-worries	I have no idea what message you were trying to send here, but, uh, thanks!! I appreciate your support (?). At least I'll have my 8 golden retrievers to keep me company while I die alone haha 
whims-and-worries	I always need to see comments like this. I'm pretty chub myself, and sometimes I think I look kinda nice when I do my hair and makeup and wear my nice clothes, but it's good to remind myself that no one will ever find me attractive and I'll probably die alone. 
whims-and-worries	Is it too late now to say sari
Secretredditaccount_	I've just finished all my suicide letters. | I've been thinking about what to say and have been walking around with them half finished for a while now. I'm going to wait a week, and if things don't change, then I'm flying to California. Getting a hotel. And hanging myself. I'm not looking for anyone to try and change my mind. I'm just putting it out in the universe. I wish everyone the best, I wish you all luck in all your choices, I wish I was loved more.   I'll post updates about my trip. Hopefully it'll help science or someone else or whatever.   
Secretredditaccount_	If my husbands decides he wants a divorce or not. It'll be the final straw. The last heartbreak. I just cannot anymore. I've failed at everything I've ever done. This will be my last. I'm 28. I'm just done with the world. And I'm okay with that. 
Secretredditaccount_	FRENCH TOAST
Secretredditaccount_	Good bot 
Secretredditaccount_	Ha! Yup. 
Secretredditaccount_	How come? And thank you for the advice. 
Secretredditaccount_	I've always wanted to live there. I might as well reside for a couple days, finish out my last dream. 
forsakenlonely	I'm tired of being alone! | I've been divorced for three years now and I still haven't had a relationship. I have some really good friends, but they all live in other states. I talk to them when they can but I just crave the physical closeness, not sexually but just knowing that a living person in this area wants to hang out with me.   I became friends with two girls locally, but they are just using me for rides and as a sounding board for their own problems. At one point I had a chance with either of them, but now I've been relegated to the permanent friendzone and will never get out of it. I don't have anyone else around that I am close to. I pay an insane amount of money per month in child support as well which severely limits my options on moving or fuck just surviving if I'm honest, certainly don't have funds to date. On top of that I have social anxiety and I know I'm depressed. I l also work from home, so sometimes I won't see anyone at all. I'm suffering from insomnia now for months I average about 15-20 hours a week. I'm almost delirious by the time most people go to bed. By 1am I'm dying from the crushing loneliness of my situation. By 3am I'm in tears wishing I had an out. I'm not suicidal, I don't want to die. I love my kids and I would never do that to them. But fuck sometimes it seems that it would be easier if I just wasn't here anymore.   I know I have problems and I'm trying to deal with them. But I can't afford to go to the doctor. I don't qualify for any govt assistance or other programs. I don't have anyone here that will actually give a shit about me if I was sick or sad or hurt.   I just am worried that three years out of my marriage and I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. I just want someone who wants to hang out with me and not just use me, or judge me. What the fuck? I'm the perennial nice guy that always gets fucking dumped on.  It's only 7:45pm here and I can already feel the loneliness spreading across my abdomen and creeping into my chest to strangle my heart.   I know this is all disjointed and makes no sense to anyone at all but me, but fuck I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I tired of being like this. I sick to death of spending every day and night by myself, only hearing from people locally that want something from me.   Sorry this is such a messed up post. It's a throwaway obviously.
throwaway5545466	yeah i only do it on the weekends though bc i have classes on the weekdays...
throwaway5545466	18 yr old college student and completely isolated | hey sorry if this seems rambling i just don't have the patience to read through this again. I just started college and few weeks ago, and even though most of my classes are easy, i'm depressed. i haven't had a real friend since middle school, so i'm really out of practice when it comes to being social. i'm completely alone. i just really need to vent right now sorry. the only thing that makes me happy is doing hw and eating... pathetic but true. sometimes i stay up really late just so that i can wake up late (like noon) and say "atleast the day is almost over". fuck sorry if this is rambling but i can't articulate my thoughts right now because my mind is spinning
KingTheropod	I can't take it any more. This is the lowest I've been | I recently betrayed the trust of one of my close friends and it's really bearing on me. I thought about suicide before, but now it's almost every other thought. I take some solace that I was on LSD while it happened, but the fact of the matter is I fucked up. I'm a horrible person and don't deserve this life
KingTheropod	[REQUEST] Can anyone help me get some pieces to look like the Engineer from Tf2 for my MCH? | 
KingTheropod	What kind of filtration are you using?
KingTheropod	Theodore
KingTheropod	[Recruiting][Any Server][Code: AJF9DSC3] | I play on Coeurl, but I have nothing to offer new players yet so you are free to choose whatever server you want!
KingTheropod	No. I tried to get a little too close to my friend
KingTheropod	Hell yeah I do! I want to suck them and use them as pillows too!   Very nice 👌
KingTheropod	5e Wizard familiar | So I've been playing my first Wizard and have been really enjoying him. He was given a Psuedodragon as a gift and I was wondering if having a familiar is any good.
KingTheropod	I mostly got it because I like Psuedodragons and asked. But Nagaina will be of great use!
KingTheropod	Oh shit! That's awesome
KingTheropod	Need some tank help | So I've been given a nice large jar from work. We used to use it to sell bulk dried peppers, but they are getting rid of a lot of stuff to make room. I took it thinking I can use it as a first time betta enclosure.  It holds about 1.5 gallons of water, but the betta care sheet recommends 5 gallons. Should I just buy a 5 gallon betta kit or would I be ok with the jar?
KingTheropod	Would I still need the Find Familiar spell?
KingTheropod	DRAW!
KingTheropod	Had some help stocking the shelves | 
KingTheropod	Is it possible to have a flight suit? (or something similar) | 
KingTheropod	I want to have this set up one day! Or at least a similar set up with a betta 😊
KingTheropod	I play Mono Green Stompy and BW tokens in modern, but I have a real fondness for tribal. Slivers is something I've always wanted to play
KingTheropod	Had some help stocking the shelves | 
KingTheropod	What size tank is he in? And does he have any tank mates?
KingTheropod	Rope fish!!! Love those guys
KingTheropod	That's awesome!!!
KingTheropod	I do
KingTheropod	Need help restoring account | I just recently got a new iPhone and need help getting my old account that I started on my old Android. I'd rather not do all of the stuff over again. Every time I start it up, it makes me go through the tutorial.
KingTheropod	He looks like a Chad to me
KingTheropod	As soon as I saw this scene, all I could think of is Scout
KingTheropod	I'll try raising them separately until they get big enough.
KingTheropod	http://mytriops.com Relevant site if you don't know what Triops are
KingTheropod	Betta ad Triops | Was curious if it was possible to keep a betta housed with Triops. I haven't heard too much about it and was curious since I've been thinking of getting a betta and also trying to raise Triops.
KingTheropod	Been thinking of getting Triops | I was in my local hobby store and noticed they still sell Triops kits. I was always curious about them and used to think about getting some when I was a kid, but never did. However now that I've seen the kits I was thinking about grabbing a kit and trying to raise them.  So as a newbie, what do I need to raise Triops? I have a spare 10 gallon tank that I'm not using.
KingTheropod	Link please
KingTheropod	THOSE WINGS THOUGH. They are beautiful! Great job!!!
KingTheropod	Anguirus, Titanosaurus and Varan. I'd like to see some of the "unpopular" kaiju get some love.
KingTheropod	Could be a caldera od an inactive volcano.
KingTheropod	The ability to close doors. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've been in a stealth situation and have said to myself "man I wish I could close this door behind me."
KingTheropod	I know it's stuff I can listen to on YouTube or just get it from the game files, but eh. I bought a CD. 
KingTheropod	Getting my first army ready, gonna play some Beastclaw Raiders! I was wondering: which ranged weapon is better: the blood vulture, or the chaintrap?
KingTheropod	"Hey girl"
KingTheropod	I thought that too, but after doing a bit of research I think he might have DGI. 
KingTheropod	My Dwarf Gourami is just sitting at the top of my tank. He doesn't move much, and I haven't seen him eat. I'm worried about him | 
KingTheropod	August of 2016. He was one of the first fish I got for the tank  
KingTheropod	He's in a 29 gallon tank with 6 Blackskirt Tetras, 4 Panda Cories and a Bristlenose Pleco if that helps.
KingTheropod	So I'm still pretty new to this whole Hobby and I had some questions about basing. I just recently purchased the Icewibd Assault box and was wondering if it would be better to leave my big creatures unbaced while painting, or just base it and worry about that detail later? Well I would like to paint the undersides of them, but I feel like that would be a wasted effort since no one would ever look there. Thoughts?
KingTheropod	Thanks! You did a great job!
KingTheropod	You look GREAT
KingTheropod	I volunteer  ;)
KingTheropod	I will fight that pillow
KingTheropod	Nice! I like that shade of brown for the big beasts I'm working on my Icewind Assult and had a few questions. Did you leave the harnesses off to paint them separately? And did you paint the Stonehorn's head separate from the body?
KingTheropod	These heads WORK. Good job
KingTheropod	That looks great!
KingTheropod	Thought I was gonna play 40k first....then I got convinced to buy this beast! Can't wait to get started! | 
KingTheropod	I love the eyes. Very white walker feel. Great job!
KingTheropod	Yeah, but it's a good thing like painting :) 
KingTheropod	I still really want to play 40k (I love the Tyranids so much), but AoS definitely looks like it's easier as far as rules go
KingTheropod	Correct!
KingTheropod	It's still a mix here. Though it seems like there are more AoS players
KingTheropod	Jealous of this set up.
KingTheropod	That's gorgeous! Great work
KingTheropod	Working on my Broodlord. Trying to copy by friend's paint job he did for me. Any tips? | 
KingTheropod	He has what he did written down, I've just never painted anything before and it's a little intimidating. I have no idea how I'm going to do the claws and scything talons 
KingTheropod	It must be a pain to arm wrestle with him. I imagine that claw hurts XD  He looks great
KingTheropod	That molly photobomb...
KingTheropod	NOW DIS IZ A RIGHT PROPER ORK! WAAAAGH!!!  Good job dude
KingTheropod	What's this kid's name? He's a cutie!
KingTheropod	If I add adrenal glands or flesh hooks to a model, do I have to use the little bits as well? 
KingTheropod	I've noticed that the Hive Tyrant head is different from the Swarmlord's head while putting together my Tyrant. Does it matter if I use the regular Tyrant's head for the Swarmlord, or does it even matter? Simply asking just in case it matters in the future.
KingTheropod	I like that green on green! Great job!
KingTheropod	I'm trying to understand the Independent Character rule in Warhammer 40k. While I understand the character can join other units, does it also mean that they can be in a unit by themselves? It makes sense given the rule's name, but the rulebook doesn't really go into that.
KingTheropod	I think you did good. The little spines on the tail could be colored though
KingTheropod	WICKED! Good job dude
KingTheropod	He looks great. That base is GORGEOUS
KingTheropod	I see. Thanks for your help!
KingTheropod	What would you recommend grabbing for armor? I've considered swapping out the Guard for a Lictor, but I'm not sure that's right.
KingTheropod	I'm a little unsure on the Ripper Swarms now that I look at the list. That's 57 points I could use to make a unit better or just a different unit all together.  Edit: Went ahead and changed it to a Hive Guard. Luckily with Toxin Sacks, I even used up that random point I had!
KingTheropod	That pink/purple looks really good. Really catches the eye and looks good with the metallic gray color
KingTheropod	Wow...that's super spot on.
KingTheropod	Tyranid 500 point list | Hey guys. Finally sat down and took the time to plan out my first list before I buy any more models. Here's what I came up with.  * Tyranid Prime w/ Bonesword and Lashwhip and Deathspitter **150pts** * Tyranid Warriors w/ Scything Talons, Rending Claws and Adrenal Glands **120pts** * Termagaunts w/ Fleshborers, Adrenal Glands and 2 additional Termagaunts **62pts** * Hourmagaunts w/ Scything Talons and Adrenal Glands **60pts** * Zoanthrope **50pts** * Hive Guard w/ Toxin Sacks **58pts**  The army is mostly comprised of models I've already collected, assembled and had painted over the years. Some of my units might seem wonky because I didn't take into account the point values of some weapons. I'm still learning the actual game, so any feedback you guys can give me would be much appreciated.
KingTheropod	He looks like he's waving at me with his free rending claw hand. Hi buddy!  But in all seriousness, good job man.
KingTheropod	Trying to build a Tyranid Kill Team. Is having a Broodlord worth it? I'm just starting out and have no idea.
KingTheropod	How did you magnetize them?
KingTheropod	This is gorgeous. You did am excellent job
KingTheropod	What is the best way to put metal models together? Is there a specific glue?
KingTheropod	He has a goofy face and I think I love him. Is he freshwater? What size tank do you keep him in?
KingTheropod	Looks good! I'll keep that in mind for my Beastclaw Raiders!
KingTheropod	The Walkrant that isn't a Walkrant...I like it. Thanks for the help, dude!
KingTheropod	It's a resin one. It uses the old instructions that says it's metal though. I'll scour ebay for the wings and Flyrant legs 
KingTheropod	Thanks for the info. I have a Tyranid Prime painted and ready for my lower point games already, but I was just curious since I have an older Tyrant that didn't come with wings and was looking at putting him together.
KingTheropod	What did you use for that snow?
KingTheropod	Are Walkrants a viable choice for Tyranids? Or is it strictly Flyrant or nothing?
KingTheropod	This. Is. AMAZING!!! I want this for my games!
KingTheropod	Where did you get him?!
KingTheropod	Are Tyranid Ripper Swarms used at all? Trying to come up with my first low point list and was curious.
KingTheropod	Tyranids FTW
KingTheropod	I can hear Steve Irwin commenting on the Carnifex's size in my head.
KingTheropod	Those claws are WICKED
KingTheropod	Learning 40k with Tyranids | [removed]
KingTheropod	Glad I know to get some wings for my unassembled Hive Tyrant.  I've looked into getting Genestealer cults eventually. Dunno about stats, but it's something from fluff that u enjoy. While I'm down on getting Zoanthropes and Venomthropes, what are some good troop choices? I figure warriors are good since it's a synapse creature and people keep telling me Genestealers are great
KingTheropod	So Did I waste my money on buying the Warriors? I bought them exclusively for the lower point games
KingTheropod	What about the Tyranid Prime? I already have one made and ready to go. I've been told Warriors are crap in general, but would they work in a lower point list?
KingTheropod	Is the Flyrant good in the lower point games? I'm looking at starting our with at least a 500pt army. And what are some god troop choices? 
KingTheropod	DO IT
Brehcolli	damn thats crunchy | 
Brehcolli	Sometimes when I think of death I find the concept to be very comforting | One day it will be over. The sadness, the regret, the numbness. You will be released from the things that bother you. No more crushing weight on your back.  Just peace.
Brehcolli	try posting it to r/games as well
Brehcolli	shit's cray yo  i've had a relatively big pimple on my ballsack for like what, 5 years now? i tried popping it many times but the thing eventually became fucking indestructible and i'm pretty sure i'll die with it still being there
Brehcolli	thing is, when im trying to squeeze it that regular white thingy from the pimple slowly comes out trough a small gap but the pimple itself just wont pop, that's weird
Brehcolli	I want to have a different life  I don't want the current one, I want the current one to end
Brehcolli	not anymore, i hardwired my brain not to get attached to anyone
Brehcolli	the saddest people dont give a fuck  whether about themselves or others
Brehcolli	i have periods when i'm feeling ok, but that's because one semi good things happens to me and i tend to forget that everything else is shit  then i'm woke and just want to fucking die
Brehcolli	astroturfing?
Brehcolli	this is a cutscene
Brehcolli	don't worry, it's the best implementation of loot boxes in any game i've seen, they're only cosmetic and you can obtain them very easily, it feels like their purpose is rather to make you want to play more instead of buy them
Brehcolli	Darksiders II
Brehcolli	this got me so hyped for season 3
Brehcolli	to be fair thats waaaaaaaay better than the usual tattoo pics posted here
Brehcolli	that shit cray
Brehcolli	S C L A S S B O Y E
Brehcolli	ale po chuj mu to
Brehcolli	that's very satisfying actually
Brehcolli	could you link those jeans you speak of?
Brehcolli	Lee is the biggest victim of Kishi's writing
Brehcolli	this is the most relatable post i've seen here

Brehcolli	ITT: Life is shit
Brehcolli	question is did crystallizing stopped her aging process? what if when she comes out she'll look exactly the same?
Brehcolli	literally just came from r/onepunchman and thats the first thing i see
Brehcolli	because instead of letting people devaluate the meaning of the word they keep creating shitstorms
Brehcolli	made me hate multiplayer games more
Brehcolli	+200
Brehcolli	i've been scammed
Brehcolli	it's implied that if a shifter doesn't shift back for a long time he will eventually go mindless
Brehcolli	Oh, that's nothing. Just remember not to let others take control of your mood :)
Brehcolli	There were some examples throughout the manga, like Eren having problems with communicating the more he shifted and trying to eat the construction he previously built (experiments with Hange) or during his first fight with the Female Titan, when he had Annie pinned down for a moment he started having strong convulsions and said he will "devour" her after he's done beating her to a pulp
Brehcolli	You KNOW this one's real
Brehcolli	I'm awaiting the allocation of my 114 overdue alpha packs then
Brehcolli	the thumbnail looked like an usual balaclava, what
Brehcolli	I was always intrigued by Aot and back when I had only seen some tiny snippets of the anime I thought that the art style, the ominous atmosphere, the constant feeling of "this is much bigger than what we're being shown" - it was all superb, so I got hooked and here I am now. Shame he didn't stick around to experience the meaty parts of the story, but if he decides to be judgemental before getting familiar with the whole deal then that tells you something about what kind of person he is. I mean, it's kinda unreasonable to make absolute statements if you only bothered to read 1/4 of it all. Consequently, his opinion isn't of much value to you and you shouldn't get upset about it.
Brehcolli	the tamburino family
Brehcolli	good job *pats on back*
Brehcolli	> but Isayama has said she will be happy by the end of the story   where
Brehcolli	clearly you do
Brehcolli	there is 0 need for major romance subplots in this manga
Brehcolli	yeah, it happens when they are updating and you started a game before, I'm currently experiencing this as well. Don't have the season pass and managed to test out the dlc ops, Ela is really fun to use
Brehcolli	this sub is unbelievably bad
Brehcolli	more like 2
Brehcolli	I find your comment pretty hilarious since in that context the word kurwa means prostitute
Brehcolli	to samo tylko poprzedzam "żesz" ew. "nosz"
Brehcolli	Ela is a must have currently, her gun is really fun to use
Brehcolli	what rank are you?
Brehcolli	I guess it's mostly subjective so you're not particularly wrong 
Brehcolli	60 bucks for only 2 days of playing is money well spent?
Brehcolli	man... that's cold...
Brehcolli	i'm in actual disbelief at how unlucky this guy is
Brehcolli	jak Diego Costa
Brehcolli	nah, the stubble is too thick  at least from what we've seen already Eren seems to be rocking that prepubescent mustache
Brehcolli	tell me lies tell me sweet little lies 🎶
Brehcolli	why would they leave armin behind though?
Brehcolli	yep, but this just puts a clear image in your mind, if anyone was on the verge this probably solidified how shitty the case slot machine is
Brehcolli	probably you and an undefined group of other people
Brehcolli	so not worth it
Brehcolli	fav  Eren x Mikasa   Armin x Annie  Jean x Mikasa  Eren x Annie  worst   Eren x Levi, Mikasa x Levi *spits*
Brehcolli	Sniper's a good job mate
Brehcolli	What's in the canister?
Brehcolli	but those stealth farts though
Brehcolli	Balding
Brehcolli	I'm really starting to get bored of Ranked with the new, limited map rotation | It's only been a couple of days but I already feel myself getting tired of playing the same few maps over and over again
Brehcolli	then they'll think something's wrong with their nose
Brehcolli	doesnt "no death" kinda rule that out already?
Brehcolli	i bet there's a sub for this kind of comics
Brehcolli	Nah, I'm fairly sure it's because of the reduced map diversity
Brehcolli	Ranked feels super repetitive now, I can feel myself getting worn out 
Brehcolli	why
Brehcolli	That's what they want you to think
Brehcolli	how the fuck is this related to games
Brehcolli	or go play pubg or siege or anything else
Brehcolli	i tuck it in
Brehcolli	*puts on tinfoil hat* [Manga Spoilers](#s "nah fam, it's Eren vs Paradis now, expect him and Mikasa to duke it out soon, just not the way you expect it to")
Brehcolli	you're hating on Eren way too much man 😂
Brehcolli	yep, I'd love if that turned out to be true as well
Brehcolli	Care the explain what makes you dislike him so much?
Brehcolli	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdEQmpVIE4A
Brehcolli	> Honestly, I've liked the idea of Armin as the final boss for a while now. It would be very powerful.  that would be such a great direction god DAMN
Brehcolli	> If Armin, no, Paradis itself decides to go through with it and Eren is the only one who objects to it, that would mean a conflict with everyone he ever held dear. It'd also explain his even more depressed attitude.  And honestly, it would be such a crazily good twist. Just imagine all the emotions you would experience upon seeing Super Yaeger Bros vs Armin, Mikasa and the rest  ...what if the Walldians are the actual final bosses because they don't see the bigger picture? Like holy fuck, I'm imagining all these possibilities now and if Isayama actually set us up for Armin vs Eren as the last arc then that would elevate this manga to the absolute top 
Brehcolli	>Which means he's not with Paradis anymore.  I'm hyped as fuck for the next chapters
Brehcolli	this is what happens when a bunch of middle aged men tries to emulate teenagers and their environment
Brehcolli	As I said, I don't mind a 3D Fallout because New Vegas proved it can be done properly, besides Fallout is more about narrative and freedom of choice, It's still possible to pull it off in this genre.   I agree with the constant plugging of BoS and Supermutants. Feels like Bethesda is too reluctant to try to create new stuff which would fit into the game world so they opt to rely on already established stuff, but the key condition is that it has to FIT and be properly fleshed out. Creating new stuff doesn't mean they have to take a big fucking dump on the current lore. Just make the damn effort to explain stuff and neatly arrange it so both new and old fans are satisfied.
Brehcolli	so they can fuck up the lore even more, huh?
Brehcolli	serious motherfucking table flip
Brehcolli	Bottom line is: do you care about making a good game, are you passionate about it? Or does money come first?
Brehcolli	They can do great things with it, make a cohesive story which stays true to the previously established rules of the universe as shown by Obsidian. Or, as you suggest, they can be lazy, ignorant and show that they give zero fucks about the source material and opinions of fans who stuck with the franchise through all these years.  It's a matter of seeing Fallout as a unique setting, a franchise with rich history and respecting its authors or just another chance to produce an uninspired cash grab for people with short attention spans and who are too bored to care, like you.
Brehcolli	i think many people do

Cori97	I'm sorry I should've clarified! Basically, I was born without a Corpus Callosum which is the part of your brain that sends signals back and forth from the right and left hemisphere of your brain. I have terrible social anxiety and OCD that stem from the AgCC, and it really just cripples me. Like it's so hard for me to get close to anyone because I add no substance to conversation, it's hard to explain but you know how normally people can carry on conversations and add to it? I literally can't, my responses would be something along the lines of "oh I see" or "that's cool" or whatnot, I guess subconsciously I'm just so afraid of being judged for saying something stupid that I do the bare minimum so no one has anything to go off of to judge me. And I honestly don't know if the way I am is because of the AgCC or if I'm like this because of stuff that's happened in my past, I was diagnosed at birth and haven't talked about any of this with a doctor or counselor or anything. I just don't see the point, all I'd do is freeze up and not know what to say to them, so no one could help me. It would just logically be so much easier if I wasn't here though I guess. No one really notices me, I add no substance to conversation. I just really dislike every aspect of my life, I can't see it getting any better so I just don't want to have to drag through every day like this... It's brutal.    You're spot on about me wanting to connect with someone on a more meaningful level. That's really all I need, just one person who understands who I am and how I think. It just feels like no one understands though and that's what makes it so much more lonely...      Thank you for responding though, sorry if it's a lot to read and it's all over the place... this is the first time I've ever really talked about how I was feeling so it's probably pretty sloppy. 
Cori97	I literally have no one... | I've had really bad depression along with suicidal ideation since I was around 10 years old. Im 19 now. It's just getting unbearable. I have no one in my life I can come to for anything, I literally work, go home to my apartment and sleep until I have to work again. It's my own fault, I have Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum which basically makes me socially inept. Like, I can talk to people at work if it's necessary otherwise I don't talk unless someone speaks to me first. I guess I'm just stubborn but it's just extremely hard for me to open up, I just don't see the point in conversing with people when I don't matter to them at the end of the day. So I basically dug myself in a hole because I refuse to open up to anyone, and left myself with nothing. I just  don't see myself in this world much longer. I really feel like I'm incapable of living. I've been through so much fucked up shit all my life  and I just really don't want to do this shit anymore. I don't even know how to explain everything, there's so much more too it than that but I just don't even know what to say. Everythings just so pointless though, there's no reason for me to be here. Only reason I'm still here is because I haven't found a reliable suicide method, as soon as I do though I won't hesitate to kill myself.   
littleliesinhereyes	How to save a life... | A person with suicidal thoughts is not normal... and they know it... For many a years they will fight to be normal try to do normal people things that make normal people normal though they don't know they are normal because being normal is everyday for them even when bad things happen to them the are simply cured by doing the normal things with other normal people. But we don't even have the normal things to rely on no regular friends who would come over for tea and a chat, a mad sesh on the town, or even a phone call, be it bffs, work or a an activity. And when they finally do travel so far down the lonely road with only their thoughts for company and jump, shoot, swallow and kick... everyone wonders why they never came to them I mean they would always be their if they asked it says so in the facebook post... Always here, are you ?😞😞😞😞😞 I would like to see five of my friends post this message (not sharing) to show that you are always there if someone needs to talk. I think I know who will xx #mentalhealthawareness  You can never be part of the normals when they finally learn how damaged and truly abnormal you are, talking doesn't help it just creates a toxic dependency that no side wants inclusion in the normals is all we want being part of the group being wanted and thought of when anything is going down helps so much people would probably live if the people in their lives helped them to live instead of remind them of how abnornal they are... I know this because I was pulled from a river after my fifth attempt the first public one so now the people closest to me know and still they leave me alone despite declarations of help and company being only a text or phone call away... They never reply... they never come and I am still barely here wishing to be normal but instead we are alone with our past, our pain and reality stop talking and start doing invite the weird kid from class to the cinema, the shy colleague to the work night out, the mom who never leaves the house because kids... just let them know you see them its all we want
revenger002	i don't know what to do | idk whats wrong with me, i feel nothing, i cant cry, i don't feel sad, i am completely Numb, sometimes am afraid that i won't even be able to care or being sad if i lose someone important to me, it's been like this for years but this year it's worse, i failed my exams last semester i didn't even study for them, on some of them i didn't even go to the examination room, and i don't feel sad or even worried.  my parents they love me soo much, i didn't tell them that i failed, i dnt want to disappoint them, the only think that keeps me from not committing suicide it's because of my family i dnt want them to be sad.  i had friends i just dnt talk to them anymore, i stay in my room 24/7, i just don't get out of it, i dont live with my parents, so they don't know about all these stuffs. i don't even know how i don't get sick literally i just eat 3/2 cookies per day, i only eat decent meal 1 a week, the rest of the week is just cookie/biscuit and tea i've been living like this for 3months  i really don't know what to do, because i failed my exams, i didn't go to school to see what i hav to do, if failed the whole semester or no, i don't know.  i just stay in my room and watch anime or movies etc,  i just wish i had the power to make everyone forget about me so i could just die without grief. the scariest part is the clock is ticking i can't stay like this, i have pretty much 1month to decide what to do, because the school might kick me out, i can't stay here because am not studying.   tbh my life has been a mess since 2013, i am one of the unluckiest person in the world.

that_uncreative_guy	crappy birthday to me... | so my birthday is almost over, it was supposed to help me forget the bullshit ive been going through lately but so far ive been cheated on, i crashed my car and im getting evicted... not to mention that i don't even have any money to go out to the bar and have a fucking drink with because the cheating bitch stole it.   i just want a hug 😢
that_uncreative_guy	i know how you feel. you can pm me if you need a friend i don't usually sleep so my inbox is always open 🖤 
sweet-squirrel	I don't want to die but I see no way to get better | People always say you're supposed to ask for help when you're suicidal and that it'll get better but I've been asking for help for 7 years and now no one knows how to help any more and it's still not better. I've been through mental health services, inpatient and outpatient, therapy, tried a bunch of meds and the only thing that helped was the meds I'm taking now but since I'm struggling now the doctors are saying that I should change my meds to another antipsychotic with horrible side effects and to an SSRI which have never helped before.   I'm honestly scared I won't survive a med change, I think my current meds are the only thing keeping me alive. I don't want to go back to the way I was before them, very suicidal, delusional, depressed, self harming and in and out of the police cells and inpatient all the time because of it.  I don't know what else I'm meant to do though, my mental health is deteriorating again and I'm feeling very stuck in my current life, being 24, single with no family or best friend, a shitty fast food job where I probably more money than doing what my qualification is in if I could get a job in it, no car and not much money saved because I haven't been able to hold down a job before these past 2 years. 
sweet-squirrel	I love the colours of it! How did you attach it to the wall?
sweet-squirrel	It's my birthday and I'm feeling down :( | 
sweet-squirrel	I've met a guy and he calls me princess and little and makes me feel subby and little.. how do I tell him I want him to be my Daddy? | He hasn't quite picked up on my hints yet and I'm not sure about asking directly but I'd love to call him Daddy 
sweet-squirrel	The earthquakes themselves are not the scariest part to me, but now there's been over 1000 aftershocks, tsunami warnings in place, billions of dollars worth of damage and 2 people have died. :( Not fun.
sweet-squirrel	[Not how it works here unfortunately :(](https://www.geonet.org.nz/quakes/felt)
sweet-squirrel	Trying to fall asleep after the big scary earthquake here last night :( Luckily no damage at my house | 
sweet-squirrel	Mine is the glittery purple one from [Onesies downunder](https://onesiesdownunder.com/collections/pacifiers). The glitter is on the inside of the plastic so there's no way it can get out. The quality is nice but it still feels weird if I have it in my mouth for a long time so I only use it for short periods.
sweet-squirrel	My new adult paci and jumper match my necklace! | 
sweet-squirrel	Thank you ♡
sweet-squirrel	Thanks you! And see my comment below :p
sweet-squirrel	Thank you ♡ It's from a shop called [Peter Alexander](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=peter+alexander&client=tablet-android-samsung&prmd=imvn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8jMOKifbPAhXGJpQKHQ04CCgQ_AUIBygB&biw=768&bih=1024#tbm=isch&q=peter+alexander+store)- a pajama shop that I think all littles would looove if it wasn't so expensive. I brought this top second hand though.
sweet-squirrel	New Shirt- ♡ Barbie | 
sweet-squirrel	Dunkaroos! They don't sell those here any more :(
sweet-squirrel	I found a little pink bodysuit while I was out shopping and I love it! | 
sweet-squirrel	Love my Minnie and Daisy Tsum tsums :) ♡ | 
sweet-squirrel	Got me some little treats and a squirrely outfit for my dolly :) | 
sweet-squirrel	I got some new stickers! | 
sweet-squirrel	The smiley ones look like Tubby Toast from the Teletubbies! I always wanted toast like that when I saw the show :P
sweet-squirrel	They're supposed to glow in the dark too! But I haven't tested them yet
sweet-squirrel	I'm a single little but I can still spoil myself! New stuffie (called Maisie), sippy and outfit for my dolly. | 
sweet-squirrel	Hey, I am a recently single little too and can relate to a lot of the feelings you've expressed in your post.   You know how you say you really want to be treated with lots of love? Well I am trying to wrap my head around the idea of providing myself with all that love instead of needing someone else to do it, and I think that could help you too. Who could be a better best friend to you than yourself, you share all the same thoughts, feelings and interests as yourself, and you're always there for you!   My counsellor who does not know I'm a little gets me to draw pictures sometimes with big crayons, about the idea of my 'adult self' taking care of and protecting my inner child, which really applies to us as littles I think. Maybe you could try that on your own?  Hugs to you anyways ❤
sweet-squirrel	You don't have to change your body to be or feel little. I'm 5'7, a size 8-10 US,  close to 200 pounds and an F cup with a curvy hourglass figure, but I'm lying in bed wearing a child's unicorn onesie and unicorn socks with my doll and sippy feeling little and cute. I'd rather hear that you learnt to love and appreciate your body the way it is than underwent surgery too change yourself.   And I'm sure that your body is probably great the way it is and doesn't need changing, all vaginas are awesome the way they are I think! (In fact I would think a big clit and labia would be beneficial rather than a bad thing)
sweet-squirrel	How do I explain that I'm a little and want a CG to prospective partners? | Subtle hints like sending them pictures of me in My Little Pony and Hello Kitty shirts and with my stuffies and saying I'm interested in BDSM haven't gotten the point across so I need a way to explain what being a little is and what I'm looking for without exposing evvvverrything at once cause it's still early days. Any ideas? Thankies x
sweet-squirrel	I have the same owl stuffie, he is called Twinkle, does yours have a name? Hope you feel better!
sweet-squirrel	New Hello Kitty outfit! Got a new onesie and outfit for my dolly too if you wanna see? | 
sweet-squirrel	I'm in the same boat, and I know it's hard coming on here and seeing all the posts about littles and daddies when you don't have one any more but still want to stay involved in community. 😟 Right now I'm just trying to do self care things for myself, keep distracted and spend time with friends and my dolly and stuffies. Still doing little stuff just not anything sexual cause I don't want to rush into another relationship.   If you want to talk or get some more ideas on what you can do feel free to message me. ☺
sweet-squirrel	I do but I don't have one, I just brought a little Chou chou doll though and I love her. I love buying new clothes for her too, I brought me and her some new outfits yesterday. 😊
sweet-squirrel	I'm having a real bad time, I think I have to report my ex-Daddy to the police | I don't think I ever told anyone here but he was abusive to me (including sexual abuse one night) and he said some really horrible things to me last night. He's got a new girlfriend now who has just come out of an abusive relationship so I'm worried that he'll hurt her. I'm really scared and sad and lonely though and it's hard cause I still love him and I kinda just don't want to be alive right now.
sweet-squirrel	My ex raped me and says he'll kill himself if I report him, what do I do? | So I've just come out of this relationship and am realizing how abusive and bad it was, and it's really affecting me. The problem is I didn't break up with him after the rape, I stayed with him until a few days ago because he said he'd change etc. The main reason we broke up is because he was having sexual conversations with 2 other girls and now he's in a relationship with a girl he's just met, who I'm worried about because she's been abused before too.  But anyway now that we are broken up the whole reality of being raped and the abusive things he did to me is really hitting me. I've told him this and he said I should report him at first, but then he switched into calling me a liar and verbally abusig me and saying I was making the whole thing up (he claims not to remember doing it because he was drunk), then he started trying to be all nice and friendly saying he's just a good guy who won't do it again. And then he said to tell him the day I report him so he can kill himself.   The way he turned on me like that and the way he immediately sought out another relationship with another girl that would be more vulnerable to abuse than the average person is really concerning to me and I now have no doubt that he could do it again, whereas up until now I thought he really would change. I do have lots of messages from him where he's called himself a rapist (to try and make me feel guilty) but I kept talking to him up until last night and I'm worried if I showed the police the messages as evidence they'd think I was lying because I didn't stop talking to him.  What do I do, please help me.
sweet-squirrel	I guess I wanted to make him understand how much he's hurt me and feel some remorse but I realized he doesn't care and just wants to get away with it, that's when I realized he's really a dangerous person. 
sweet-squirrel	I'm more worried about him being able to say I made it all up to get back at him because he was drunk and doesn't remember doing it, and that I'll look bad when I show them the messages as evidence because I kept talking to him and forgave him at first.   I don't really think his threats of suicide are credible I think they're just an attempt to manipulate me as another commenter said, because he knows how passionate I am about helping people with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts. And right now I'm the one who is suicidal when he's the one who hurt me which doesn't seem fair so maybe he kinda deserves to have the roles reversed.
sweet-squirrel	I do appreciate seeing your comments here, you always seem to try to comment on all the posts you can which is really nice when some posts don't get many or any other comments! But of course when you're sick and busy and stressed you just gotta take care of yourself and try relax when you get the chance. Hope you feel better soon ♡♡
sweet-squirrel	If only I had a bath 😟
sweet-squirrel	Mine left me too. 😢 It's really hard isn't it? Hope you're ok xo
sweet-squirrel	My dolly finally arrived! Her name is Harper. And I got a new stuffie too, I called him Twinkle | 
sweet-squirrel	Claw Grabby is an online shop here in NZ that sells lots of cute stuffies, stationery and other things from Japan, I brought my 2 alpacas from them and they sent me the sticker with my newest one. 😊

sweet-squirrel	My Daddy's nickname for me is baby squirrel too 😊 Hence my username.
sweet-squirrel	My new scooter helmet had a sticker that said 'thug' on it so I replaced it with some more appropriate ones (they got a bit wrinkly though :() | 
sweet-squirrel	Got myself some little treats today 😊 | 
sweet-squirrel	I found this on Aliexpress for about 10 USD, not sure how good the quality would be for that price but I'm tempted to try it for that price 😊
sweet-squirrel	I'm getting a dolly! I've wanted one of these ones since I was 9 sooo excited 😊 | 
sweet-squirrel	Hehe your stuffie is photo bombing you 😊 Cute pic 
sweet-squirrel	Thanks hehe I wanted one for aggges too before I finally found it at a decent price yay!
sweet-squirrel	Thank you! It's from Cotton On which is an Australian/NZ clothes shop but they do have an online store. ☺
sweet-squirrel	Thank you 😊💜
sweet-squirrel	There's always the option of not clicking on the very clearly labelled 'NSFW' posts, the subreddit even blocks the thumbnails for you so you don't have to see those if you don't want to. Littles are still grown adults and even though we have some childlike traits and interests, most of us still have adult interests too, hence our involvement here in what is a part of the BDSM community.
sweet-squirrel	Thank you 😃 It is still pretty comfy I slept in it last night and it was good 😊
sweet-squirrel	They're from a photo editing app called Pixlr 😊
sweet-squirrel	NSFW I love this cute lacy baby blue bodysuit, it even has snappy buttons | 
sweet-squirrel	It's just a cute butt with cute little PJs on it, body parts =/= porn. 
sweet-squirrel	I accidentally brought a child's unicorn onesie because it was in the adult section but I like it too much to return it! It's a wee bit tight but I fit into it | 
sweet-squirrel	Got another stuffie to cheer me up, can you help me name him? | 
sweet-squirrel	Thanks for all your nice comments on my other post. I don't have a Daddy any more, he's moving out today 😢 | I'm sad but it's ok because he wasn't being a good Daddy or good partner at all. Don't know if I'll find another, for now I just want to be on my own, take care of myself and let my heart heal. The hard part is we still love each other and he said he's worried about what I'm gonna do without a Daddy, but I'll be ok I'm a brave Little girl. 
sweet-squirrel	Heartbroken, he's been having dirty conversations with his ex. | Don't know what I'm gonna do now, need support
sweet-squirrel	My one was from Kmart but I live in NZ so I don't know if they have them in other countries. 
sweet-squirrel	Yay we have twin stuffies! 
sweet-squirrel	I decided to name her Jelly! Thanks for helping name her | 
sweet-squirrel	New underwear and sloth PJ shirt (NSFW) | 
sweet-squirrel	I need help naming my new friend! She's a girl | 
sweet-squirrel	I've been having trouble with my relationship too and I have the same problem, I find it easier to blame myself than to accept the fact that the other person is actually just being a butt (I would use a stronger word but don't want offend anyone here). I guess we just have to keep reminding ourselves that it's not our fault, even though it's really hard to. Hope you're ok ♡
sweet-squirrel	For me when I first got into DDLG I found myself wanting to call him Daddy and be in littlespace all the time and it was probably a bit much for him but now we've fallen into natural place where it happens sometimes but not others and I don't really need to call him Daddy that much because he just is Daddy... maybe you'll find something similar as time goes on?   I guess the messaging thing would be more of a separate issue that you might need to talk about, if you are willing to compromise and discuss it it shouldn't come off as you being clingy I don't think 
sweet-squirrel	I want some female friends! More about me in post text 23/F/NZ | Hi :) I'm looking to make friends with other girls, especially if you also live in NZ as most of my friends are guys with different interests to me. I'm into cooking and baking, makeup and fashion, scrapbooking and art, interior decorating, animals, trying to get fit, and do volunteer work. Feel free message me if you'd like to chat sometime!
YouShouldAim	I don't really know how to build relationships anymore | It's not fair to anybody around me and I hate it for both them and myself. I strongly feel that just being around people help to bring me out of my slumps at least for a few hours a week. My depression kinda went into it's biggest downward spiral after I was cheated on but it's always been here even before. Ever since then I just can't trust anyone. Even just casual friends, I'll send myself into a mental breakdown almost every night wondering what people weren't truthful to me about. Girls that had potential to build a good relationship with get pushed away because the moment I hear about them texting another guy or hanging out with a group of friends I'm instantly just rock bottom. Even though deep down I know it's nothing like that probably it just hurts me really deeply now.    At this point I don't know what to do anymore. I cried for the first time in a while just before typing this. I don't usually break like that I try to hold myself together for the sake of everyone else and to make myself feel more... sane than I am. I just don't want to continue living like this but every time I crack my shell and try to be around people again it's always the same. And I understand how ridiculous it is. I just want to be normal. I want to enjoy making relationships, I don't want to be jealous at every turn. I don't want to feel like everyone has the cruelest intentions for me and that I'm always the one left out.   I've never talked to anyone about it in real life to be honest. I called my mom earlier and I feel like she noticed something was wrong but wasn't concerned enough to pry into why I would just call to say hello. And I don't have it in me to say all this to her. I've disappointed them enough. I just can't help but feel I'll be this miserable my entire life.
YouShouldAim	I'm 299 and I still grind Heroic Events. The chance for Exotics is high enough and legendary engrams aren't uncommon. They are pretty good to do all the time.
YouShouldAim	it just feels really bad to have a subclass that revolves around melee'ing and only one tree has any kind of survivability. And it requires you to actually kill something with a melee before you can first start regenerating health. A situation which could end up completely negating said regen because you will be in close quarters and any damage will immediatly stop the regen.
YouShouldAim	Make the Way of the wind tree on Arcstrider begin health regeneration when you use dodge roll. | Replace the "harder to kill when dodging" point specifically with this. It would make dodge roll feel a lot more useful in both PvE and PvP and allow for some survivability with th hunters on the class. Right now I'm just feeling very much like Arcblade in D1. It's probably the most fun class but objectively the most useless as well.
YouShouldAim	So what should I do if I still don't have my ColdHeart? | I have done all the checks. I'm level 20, campaign well past finished. I'm light level 253, the pre-order bonus is in fact installed, I've restarted my Xbox and Game multiple times. I have none of my collector's edition bonuses. I'm very disappointed cause all my friends are talking about how great it is. Every time I go to the tower the gunsmith will glow as if he has something for me but he never does. My connection is very good as well.
YouShouldAim	Yeah I have done just about everything I possibly can. Zavala gave me an exotic engram but it gave me Orpheus Rig boots
YouShouldAim	uh NA's format? Everybody is happy with the way NA runs, it's competitive, viewership is high, and is all around a better format than Eu
YouShouldAim	I watch every EU stream and every NA stream. I'm well aware of viewer counts and how entertaining both are to watch. NA wins hands down, but I still watch EU because I like watching high level league of legends no matter the teams.
YouShouldAim	it's a slow grind from that point but you get to choose your next step. You can grind out R2 now for legendaries which are only slightly better than T6 Epics, or you can slow grind R3 and hope for a lucky leg drop from Normal or Hard mode.
YouShouldAim	I think your missing his point. the state of this sub is shit that we are allowing a picture of the President in here just to call him ugly. That's not PoliticalHumour. This is hardly even worthy of r/pics is this actually what we are trying to do now?
YouShouldAim	I really don't have a clue what your on about tbh. Your very upset that I choose to have differing opinions than yours when it's really not that big a deal. Your digging through my post history months in the past to prove some kind of point that I'm not even sure of.
YouShouldAim	I'm not pretending to be anything? I lurk more often than not and I rarely get into debates. just because I hold a view that favored Trump doesn't mean I can no longer hold an opinion on a post that serves only to criticize his looks? 
YouShouldAim	I mean, I kinda agree in a sense. Perkz is put in a lane dominant champion 90% of the time that may or may not scale into late game. But the "meme" is less so that they only draft late comps as it is that G2 doesn't really excel at winning before everyone is full build. I'd actually be very curious to see a stat of how many games G2 won before Zven started building his 6th item.
YouShouldAim	it's best to do Z1D4 for the schematic imo. cost less energy with a lot more encounters so the less item find% balances out. 
YouShouldAim	D4's are where I farm the majority of my schematics except for Zone 5 because I'm not quite strong enough to full auto it. But yes I got Quirk schem in D4 as well
YouShouldAim	it's the same amount of stats they can just be distributed differently. 
YouShouldAim	Yeah first physical reaction from me. That's like a terrible fear of mine played out right in front of me.
YouShouldAim	that's what gets me. literally EVERY item reward below 1 and 2 is essentially useless. there's a minute amount of people that could make use of the epic items, but those people are very likely not going to come anywhere close to the required rank. I mean I'm level 113, 1052 TS AND I have been sitting here at that TS for ages. Rewards from Trials/Gauntlet/PvP/GvG none of them will help me move cause i can hardly scratch out rank 1000-2000.   The only purpose the weekly rewards serve is to push the top 100ish people even further ahead
YouShouldAim	This is the kicker. It's uncanny that even 1 person had to go immediately after throwing a team fight, but 3 people? Give me a break.
YouShouldAim	I don't wanna fall for the bait guys but it's right here in front of me
YouShouldAim	Lmfao only 2. This guy counts /s
YouShouldAim	You did not watch the same game as everyone else my man.
YouShouldAim	Eh they are cool and all and definitely helpful but honestly it's just more pieces of gear with stats and negligible bonuses. I was kinda hoping that enchanted would be something you place on your gear that would give a weapon a new ability or something like that.
YouShouldAim	That would lower the need for gems so much that it would hurt the devs a lot. Pretty unrealistic
YouShouldAim	Has anybody had any luck with the Invasion game mode? | I've probably ran it somewhere close to 10-12 times now and only gotten 3 drops. I got the cosmetic staff, two rare schematics that don't look worth-while and 2 wet brainz this seems incredibly low and it's kinda discouraging to even bother with doing it. I keep seeing legendary schematics drop for other people but I don't even get a drop 50% of the time, let alone a legendary. I can only make it to wave 24 with 1050 TS. I don't really understand what I am supposed to be accomplishing with this event.
YouShouldAim	Your not gonna get Unity if you don't have the TS to farm it. Best upgrade it if you can.
YouShouldAim	Not OP but it would be cool for PvP stats, familiar usage stats, stats on how often people bribe epic/legendaries, I could go on and on, plenty of API opportunities. 
YouShouldAim	I ALSO HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR WARFFIN SCHEM FOR A WEEK. IT'S ALL THAT'S HOLDING ME BACK FROM WEMMBO
YouShouldAim	The only thing I find not balanced is the difference between Legendary pets and Epic-Uncommon pets. Playing against Gemmi in PvP when you don't have one feels like your loss was predetermined tbh.
YouShouldAim	And now as of their new management, they have become the most laughable team throwing money wherever they can to appear decent at best. Imagine if TL didn't buy Mickey in the last week of the LCS essentially. Do you think they would still be in the LCS right now? What about Dardoch? Dardoch doesn't look amazing but he sure as shit played better than Reignover on Liquid. Beating Challenger teams with no money and D class players doesn't mean they deserve to be in the LCS. If either of those challenger teams had support from Riot and even half the budget of Liquid, Liquid would be out and EUnited or GCU would be in their place and you know it. Don't play like it's not true.
YouShouldAim	So your telling me that TL sending Piglet, Mickey, Reignover, Dardoch, to relegation series represents a team that deserves to be in the LCS? Dardoch who started the season on CLG and helped them become top 3 for the majority of the season, Mickey, arguably one of the best mid laners in the world, Reignover considered for a while to be the best jungler in the West until... he joined Liquid. Piglet, world class ADC seems middle of the pack NA on team Liquid. What do you think another organization could pull off with those players? We saw FNC and IMT with Reignover, completely dominant and hit the shitter when they lost him. Mickey was the only guy to have a better damage rating then Faker himself. He couldn't carry Liquid past the only game they needed to stay away from relegations. You seriously think that Team Liquid beating challenger teams that have no budget and D-Tier players somehow means they are more LCS ready as an organization? That's laughable man
YouShouldAim	This is really well done. This should get sticked or put into that resources for new players sticky
YouShouldAim	I mean, if any other team even had 75% of the money TL has they would LIKELY be better off than TL. The management is horrendous and doesn't deserve to be rewarded for the sake of just buying emergency world-class players to bail them out of relegations.
YouShouldAim	TL is only good because they have a seemingly endless money supply to purchase any player to bail them out of a failing season. Literally any organization in the game right now would probably have a better coaching staff and environment than TL. No other team in the world fails this badly with the caliber of players TL has.
YouShouldAim	MVP isnt supposed to be a strategy game. The intention is to give the actual MVP the award, not manipulate votes to get your teammate the best chance at it. 
YouShouldAim	I always love to see people that truly just know the limits of their champion. Nice vid guy.
YouShouldAim	Well clearly what the did wasnt working. FNC just slam their forehead against the same strat over and over hoping it will work. 
YouShouldAim	Obviously its everyone's number 1 goal to actually win. But everybody also wants to realistically leave with a convincingly good performance and show that they are good outside their conference.
YouShouldAim	So does new familiars confirm new Zone/Raid? I just got to R3 :/
YouShouldAim	Thats what everyone is missing. Everyone's stuck on Zhonyas but this builds into GA as well. So far from the choices we have seen if I was an AD I would give up going into debt to buy items to know that Zed will have to roam more than once to eventually kill me, and that is if he hasnt already fallen too far behind in trying to do so.    ADC's can take this rune, mid lane Mages and other mid laners can take this (Corki, Jayce, Varus, etc.) Elise Khazix Vi can take this in the jungle, top laners like Renekton can take it. Its viable on almost anyone that Zed could target aside from supports because it builds into both Zhonyas and Guardian Angel.  I get a lot of people dont like to play against the likes of assassins like Zed, but your kidding yourself if you dont think this will affect him largely. His winrate  is already sub-50%, handing out a free zhonyas is gonna hit it hard.
YouShouldAim	So basically every head to head they have had you are going to dismiss conveniently as joke tourneys? Oddly convenient for you considering Rekkles is on the losing end of all of them huh?
YouShouldAim	Im saying a lot if you cant tell. Your boasti g Rekkles as the best AD in the west while claiming international success from years ago as your proof. Where really their only international competition recent enough to count for anything resulted in utter failure for Rekkles. RR was a tournament for fun, but teams still showed up to win and he lost.
YouShouldAim	This is exactly my concern. If enemy mid laners recieve it for free at 6 minutes that negates any need to bring exhaust or hurt themselves by rushing a zhonyas. Especially with runes being editable in champ select it seems like a big get out of jail free pass if the enemy team is dumb enough to lock in an assassin. If they extend the time to get it.. sure. But as is Zed, as well as a few other, will be shoved out of the meta super hard.
YouShouldAim	Ok then where was Rekkles at RR? Why did he get curb stomped by DL there?
YouShouldAim	I literally used more than just 1v1 as an example. And if you watched FNC's video at Rift Rivals you would know that their gameplan was to win. They werent just testing the waters with the same Kennen they have been playing all season lol. Rekkles is not better than DL plain and simple
YouShouldAim	Except everytime Rekkles and DL have met DL has won pretty convincingly. Whether it be a regular 5v5 match or in the 1v1 tournament Rekkles gets dicked everytime. I mean literally right now Rekkles is considered the best ADC in EU, and they gave him every pick he wanted at RR and he got shit stomped so hard it wasnt even funny. Rekkles accomplishments are team based, DL shows up against the man himself every chance he gets.
YouShouldAim	Also you meed to dip into speed as well. Its a tad bit low but not terrible.
YouShouldAim	You shouldnt even be trying Z5 if your at 650 TS. Farm for familiars for Bobodom and Wemmbo things like that, while you wait for some better gear to bring you up to at least 700. Your just wasting energy on Z5 trying to force your way through lile that
YouShouldAim	What are your specific stats? I finished Z5 with 700 TS with Squibbo and Shrampz with only 3 Shrampz in the stable. You should be well beyond the needed stats for success in Z5. Also are you holding your potions or what? 
YouShouldAim	Never use gems to refresh energy, you will need those to buy pet eggs and accessories, as well as bribing epic familiars. The game is intended to be played a few different times through out the day. Specifically when you unlock raids there will be plenty of different things for you to do outside of quests that use their own form of energy. 
YouShouldAim	Still R1 Heroic. I was skeptical at first too when I unlocked R2, but fully upgraded tier 5 Epics arent as good as fully upgraded tier 5 legs, and you likely cant do R2 Heroic so you would just be wasting raid shards.
YouShouldAim	I farmed D1 for ages trying to get it but switched to D4 and got it after a couple days. Minor experience but I would agree that D4 is best, more enemies negates the lesser bomus item find
YouShouldAim	Thats quite hefty. I domt think its a terrbile thing to sell friend spots if he follows through with the agreement considering those top players probably spent a lot more than those prices. I would never spend money on such a thing but I dont think its unreasonable for him to sell friend spots tbh
YouShouldAim	Is Groger a valid replacement for Bor'lan? | Im getting close to 200 Heroic runs on R1 trying to get Squib with no luck. I dont even have the schematic for Squibbo either. I do have a Grimz and a schematic for Groger. It wouldnt be to hard to get a Kroger, is it worth my time to replace Bor'lan with him?
YouShouldAim	I cant even manual R2 Hard. How do you manage to get friends like this
YouShouldAim	That would leave match of the weeks either on Monday/Tuesday which is bad for match of the weeks, or on the first days of the broadcast window, which would kill off incentice to watch the following games. They wouldnt start it on the weekend and end it on monday/tuesday
YouShouldAim	If Hauntzer never invades level 1 again I could die happy
YouShouldAim	I definitley noticed it this weekend as I spammed more games than usual. Two waves of caster minions now will cause me to miss more melee creeps than ever. Watching my champion walk back and forth behind them trying to get to the minion I targeted is infuriating because im not missing minions due to lack of timing or skill, but because at that moment in time my champion decided to forget how to shuffle past minions.
YouShouldAim	This was a situation that happened pretty much every game, I play almost strictly melee champions so im no stranger walking through and around minion waves all gane long every game. Its definitely worse than usual and is not just circumstancial. Your blind if you think it hasnt gotten worse
YouShouldAim	Yeah thats the infuriating thing. He is supposed to have weak early laning but come level 2 he can win most all-ins if he plays it right with Q and W. It only gets worse as the game goes on, seeing an empowered W take away 60% of your HP just isnt fun. Caitlyn crit headshots dont even do that anymore.
YouShouldAim	37
YouShouldAim	Where do I get dubloons?
YouShouldAim	Because it is personal experience and that is all we have to offer. My personal experience with Ragnar is that he isnt worth a bribe
YouShouldAim	How come R2 seems less used than R1 and R3? | All the time I see the popups for people getting R1 legs and R3 legs and in the social area people are all over wearing R1 and R3 stuff but I rarely see R2 gear. Why is this?
YouShouldAim	Ragnar is my most frequent offer by far, been offered 4 times, have 4 Ragnars. I didnt bribe a single one. Ragnar himself isnt good enough to bribe until you have the schem and are ready to fuse once you have him. So until then I wouldnt bribe
YouShouldAim	Why should the military take in someone transitioning and on hormones when people with ADHD or people who had asthma in middle school arent allowed in? Your not some special case because your issue is a considered a "social issue". The military doesnt work that way for anyone, not just trans.
YouShouldAim	The comment I replied to was to someone talking about being on hormones. Get the fuck out of the conversation if your not going to read all the context. So sick of everyone throwing "goal-post shifting" at people for addressing the specifics they like to throw around.
YouShouldAim	I dont know where you get your info but the current standing with asthma in particular is that the only way you can get by the rule is if your medical history does not show any asthma symptoms since the age of 13. Otherwise you are entirely exempt from joining the military, doesnt matter the role. Every person in the military is at least mildly combat trained. Its been that way for a long time. Your info is wrong
YouShouldAim	So what your saying is that the OP that I replied to is allowed to suggest a specific, and you are the goal-post policeman that wont allow me to respond to said specific? Your a piece of work.
YouShouldAim	I never though I would truly see something THIS sensitive. Thats not an insult, its fact. The surgery IS elective and for the most part IS cosmetic. 
YouShouldAim	So im fear mongering now? Lol ill wait for you to reply to the other person than, since everyone in this thread has an agenda. Everyone has their point of view, expressing it is inherently pushing an agenda now I guess
YouShouldAim	The elective part is 100% fact. There is nobody out there that NEEDS their gender reassigned. There will never be a case where a doctor walks into the room and says we need to have an emergency surgery to save your life and it involves changing your sex. It is 100% ENTIRELY elective. Obviously it being cosmetic is up for debate. But I would love to hear how I am wrong.
YouShouldAim	A few states do not mean all states. In most cases by a long shot medicaid will NOT pay for such services and is also still classified as cosmetic. I would dare say if you look at the states the make up the larger proportions of the military will take that stance.
YouShouldAim	Im aware of the definition of necessary. But what your trying to imply has one of two issues and there is no way around it. You are either saying A: said Trans person has a mental condition that renders them so incapable that surgery is necessary to remedy it, or B: that Trans people can choose to have this surgery to address their condition but its not necessary. It has to be on or the other and either way you lose your point. If they are so MENTALLY damaged that PHYSICAL surgery is necessary, they are not fit for the military by a long shot in comparison to many of their other standards to be enlisted. And if the surgery is not necessary, then there is no reason for the military to supply it which is also a major source for this entire discussion to be taking place. Am I wrong?
YouShouldAim	"Nah, I'm saying that when I see someone who appears to be pushing an agenda by taking on certain details, I am going to call that out. I am not policing you, and I am not preventing you from responding to anybody. Please keep your desperate fear-mongering out of this... and you talk about me being a piace of work."    That is what you said. You said I was pushing an agenda by saying what I said. To which I sarcastically replied that "everyone is pushing an agenda apparently" because I voiced an opinion that you took as agenda pushing. Do you understand how ironic this is yet or no? You are accomplishing nothing dont fool yourself. I mean we can play your game of judging things at face value and look at the upvotes. More people are agreeing with me than you, you are dissuading nobody from taking my stance on things, you are succeeding in looking like an idiot that doesnt know what he is talking about. Move on.
YouShouldAim	You really dont have any actual point here do you? This all began with you having some kind of problem with me addressing someone else's comment, my response being entirely on topic with the other person's comment. Claiming I shifted the goal posts off of some preconcieved conclusion you got from some of my other comments apparently. My comment I posted about someone being sensitive was with the context that somebody took the statement from some else "the surgery is elective amd cosmetic" as a terrible insult. You would have understood that had you actually took the time to read the context there as well.   There was no goal post shifting here, not even close. You have some notion that anybody who challenges an opinion here will do whatever is necessary to win said argument, in this case you have accused me of goal post shifting, desperately fear mongering, etc. (For bonus points I would love for you to explain how I have incited fear in any way). So really the only thing you have accomplished here was talking out of your ass about something you didnt bother to actually look into, which shows plain as day being that you have no clue what any of my comments are actually referring to, you just look at them at face value and make a judgement.
YouShouldAim	So lets go back to the start then. A person commented about not paying for surgerys because he/she was just on hormones. I pointed out why hormones still caused an issue for the military, then you chimed in about me goal post shifting.    Now, point out what details I left out? Or am i still misrepresenting what you did?
YouShouldAim	Theres not exactly a very wide variety of scenarios in this game. Doesnt really take too long for a meta to form, Blaziken pretty easily settled into the meta. Remember Virizion release? He was in every deck within a few days and it stayed that way. In comparison to like Swampert, he was played a lot for a few days and then essentially dissapeared because he sucks. 
YouShouldAim	Standard or not its used? Give me some standard examples and then we can see some side effects then.
YouShouldAim	http://www.rxlist.com/prometrium-side-effects-drug-center.htm  Thats just one. I really dont feel like filling my web history with hormone searches for trans people but I would dare say all of them look similar to this one.
YouShouldAim	Do youactually want me to list out every side effect that taking hormones can cause, and are not very uncommon either? A lot of these are pretty serious, id say with confidence more serious than someone getting slightly disctracted from having ADHD. Who are you actually trying to kid saying that taking hormones is somehow less detrimental than having ADHD or some of the other small things that will keep you out of the military. Stop taking everyone for idiots man.
YouShouldAim	Do I have a healing rift on any of my Hunter skill trees?
YouShouldAim	That PC is miles ahead of anything I have ever touched. Im still on a GTX 760 and now I feel prehistoric
YouShouldAim	I cant seem to reproduce it the way you describe but I do remember this happening to me one single time. Not 100% sure what causes it.
YouShouldAim	Which fams are "must-bribe" if you get the chance with enough gems available? | Like is Astaroth good enough for people who are still stuck in R1 Z4 to bribe? Or Squib? Grimz? Lord C? Which fams should I look out for and bribe if given the chance?
YouShouldAim	Surprisingly enough both were within the first 20 runs. So i guess I should count my blessings cause apparently I am more lucky than most
YouShouldAim	"I think it’s better. Martin is more part of the team now. He’s still a bit for himself, but he’s slowly becoming more and more a part of the team again. I don’t know if that’s just from him having his break or from him playing more for the team, but overall, things are getting better, and he’s becoming more a part of the team"    Based of this I guess Rekkles was seperated from the team because he just wanted a break? Which is odd that the team wouldnt try out a sub or something in that case if Rekkles wanted to seperate from the team in every scenario outside of playing on stage it seems. Glad he is at least trying to be a part of the team again.
YouShouldAim	If I may ask then, how did you get through Zone 4? I was told I needed Squib to get past flag 8 cause my Bro'lan just gets melted
YouShouldAim	The team has admitted several times over the past week that their entire playstyle was adapted to play around Rekkles. Soaz getting pissed on twitter because he had to play champions he saw as garbage, Caps getting little to no resources after laning phase to help compensate for Rekkles late game. I think its safe to say FNC was all in on Rekkles carrying
YouShouldAim	So I have completed R1 101 times | And I only have two Legs, and the only familiar I have even had the chance to persuade is Ragnar. I have the gems saved up to bribe Squib when I finally do get that opportunity but after 101 succesful runs (99 of them have been on Heroic) it doesnt seem normal at all. Thankfully I  have at least gotten two Ragnars by just persuasion but honestly he doesnt do me much good. Am I on the bottom end of the RNG spectrum or is this completely normal?
YouShouldAim	Im not suggesting let go of him, but maybe try out some new talent for the academy team, while Rekkles trys to figure out his situation.
YouShouldAim	What Familiars should I be using in Z4? | I have the typical Bro'lan and Shrampz, but that cant get me by Z4F8. Bro'lan gets shredded to fast and Shrampz just acts like a meat shield as long as he can. I have tried subbing in Ragnar, Tubbo, Lord C, Pengz, I cant really figure out a good combo. Pengz and Shrampz got me thr closest but I didnt get the boss down to even 50% HP. Im level 64, with 215/107/140 with two R1 Legs and the rest is epic, all upgraded quite a bit.
YouShouldAim	Their number one song on Spotify is I Hold Dominion. This band is too Rito for Rito
YouShouldAim	Everything Riot has is on Spotify so I would imagine its all free
YouShouldAim	Yeah Im curious as well if its worth the investment
YouShouldAim	For the people who don't understand why the Hunter is underwhelming | We get it, nobody is doing it "right" with dodging near enemies to recharge your melee and go on combo sprees meleeing low level adds and recharging over and over. But what people arent thinking about is that the technique is purely flash and not practical at all. It can only be used on low health adds when no strong melee adds are present (Gladiator Cabal anyone?). If you do find a situation that caters to that pre-req, why wouldnt it be simple to just shoot the low level adds? If the enemy can be one shot by your melee and allows you to do this combo, you can just as easily kill the add in two bursts with a pulse rifle or less. There is no reason to put yourself in range of said enemies where they can actually do damage to you just to try a unreasonably high effor combo for style points.    An AOE Invisibility smoke bomb would make more sense for a class ability. Gives team utility, and keeps the hunter identity intact, all while keeping to a reasonable cooldown.
YouShouldAim	See this is what people are missing. Hunters right now in D2 are flashy and have combos, but nothing about the way they work are practical in actual end game activities, or anything that isnt lower level adds in general. Even just the drill part of the strike with all the dog adds, I quickly get overwhelmed if I try and chain my melees, even repeatedly dodging out and then meleeing back in doesnt help. Its just not practucal in an actual situation, where just shotting the enemies with your primary wouldnt be a more reasonable solution.
YouShouldAim	His clear time isnt the issue, but if he is going to be one of the most powerful ganker with hard CC on 3 abilities, he has to have a clear weakness, and that will be his clear time
YouShouldAim	And thats when weapon mods come into play 
YouShouldAim	You do realize your getting dupes because the weapon pool is limited to those weapons only right?
thsmths	I have depression since my childhood and have lost my teenage to it makes me even more depressed | There's nothing I envy more than those people who had normal childhood and teenage. I don't know what is like to be a teenager and to get out with friends without feeling bad about myself and having this constant anxiety. It's not fair to say that I didn't have good moments but I don't know, I wish I had much more.  I'm a 23 y/o man, unemployed, without college and without much hope to have something substantial in my life besides my wife and my family, people who I really love.
lonelyanddepressedaf	forming dependencies | I feel like its all i do.  Every new person i meet, i obsess over them.  A majority of my time is spent thinking about them.  I am a wreck without them.  It happens every time and I never learn that nobody really likes me, nobody really cares, and nobody should feel like they care about me.  But i still grasp onto false hopes like they will actually help me when really they just drag me further down.  I just wish at some point I would learn from my mistakes.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Less frustrating to me, it's just weird talking to people and thinking about how they don't want to die, they aren't miserable.  It's just something that if I were under their circumstances, I would be a wreck, but to them, all is good.
lonelyanddepressedaf	i fail at everything and hurt others in the process | latest example: just tried to post a poster from my school to r/bonehurtingjuice on my main and ended up accidentally leaking the google classroom code for my school's drama club.  and now apparently some asshole is raiding it now and is probably leaking my main reddit to my school.  why the fuck do i have to fuck shit up like this.  i never wanted to hurt anyone but i just fucking trashed this clubs google classroom.  the worst part is im too pussy to admit its me to them.  all because of my negligence these people have to suffer.  im literally just a detriment.
lonelyanddepressedaf	same here, i pussied out of my first plan, and im just riding things out now
lonelyanddepressedaf	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
lonelyanddepressedaf	Well, the first girl i had talked to cut me off after a magical summer.  We had a ton of fun together, it was pretty platonic, and we were really good together.  After about two months, she cut me off and wouldnt even respond to my texts.  I have no idea why to this day.  I was a wreck until about a month into school.  Second girl.  Talked to my best friend, they decided they didnt want a relationship, they split.  She comes to me, leads me on and we schedule date and all that.  One week later i get a text from her: 'im not ready for a relationship sorry bye'.  She and my best friend have been dating for almost a year now.  Theres more to this story but ill leave it out because its unimportant.  Third girl.  Girl i graduated middle school with.  She hit me up.  We talked and scheduled a date.  I get a text from her:'sorry i cant bye'.  Havent heard a word since.  Fourth girl.  Talked to for 6 months. We knew everything about each other.  She used me as a vent and a shoulder to cry on.  I wasnt really even looking for a relationship with her but she led me on to the point where i was interested, only to be let down.  The fifth one is petty so ill leave it out but thats my story.  I dont really blame them except for girl two and three but i wish that they hadnt led me on.  Its really fucked up when you act like youre into someone but really you just want to use them for yourself.  This is going to happen again at some point and ill never learn my lesson.  Nobody actually cares about me, they just want something from me.  As for my friend, yeah i see that.  Its just how she nonchalantly brushes people off, where i would eat that kind of attention up.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I feel like nobody else knows | Everybody im surrounded by has someone in their life they call theirs.  If they dont theyre on there way to.  But here i am all fucking alone, doomed.  I feel unlovable.  Ive talked to five different girls in the past year.  All of them have either cut me off or manipulated me.  It really gets to me.  Then the one girl i have as a friend is hit up almost daily by guys at random but she also complains that she has nobody.  If i had that treatment i would for sure take advantage of it.  I just wish i could hold someone and know things will turn out okay.  But its pointless because ill always just be alone.  Theres no point in living.  I swear im one bad turn to blowing my head off.  School is going to be the fucking worst.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Lied on the doctor questionnaire | So im old enough where they give me a different questionnaire at the doctors'.  Going through everything was the same until i saw something along the lines of 'have you ever seriously considered suicide'.  I checked no, knowing full well it was a complete lie.  I just didnt want to jump through the hoops of getting meds or help.  I go to therapy, but it doesnt help at all.  What about the rest of you, this was something small, but i just wanted to share it.  Thanks.
lonelyanddepressedaf	she must have someone new now. | everythings okay. Its okay.  I get it.  You found someone better than me to talk to.  We made an agreement to stick with each other if either of us managed to get in a relationship, but, eh, who cares?  Promises shpromises right?  I dont mind being lonely and suicidal all by myself every night now anyways.  Oh yeah, and when i tell you im in physical pain because of who alone i am, 'lol' is an appropriate response.  Its okay.  Its okay.  Everythings fine.  Its alright that we spilled our hearts out to each other and there is literally NOTHING i havent told you, even though you cant say the same.  Just leave me.  Ill be fine.  Ignoring me when im at my worst is normal.  Support shmupport right?  I should neck myself.  Nobody to talk to anymore.  Nobody cares as long as they feel fine.  This person is the reason im not dead right now and she knows it, and obviously she doesnt care.  Whatever.  Just another person on the list of people who go behind my back.im down to 1.  1 person who has not done wrong by me.  If it hits 0 im checking out.    Sorry for the shitpost rant.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I love you too.  Good night.  hopefully one day we will have someone.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I didnt realize it until now, but i havent played a game in weeks.  I love games.  All ive been doing is browsing reddit, 4chan, and youtube.
lonelyanddepressedaf	How am i supposed to be at school like this? | My depression has gotten worse and worse in the past year, and it spiked this summer.  Im constantly either stressed or depressed, even when i have no responsibilities.  How in the fuck am i supposed to completely junior year with remotely passing marks like this?  Last year was my worst year for grades, with me barely passing many classes, and now i have to do it with even worse depression?  How do people do this?  I know another person at my school that has depression and they manage to get perfect marks.  I really think that ending it will be a good solution because if i fuck up high school itll follow me for the rest of my life.  Does anyone have any advice?  Thanks
lonelyanddepressedaf	Im relying on one person to be mentally stable and its going to come crashing down | This is not the first time ive done this, attaching myself emotionally to someone to the point where they are a necessity.  Me and this person have been talking every night for half a year and ive built a dependence.  Theres a power outage in her part of town because of a storm rn and im breaking down because i have nobody to be there.  Im all alone, just like before.  When she pokes fun at me or fucks off and watches youtube/netflix while we're in a call i get more depressed than usual.  This is a problem that i cannot stop.  When she inevitably stops talking to me when she gets a boyfriend or someone, ill be back to my neutral, ultra-depressed state.  I just wish that I didnt attach myself to people like i do, but i cant help it.  Fuck
lonelyanddepressedaf	Right now im wasting my time being a shit student with a shit social life.  I wish i could experience all the shit most people do.
lonelyanddepressedaf	around last december somebody told me that they had attempted suicide and were suicidal.  I instantly went into the 'please dont do it' and people care about you' mode where you just spew nice things at them because i thought that suicidal thoughts were for insane people or something.  now its hard to imagine not having them.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	I had this problem for a while and about a week ago I actually got myself to cry when I was roughing out a suicide note for the only friend I have who has stayed at my side 100% and has never let me down in any way.  Hes one of the few reasons im still here.
lonelyanddepressedaf	long story.  Girl who used me to get with my best friend and has been slowly and painfully pulling him away from me for a year now.
lonelyanddepressedaf	That awkward moment when a big reason youre going to therapist sits across from you at the therapists office | lol
lonelyanddepressedaf	Last year, I was riding my bike.  My front wheel got struck by a car and I was sent flying into the air and I landed 10 feet from where i was hit.  My bike suffered no damages, I suffered road rash and no broken bones, and the only thing actually damaged was the car that hit me.  The bumper got dented pretty bad.  It was surreal.  I really couldn't believe what happened. I decided right then that i would have to live every day like it was my last because my life could end at any time.  That was what started my summer.  That summer was the best immediate gratification I've ever had in my entire life.  I'm suffering the consequences now with a downward spiral of depression.  be careful with what you do, man.  I know that feel, and I know what can become of it.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	im unfortunately a member of this big shitty club
lonelyanddepressedaf	I talk to someone quite frequently and it always seems that when I'm depressed their personal responsibility is to remind me of what I will never have.  They don't do it on purpose, it's just how casually they compliment themselves, like theyre oblivious to how i feel about myself.  it fucking sucks
lonelyanddepressedaf	thats good, enjoy those sweet, sweet frames.
lonelyanddepressedaf	possibly your monitor?  Use OBS or something to record a clip of the stuttering.  If the stuttering shows up in the recording the exact same way it happened in realtime, it's your monitor.  thinking more clearly for a second, itd probably be easier to just run fraps and see if the stutters are shown in the frame counter.  thinking now, 3dmark's scores are partially based on amount of frames created, so for you to get a fine score makes me think its probably not your pc, its your monitor or a shit video cable
lonelyanddepressedaf	What are your specs?  I could probably help you out a bit.  One big thing is Xbox's Game DVR that runs by default.  Go to Settings>Gaming>Game DVR>Switch off 'Record in the background while I'm playing a game".  Another thing is that your gpu could not be properly installed and you could actually be using your cpu's integrated graphics.  Make sure your gpu is actually all the way installed into your motherboard.  Get 3DMark 11 and run a benchmark: http://www.futuremark.com/downloads/3dmark11.zip  Compare your results to other people online via 3dmark's scoring system.  Good luck to you, man.  PS: download latest drivers for your gpu  edit: grammar n shit
lonelyanddepressedaf	im in a similar situation.  16, 2 friends that I can actually talk to about real shit, and at school there are like 2 more that I dont talk to about anything real, its all just school bullshit.  Everyone else just seems to fuck off to their own groups.  i only work out when im feeling okay.  i just dont have the motivation otherwise.  this summer i get the joy of working for 9 hours in the sun, coming home for about 1 hour, and waking up at 6.  on repeat.  weekends are when i catch a break and stay home by myself and get those real lonely depressed feels.  i wish i could say it gets better, but in my case it just gets worse and worse and worse.  i go to therapy, but thats just because I broke down real bad in front of my parents and I now im stuck going even though it doesnt help.  ive heard it helps for some people, though.  it sounds like you're willing to help yourself, give it a try, before it gets worse.  get out of this slump if you can, you don't want to be like this for the rest of your life.  trust me.  good luck.  edit: read some of the other comments and some dude said go outside or something.  do that.  some of my best memories are bike riding through the park.  it is therapeutic.  go for a walk, ride a bike, whatever.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	I can't wait until my keyboard gets delivered and I can finally start making music 9999999999% more efficiently.  Also great fucking song
lonelyanddepressedaf	People don't give me advice, I usually just get friendzoned after a very painful amount of time where I completely emotionally attach myself to the other person.  I feel like I'll never learn.  You do have shit going for you man, a lot more than I do.  It's a matter of time for you imo.  Have hope.
lonelyanddepressedaf	she has anxiety and OCD, I have depression and anxiety.  its pretty rough.
lonelyanddepressedaf	hey man, vent to me.  Im going through a similar situation.  Ive been talking to a girl that I think I would be perfect with since January, and I basically pussied out a month ago and instead of acting on my feelings, I told her that we should stay friends.  Eventually shes going to get a boyfriend and stop talking to me.  Its going to hurt a lot.  Just bracing myself at this point.  What's your situation?
lonelyanddepressedaf	Its the small jeers that hurt the most.  When someone talks about your insecurities like they're nothing just because they don't have the same insecurities or problems, it is one of the most draining and depressing feelings in the world.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Basically, i had brought up the concept of a relationship in the past, but she was iffy, and pretty much just told me to wait on it.  When we started talking, she was almost undeniably interested, but i was uninterested.  The more we talked, she became less interested in a relationship, while I became more interested.  I pretty much just gave up before I could start and told her that we should stay friends because i can deal with not being in a relationship, but not not having her as a friend ( i need her as a friend and losing her would mean that i have nobody to actually vent to).  I just wish i didnt scare her away with how self loathing and depressed i am.  We wouldve been perfect.  I guess ill just stay the lonely, loveless piece of shit ive always been.
lonelyanddepressedaf	i exercised today | This is usually a sign that im exiting a slump.  Ive been feeling pretty shit for the past weeks, but today I actually had the motivation to exercise.  I think my mood can depend greatly on how much I'm thinking about the current state of being I'm in.  I hope everyone else here can get a raise in mood like I did,  even if it's not for a very long time.  :)
lonelyanddepressedaf	I had a big problem with this last year, and now its kind of flipped on me.  Last year, I would have to remind myself to drink water because I would get really bad headaches all the time because I never got thirsty. Now it seems like I barely have any self control when it comes to food.
lonelyanddepressedaf	i feel like one day i might because nobody else actually wants to talk about my problems.  i know they dont care either but at least someone is listening 
lonelyanddepressedaf	:(
lonelyanddepressedaf	yep.  me too. ive already vented all over this sub and a few others so much that theres nothing left to say. all thats left is my impending suicide
lonelyanddepressedaf	i got lucky.  my parents had boughts of depression and it took only a little bit of pushing for them to get that something was wrong.  at first they didnt believe me but after about 10 minutes of complete chaos and shouting they figured out i wasnt kidding that i wanted to kill myself.  only thing thats different now is i go to therapy, but i feel like everytime i go my therapist is just trying to check boxes off a checklist.  life is a joke.
lonelyanddepressedaf	my only coping method is an unhealthy amount of time in front of a screen and masturbation.
lonelyanddepressedaf	thats whats keeping me from doing it.  i have nothing to live for of substance.  no foreseeable future.  nothing.  just the fact that i would make others feel bad.  why should we have to suffer just so others dont have to deal with the loss of us?
lonelyanddepressedaf	ive been in a similar situation.  it really fucking hurts man.  it hurts bad.  my best friend and this bitch have been together for almost a year now.  i feel like i lost my best friend and he doesnt care.  death is optimal.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I wonder maybe that if you can change the date of the party, some people would be able to show up?  Sure, your kid may be a little dissapointed that they have to wait longer for their party, but at least some people would be able to go.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Preparing | last night i decided that it might be a good idea to work on the letters I would write to people so that if i decide its time to go i dont have any time to waste.  i really feel like my suicidal thoughts are going to turn to actions soon.  nothing to live for, depression, loneliness, blah blah blah.  im pretty sure school is going to be the end of me.  the stress from last year was insane and everyone is saying that next year is the most important and if you fuck up youre screwed for life.  i really dont feel like i can deal with attempting to have a stable social life while balancing school performance.  everything used to be so simple.
lonelyanddepressedaf	It's pretty difficult for me to get tears out nowadays, so usually I just fetal position on the floor, close my eyes, and self-loathe.
lonelyanddepressedaf	For your first paragraph, idk, not familiar with the science of it.  I can give you my personal experience with depression, however.  Also input on what you're feeling.  My battle w/ depression started around a year ago.  It was mixed with some anxiety ( i dont have anxiety disorder i was just extremely anxious all the time for a time period).  And it was real bad.  I had never felt actual depression before that.  I was constantly depressed the whole summer, and there was a few reasons, but I'm not going to get into that because it's a long story.  As the situations cooled down, I could focus better at school, and my mental health was starting to look on the up side.  I still had my moments, though.  Then, the whole year I started to become distracted.  I had grown depressed for no real reason.  I would be lost in weeks of suicidal thoughts and little motivation.  At some points I thought that some how I was forcing the depression onto myself, that I was just faking it.  During an episode, I decided that enough was enough, I was forcing this on myself and I wouldn't let it go on anymore.  So I tried to be happy, to cheer up.  I tried hard.  When that didn't work, I knew something was wrong.  Since then I've had some upper moments and lowers, but it's mostly been a downward spiral.  So yeah, imho, id say that events can cause long lasting mental illness.  As for your situation, hopefully it ends soon.  You've only been on this ride for a week, and you should try your best to surround yourself with positive things so that this does not become an issue later down the line.  Good luck.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I know that feel.  Even on your best days you just have that irk in the back of your mind tugging on you, reminding you you're hopelessly suicidal and lonely.  The only time thsi isnt true is when im having fun while drunk.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I Finally Cried Today, After So Long | Finally, I cried today.  I haven't cried in months.  I've been a depressed sulking slob, and I could not cry.  Try as I might, as soon as I got close to tears, I would get excited thinking about that relief you get after crying and jinx it.  But today, it happened.  I cried.  I bawled.  And it felt so good.  Letting it all out, cold tears running down my cheeks.  What made me cry was that today I decided I should start roughing suicide notes off the top of my head, and when I started, I started tearing up.  When I go to my only loyal, true friend left, I said what I wanted about him, and when I started talking about all the fun we had, my body couldn't stop me anymore.  Tears left my eyes and I was crying.  I couldn't see with all the tears, and nothing felt so good/bad as that in a long time.  If you are stuck being unable to cry best of luck to you, I hope you get to experience a good cry one of these days.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Pretty much the same, with added misery and suicidal thoughts when not w/ friends.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I know what you mean.  Today I got so close.  My eyes were ready to burst with tears, and then I got excited that I would finally be able to just let it all out, and I ruined it.  I just want to cry so fucking bad.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Definitely.  Just knowing that everyone else is out doing stuff theyve been invited to having fun.  It hurts physically and mentally how alone I am.  Nobody ever invites me to anything.  Ever.
lonelyanddepressedaf	The only time i dont feel this is when im happy drunk
lonelyanddepressedaf	What I project out to everyone tends to be a happy vibe but I am so dead inside.  So drained.  Living is tiring.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Im realizing now that what i have now will be a lifelong issue.  There is very little chance ill ever get over my depression and loneliness.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I feel ya, im actually going to see him tomorrow.  Hes the only person that I can fully trust.  He is loyal as fuck.  And btw, its not pathetic,  i feel the same way.  We're just touch-starved.
lonelyanddepressedaf	We need something like a dating site.. for hugs
lonelyanddepressedaf	Either or would be the best high in the world
lonelyanddepressedaf	Why Shouldn't I Kill Myself? | [removed]
lonelyanddepressedaf	Same situation here.  I have a bridge in my area but I don't know if it's high school enough to be fatal if jumped from.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I feel you.  I have no long term goals, hardly any short-term goals, and just plain existing is stressful.  I have nobody to call mine, and very few actual friends.  My depression has gotten worse and worse, especially throughout the last few weeks.  During the day it's bearable, but at night it gets real bad.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	i just want to fall asleep with someone in my arms | just knowing someone trusts me and loves me would be a dream come true.  i just wish i could have affection like everyone else seems to have.  i swear im the only person in my school who's foreign to any kind of love outside of family.  everyone else is happy and in love while i sit alone in my room wishing my pillow was a person and that I could hug a living person.  i want to know i can put my trust in someone.  everyone ive trusted except for one person has turned on me in one way or another.  why are people like this, what do people have to gain from wrecking other peoples mental stability?  what the fuck?  whatever, ive learned from the past that people are going to fuck you over no matter how close you think you are to them.  i dont know how much longer i can stand being this lonely.  its a so close but yet so far away feeling, all the time.  every day bridge jumping becomes more and more of an acceptable option.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I get you.  I know that exact feeling, you kind of feel at peace.  The only thing for me is that after I'm done fantasizing, reality kicks in.  I'm still alone as I ever was, I probably will always be alone, and there's not much I can do about it.
lonelyanddepressedaf	its good to know that you feel after typing that.  it is good to just say everything you feel, its why i made this separate account.  it is good to know that im not 'alone' in my struggles with loneliness.
lonelyanddepressedaf	RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers
lonelyanddepressedaf	i too wish i had someone that i could talk too honestly and hug it out, cry it out, whatever.  the loneliness fucking hurts bad.  it sucks bad that not many people came to say goodbye to you man, but on the bright side you're bound to meet new people in Chile.  its going to be bad for a while, but when you start meeting new people itll start feeling like home.  good luck to the both of us that we'll meet some people before we decide it's time to leave.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	fuck everything | fuck living fuck love fuck feelings fuck sadness fuck happiness fuck 'friends' fuck everything  Fuck it.
lonelyanddepressedaf	yep.  Its like you go in trying to shout into a void and you actually get responses
lonelyanddepressedaf	my body used to do this thing where i would be severely depressed for a couple days and then I would be numb emotionally for like two or three weeks, on repeat.  Fucking sucks.
lonelyanddepressedaf	yeah, everythings always same old same old
lonelyanddepressedaf	realizing how much of a doormat i am | been used by 4 people in the past year or so.  all of them benefited to my detriment.  i swear my trust issues are only going to become worse and worse if this pattern continues.  why do people feel the need to exploit me?  is it because i get emotionally attached too quickly?  is it because you think im too stupid to realize what youre trying to do?  do you like to see my suffer?  am i silly for trusting people that 'open up' to me about real shit and then go stab me in the back?  what the fuck?  i just wish people would be honest with each other.  if i think someones trying to be real with me, i return the favor.  i guess some people just dont think that way.  doesnt matter what i say, whatever im just some lonely schmuck who now has nobody to talk to except for strangers on the internet haha
lonelyanddepressedaf	ultimate fear of what would happen.  try to kill myself, fail and then be physically unable to kill myself. 
lonelyanddepressedaf	Yeah, experiencing now.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	yes.  i lack any sort of physical affection let alone normal affection
lonelyanddepressedaf	Got drunk for the first time last night, felt true happiness for the first time in a while | i was at a wedding and nobody seemed to care i was drinking so i helped myself.  after i was dizzy drunk and on top of the world.  for once it didnt feel like i was distracting myself from depression.  anyone else experience this, ive heard that being drunk can actually trigger the exact opposite of what i felt.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	I know that feel man, it's the worst feeling ever.  You need to move on because she's only going to hurt you more.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	a small part of my family would miss me bad.  i dont think any of my friends would really care, theyd be over it within a few months.  it would destroy part of my family if i killed myself.  also i have a dream that one day ill be comfortable laying on a bed with a dog in one arm and a loving girlfriend in the other.  cringe, i know, but god damn do i wish i had anything like that.
lonelyanddepressedaf	falling asleep listening to music sounds nice.  I get what you mean, i feel like even when i am doing something, it's just a distraction from being depressed.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	I feel you, man.  I feel like if I just said what I wanted to say, I'd be ostracized.  I also have some health problems that can make being nervous or getting excited physically painful.  It really fucking sucks, and everything seems downhill.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I feel like my friends arent my friends | I cant talk about how i feel with them.  they wouldnt get it, and the one person i did trust to tell doesnt care anymore.  my most trusted friend betrayed me, and i feel like the one who has been most loyal wont understand.  i just wish i could loathe with someone, nobody ever seems to want to now.  oh well guess ill just let my inner frustrations and shortcomings fester until I have a breakdown.
lonelyanddepressedaf	thought I made a step in the right direction, now I feel more shitty than before | before at least there was hope.  Hope that one day I might have a meaningful relationship.  Now I know how silly I was being.  Me?  Relationship?  Ha.  Maybe for our friendships sake it was good to remain friends but now I feel more alone than ever.  I feel like I have nobody irl to vent to.  Sure I have my therapist, but I can never get the nerve to tell him the whole truth.   I feel like that you can trust nobody in this world and thinking you can is setting yourself up for dissapointment.  the worst part is that I feel like I shouldnt even try to feel better.  I feel like giving up and ending it.  I really should at this point.  After all people wouldnt be missing *me*.  Theyd be missing the shell I project out to everybody.  My closest friends dont know much if anything about my depression, and the person I did tell I dont think I can fully talk to her like I did.  And i dont even know why.  I want to, but i cant.  I commented recently on a well thought out paragraph that actually helped me a few days ago, something about seeing the light at a tunnel, even though it's far away.  That light is fading quick.  Im losing hope.  I should give up really.  I want to sit alone and cry myself to sleep but im so used to bottling it up i cant cry anymore.  I want to cry so fucking bad.  I guess ill just talk to her tonight and keep projecting the aforementioned shell.  FUCK.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I think at first she really understood me, but now it seems she really couldn't care less.    I guess I could tell her what I said here but I feel like it would be falling on deaf ears.  You said you were in a similar situation, and if you want to talk I'll do you the same courtesy you showed me.
lonelyanddepressedaf	2meirl4meirl | 
lonelyanddepressedaf	I broke down hysterically and it was pretty clear what was going on from that point.
lonelyanddepressedaf	I don't know.  I've thought about suicide for a long time and the longer it goes on the less scared you are by it.  I remember the first time wishing I was dead I was shocked by myself.  Now it's common place and i'm starting to get more again.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Do higher-ups know this?  
lonelyanddepressedaf	What a fucking asshole.  How could someone be so stone cold?
lonelyanddepressedaf	Too much.  It hurts.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Same here.  It's 'not you it's me' kinda deal.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Weight off My Chest | I did good today.  I saved my most meaningul friendship that I have and prevented a catastrophic heartbreak.  Last week, I was planning on telling someone I've been talking to for about 7 months now that I love her.  Today, I've had a complete shift in mind.  I decided that I liked what we have as of now (talking every day) and that losing that is the worst possible situation.  So, I told her this.  I told her about my previous plans as well just because I want to remain completely transparent with her.  She agreed and said that she liked what we had and that we should pursue our own relationships.  This is a good step for me.  Had I gone through with my past plan I would have embarrassed myself, lost my most meaningful friendship, and prevented another catastrophe like the last times.  Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.  I guess the hardest part now is getting over the fact that I wasted so many hours thinking about it.  I've probably accumulated days' worth of time thinking about us.
lonelyanddepressedaf	Thanks, man.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	somebody tell me what the fucking point in trying is anymore | ive lost the plot.  why should i even try to care anymore?  its so stressful, and everytime i care it always seems to bite me in the ass.  where the fuck do people get the motivation to keep living?  i get attached to people too fast and even when i purposefully control myself so i dont get attached too fast I still end up getting hurt.  i feel like my whole life is just going to be this big waiting game for something that will likely never come.  I spent 7 months thinking every day about one person, making sure that we were compatible, she showed interest and so did I.  now when i decide that I should go all-in I get hurt.  And this isnt even the first time ive full invested myself in a person emotionally, and it ended just the same.  i dont think ill ever learn. fffffffffffffffffffffuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkckckckckcckffujcuccfjkucfjcfujcfujdxflkhgbdflbfyl
lonelyanddepressedaf	Thanks for that, man.  That light may be a hell of a long time away, but at least it exists.  I too have a big procrastination problem, but it exists a lot more in my education rather than my social life.  I have a much more 'rip the band-aid off' approach to my social life than i do to everything else.  I think it's because instead of focusing on my education, I'm always focusing on what's happening socially.  It's difficult right now, but I have some hope that eventually I'll be satisfied with my life.
lonelyanddepressedaf	FeelsBadMan.  I'm highly considering suicide as it is now, if I wait any longer I'll be dead.  That really sucks, man.
lonelyanddepressedaf	take out the hookups and you have how Ive felt the entirety of the past year
lonelyanddepressedaf	Sure am. >~<
lonelyanddepressedaf	Sounds like you're already doing well.  When it comes to depression and anxiety, sometimes there's really not much you can do to help.  Just make sure that you give him attention and make sure he feels loved.  Pay attention to what he says and understand that even when he opens up to you a lot of times it can just be the tip of the iceberg.  If he's suicidal, just make sure you check up on him when he seems off or if he's being quiet and uncommunicative.  He's lucky to have someone like you caring for him :)
lonelyanddepressedaf	god im so fucking lonely | its overwhelming.  its the weekend and i wanted to do shit because its summer but i guess not i guess ill just stay inside all weekend on reddit.  sorry for the shitpost i just need to vent  because im a worthless lonely loser piece of shit
lonelyanddepressedaf	You look like Adam Sandler's degenerate brother.
lonelyanddepressedaf	depends really, some of them make me angry because they trivialize mental illness and say the generic quotes that they always do like 'itll get better' blah blah blah.  One that really got to me was a video by Anna Akana titled 'Please dont kill yourself' where she talks about her sister's suicide.  It made me feel really selfish and guilty for wanting to die.  
lonelyanddepressedaf	wow.  Some people just don't get it, don't take it too rough.
lonelyanddepressedaf	its my fault for getting too attached too quick and expecting that people will be honest about what they say.  I let myself get hurt and now im getting hurt again because im a dumb fucking moron that apparently doesnt learn from the past.
lonelyanddepressedaf	yup, and considering that im tons more depressed than i was friday work is going to be 10x as worse.  i swear im wasting away my life
frankulfu	She was right. There was no way out. | The title is my favorite quote, from The Stranger by Albert Camus; a great read.  I love it because it's so simple, yet it somehow manages to encompass so much. All of the effort and hardships to try and make some progress, yet somehow it always works it's way back to the beginning. Hopeless.
frankulfu	I had a very similar experience the other day. I distinctly remember feeling happy, smiling as I woke up. But then reality started to settle in, and I could physically feel myself sinking further into my bed. Ended up staying in bed the entire day.
sadhumanthrow	Depression and lying | It's been a bad day, well a bad past few months.  I moved to CA for a job and basically I'm isolated. I don't have much in common with the people here and have a long distance relationship that takes up a lot of my time.   I have nothing here. I hate the weekends because at least at work, I'm making money and have things to do sometimes. On the weekends I just kind of lounge around or stay on the phone until we are both sick of being on the phone. I feel like I'm not providing anything either really.  Today, I did something stupid. I went to a bar. The stupid part actually was that when my SO called me at the bar I tried to pretend I was home until they sniffed it out and caught me in a lie. I don't even know why I lied exactly.   I think I was embarrassed that I was there and in a lot of ways hated myself for it and didnt want my SO to worry.   I just have nothing to do. I've tried to find local meetups for boardgames, but the card shops here suck and the one group that looked good on meetups never got back to me. I tried volunteering at the library, but they actually are pretty set on volunteers.  The only thing I have found to do here is Pokemon Go. There's a decent scene, but if I can't find an event for that going on, I'm basically in my room studying for an exam or otherwise wasting time. I fucking hate this, man. I feel utterly useless.   I'm getting off topic now, but it's been cathartic writing this all out. Back to the main point. I lied to cover up the fact that I was doing something I felt made me "not good enough." The action itself didn't matter but lying made me "not good enough." Does anyone else do this?  I feel like I developed this habit from trying to hide how I was really doing from people so they wouldn't worry, but now it's alienating me even more. Has anyone else experienced this or know how to stop yourself from doing it?
BitchesBHating	There's some irony here 
BitchesBHating	1.Check phone-nothing 2.check Netflix-nothing 3. Think about life- suffer near seizure like convulsions of shame and regret 4. Repeat | Become so desensitized that you take dangerous drugs in not well researched combos. Try to convince yourself that their is that golden day over the horizon. Check phone again and dive back into that familiar emotional dump. 
BitchesBHating	Ya you sound a lot like me, I cannot stand when im off and have somewhere to be. Quitting k has forced me to confront this though. At this point I feel like the first 30/40 are just the start. 
BitchesBHating	Cheers mate. I like store kumbucha but the homemade stuff looked too nasty for this bruH. 
BitchesBHating	The consensus seems to be for the Ksm 66 formula
BitchesBHating	Day 70 I'm good when life is going smoothly, when problems come up I still often go into that omg I cannot deal kind of place.'I don't really crave kratom but I do crave a sense of security.
BitchesBHating	God I wish I didn't know this first hand, it's torture. 
BitchesBHating	Ya I'm coming around, I think there's that glamor in discovering a drug when alcohol is like your steady old partner. Still got it though. 
BitchesBHating	Lucky you 
BitchesBHating	Would anybody be an alcoholic with unlimited pills/powders | I am just curious how people feel the appeal of alcohol would remain/go down if every drug was legalized. To be honest I am someone who enjoys alcohol but it is kind of an exhausting drug in that you have to constantly imbibe something that tastes bad/burns your throat to maintain a buzz. As opposed to taking some pills/tabs or snorting something that doesn't sit heavy on you. This is probably mainly a way for me not to crave other shit so heavially so take this as it comes.. 
BitchesBHating	I feel like a Reddit account is something for the person alone, anyway day 70'here still healing. Sometimes on a tough day I pretend it's day 1 so I go easy on myself for struggling.
BitchesBHating	Agreed. 
BitchesBHating	I think most of you are right, I think my problem was that I was drinking alone today which is never as fun. 
BitchesBHating	That's an interesting take on the question. 
BitchesBHating	Ya but you could show up to a hangout on your favorite pills and no one would really know unless you took it really far. 
BitchesBHating	Yup all the time. In a recent one i blended lsd and mdma into a pill and then took it and ended up knocking some cops off a flying carpet. Sounds made up when I write it, but was an odd dream not even particularly fun.'
BitchesBHating	Were from? 
BitchesBHating	Ya I think you should. Confidentiality protects you in this relationship and it is key to what is happening to you. 
BitchesBHating	You should really see a therapist. You can look and see if there are any affordable options near you. You basically had a trauma with the bad trio and it is still effecting you. 
BitchesBHating	Did I really say that, I'm a worthless idiot who's screwed,
BitchesBHating	Anxiety 
BitchesBHating	I needed to hear this as I'm still struggling day 65, like,it's better but I am far from where I want to be.
BitchesBHating	I lost what was once a good friend, his blue pill way of thinking got harder and harder to tolerate. When I shared my perspective on the value of reason and cutting through bullshit, he shamed me for not being a perfect liberal snowflake.
BitchesBHating	I have the constant burping this as well, gaba doesn't stop it but it does reduce the intensity and let me focus on other stuff. Like work and conversations with people. I take 1200. 
BitchesBHating	And thus a new fetish is born. 
BitchesBHating	Sure I'm sure it's true, it's just that pain puts me in a negative frame of mind. I cannot always change it the same way I cant will pain away. And people are really often not doing the best they can, people are often dong the minimum to tread water, look at any office. 
BitchesBHating	Good into bad for sure, I am a naturally very sweet person but 10 years of chronic pain and being misunderstood... I am not bad but I am not nice. 
BitchesBHating	I just lost a friendship due in part to chronic pain. This friend accused me of being judgemental and thought it was sad that I don't do relationships. He didn't get that as someone born with a defective body i sometimes judge people for the way they squander their potential. 
BitchesBHating	So I've quit and I'm still not sure it was the right decision.  I say enjoy yourself for now, I wanted to quit because it mest up my appetite and I want to put on some muscle. It was so nice to have in daily life though. 
BitchesBHating	I switched recently too as gaming became too stressful and I have a lifelong love of reading. 
BitchesBHating	I was addicted to kratom and used to nod hard all the time, or a couple times a weak at least. 
BitchesBHating	Can people read this title and not cringe? 
BitchesBHating	I think that's because IT is kinda wholesome in a way, Steven king wrote a great Massive novel on the protective aspect of friendship and the power of facing fear and staying true. Other horror movies I would still avoid as many of them don't have the same reeding qualities. I would highly recommend the book, it was wonderful for my anxiety. 
BitchesBHating	Trying, the insecure part of me wants to hold on. Am I working on it and see my therapist today. 
BitchesBHating	Yup for a really strong trip its Jazz all the way for me
BitchesBHating	One thing I have noticed sense quitting K is that I can actually put on muscle and get restful sleep. These two things have reduced my pain and I hope that through improved health and posture I can lesson my pain levels further. 
BitchesBHating	Yes for sure. It turned out that person was a chronic petty thief and malicious liar. I really believe in the intuitive sense of a person and it has served me well. 
BitchesBHating	Ya I'm down
BitchesBHating	Ya I had such a great time, my mind filled in all the spaces of the jazz with these wonderful images, I was full of stimulation but chilled. I think it was my defining trip because I learned a lesson that was crucial to my personal journey, which is that I am so one who loves fun, and to love, let other people take on the heavy and the esoteric. 
BitchesBHating	When friendships no longer feel right | I have a situation where I have a friendship and this friend let me down in several ways, and I feel disappointed in him.    I thought he was more reasonable but it turns out he bases all of his decisions on astrology and fate and I have a vested interest in trying to engage with the world in a way that owns my personal responsibility. I consider myself a spiritual and open person but I cannot stand not owning that your choices are because you want or need to do things, not because the stars commanded you or fate led you. 
BitchesBHating	GABAPENTIN is a godsend for me, I wish I could share with a doctor it's benefit for my gerd, I only got a temporary script for something else. 
BitchesBHating	I have such hope every morning, only to start my day with some of the old timey keep living let down juice. 
BitchesBHating	Stopped watching when he set the frying pan directly on the table, am a dude.
BitchesBHating	According to the GRE, reading comprehension.
BitchesBHating	I think the whole point was that they needed something real to remind them that they were human, even if it was imperfect and messy. I admit to being surprised by the scene, but felt it made a sort of sense.  
BitchesBHating	I guarantee you Louis ck's lazy ass isn't cooking eggs on low. I can't even get anyone in my family to do that, even though it makes flipping a fried egg a dream. 
BitchesBHating	Haha ty! I feel like the way someone cooks says so much about them. 
BitchesBHating	Hopefully someone has some good advice. I'm really new to the med but it's been a lifesaver for me, the difference in me finally being able to quit Kratom. I don't take it daily though. 
BitchesBHating	Season 3 is way smarter, makes your mind feel engaged. 
BitchesBHating	Are you on anti acids? Or possibly you take much in one go, I think like 500 mg absorbs at a time. 
BitchesBHating	I cried too, and was deeply moved. It stuck with me for a while. 
BitchesBHating	Why it's such a beautiful display of love 
BitchesBHating	I have a little dog and she doesn't bark. I'm so in love with her after saying for years I don't like little dogs. I totally nailed this answer didn't I? 
BitchesBHating	Wish my dad kept my mom in check when she went into rages. Wish they both kicked my brother out when he started leaving dirty needles around and stealing our stuff. Instead of arguing with him and nothing changing. 
BitchesBHating	I agree with the risk with elders etc, but that is not a display of dominance. 
BitchesBHating	I usually do a 24 hour rule for possible bad interactions, but I err on the side of caution.
BitchesBHating	Its so hard! 
BitchesBHating	Are you serious 4 pushups? I do reps of 40 and I consider myself at a pretty weak place in my life, and im not bashing myself I'm being honest and objective. 
BitchesBHating	I dont get the joke? What is the fat one saying I'm confused. XD
BitchesBHating	Judge- maybe if I show how tolerant and understanding I am I will get some puss (love)-somehow cause fuck logic. 
BitchesBHating	This would be like the coolest way to introduce the confirmed existence of unicorns. 
BitchesBHating	Ive been pouring that way for a while now, because i get full ez. bonus points if you transfer to another glass. 
BitchesBHating	Gabapentin, new love of mine. 
BitchesBHating	I'm still struggling with sleep at day 50 it's 6 am and I don't have to work early today. 
BitchesBHating	Going to do a steam room/massage combo and then cook paella so I'm looking forward to that. My appetite still so so but if I make food delicious enough it helps a lot. 
BitchesBHating	Don't be discouraged though, I have my life back. 
BitchesBHating	Well to be fair, I dont think most of us are in the shit posting mood 
BitchesBHating	You say that but there isn't much magical about jerking it for 5 hours in a quest for the perfect pic or vid whilst being dehydrated and entering realms of degeneracy you were only vaguely aware could exist in the human soul. 
BitchesBHating	Bernie was way to white knight towards Hillary, A classic example of losing because you are trying to virtue signal while doing something important.
BitchesBHating	Day-50  Still really hard but in terms of being a functional person it is night and day. I worked a 12 hour day and went home not feeling like death. My push up reps are up to around 40 and I have pounds of muscle and am lean as opposed to skinny fat. Still hard af though 6 hour sleep or less is the norm, fears of life falling apart are the norm, fears that i have been out of the sexuality realm to long etc, but i have been noticing positive attention from women.
BitchesBHating	IM down to ban him from here for posting that shit
BitchesBHating	Anxiety 
BitchesBHating	I am certain, especially in a causal non serious racist sense. 
BitchesBHating	All well and good until your friend who did it recently wasted half their money buying shitty dj equipment from someone that had judge me red flags on them they ignored.
BitchesBHating	Has to be a joke
BitchesBHating	Ya I think it's not a stretch to say he was doing a desperate cry for help. You are one of the rare people that see something and act, instead of turning away. You did a good thing and this trait will serve you well in your own growth. I'm glad to have got a chance to talk with you.
BitchesBHating	Legend
BitchesBHating	I loved it from the start. I watched the first episode on mescaline and it spoke to me in so many ways. The theme song intros still seems trippy to me, no matter how many times I watch it. Cycles of life and ego and all that jazz.
BitchesBHating	Sorry bro I didn't know :(  I discovered gabapentin recently and I enjoy it like twice a week. I know the struggle tho, weed makes me think I'm dying, speed makes me weird. Mdma I want to dose compulsively, but I hate being sober. 
BitchesBHating	It might just not be for you anymore, that's how it is for me. Plenty more drugs in the sea.
BitchesBHating	Also the age of everyone being neriotic, depressed, and unhappy with magical tools and riches. 
BitchesBHating	I've done a similar thing for my brother and I know he feels grateful even though he's never said. 
BitchesBHating	Cold turkey now, its your best option. It's up to you whether or not you can take it however. 
BitchesBHating	I'm on my way to the store for some new foods, thanks for the inspiration. You did a mitzvah today! 
BitchesBHating	You have given me hope for my gerd, something I have not felt in a while. My struggle with low carb is that my throat is Inflamed from gerd and I can't swallow some meats very easily. Was this something you dealt with?  Either way I am going on a big shop and giving this a real try, regretting my toast breakfast before this though.

BitchesBHating	Feeling like I can't face a 12 hour work day without it, feeling like I am dying... it's never a good idea and this is potentially triggering stuff. But it's those things that led to,terrible choices.

BitchesBHating	Ya vice is becoming like a propaganda site

BitchesBHating	There is much pressure and a tide trying to force us to idolize them, serve them, that some disrespect helps me personally to balance all the propaganda. 
BitchesBHating	Enquiring minds...

BitchesBHating	Threw up, almost cancelled, but I'm going to my friends wedding. | I'm taking a short flight to my friends wedding and I'm terrified because I am not feeling that well. I'm scared of being at the table not being able go eat or make conversation. Of looking silly in my suit.  But I am deciding to not let anxiety hold me prisoner, this time I am going. Maybe I will have a bad time and I won't go anywhere for a while, but this time I am going!
BitchesBHating	I needed to be reminded of this.
BitchesBHating	How often do you do mdma types substances a month? 
BitchesBHating	My throats feels tight often, especially when nervous. In addition I have to sort of burp all the time. 
tiredofbeingsad1233	Don't know why I try anymore | Today I woke up feeling pretty good. Kinda rare for me but I wasn't about to question it. I got dressed and decided to go see a parade happening in my town with my step dad but he wanted to stay home and watch football instead. I didn't know this so he dropped me off and I was alone. No sweat-my sister was at the parade as well with her-many-friends. Well she turned her phone off and after like 20 minutes of trying to find her or get ahold of her I gave up and walked back to my place, crying. This type of scenario happens more than I'd like to admit to the point where I can be rather stealthy with my crying in public. I'm just so tired of trying to go out and have a nice day when I just end up regretting it and crying myself to sleep almost every night. I have few friends so it's my fault of assuming I could watch it was family without planning anything first. I just don't know how to make myself feel happier-my sister called me twenty minutes ago apologizing and asking if I had been crying which I of course lied about. The situation isn't even that bad but I literally sat here bawling for god knows how long and alone. I never used to be this sensitive and moody but the longer I've had depression the easier it is to see the worst in every situation and completely overreact. I just kinda had to vent about all this, thanks to anyone who actually read this far.
wwf1234	Does anyone else feel depressed when they watch TV shows from their childhood? | Whenever I watch Teen Titans I start to get nostalgic and depressed because it reminds of the simpler times. I used to watch the show all the time as a kid, and I was actually happy and glad to be alive back then. But now, when I watch the show it reminds me of how much I wanna go back to the past.
wwf1234	Thank you.
wwf1234	You're not alone with the guilt you're feeling. I too have done despicable things in the past; part of it is the reason I want to die. 
wwf1234	Nigga I'm not reading all of that.
wwf1234	Show me solid evidence that there is life beyond this earth.   Claiming extraterrestrial life exists sounds just as ridiculous as telling me that a god exists. 
wwf1234	There is no extraterrestrial life in this universe.
wwf1234	[People = Shit](https://youtu.be/qqK1FrO3BdM)
wwf1234	I don't think your girlfriend's cats suffered a painful death. They're much more sensitive to Carbon Monoxide than we are, so they would have died of inhalation, not burning.
wwf1234	Fuck I'm gonna miss you :(
wwf1234	From an outside perspective it looks like you're having a psychotic mental breakdown.
wwf1234	Safe travels my man. It was a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you find peace in death.
wwf1234	Mmm hmm. Right back atcha brother.
wwf1234	It's not good to make assumptions. My username is actually referring to the World Wildlife Foundation, not World Wrestling  Federation. 
wwf1234	My original punishment was a communication ban, now it has changed to completely not being able to play any multiplayer games for 3 weeks.
wwf1234	No offense but how tf do you not know who Joey is?  EDIT: Hey guys, I get the joke now. Please stop with the downvotes.  
wwf1234	Ooh, I'm feeling the passive aggressiveness with this one.
wwf1234	Can people with low IQ's do well on the SAT? | So I suffer from a low IQ (not really my fault, mostly genetics) and was wondering if the SAT is based on intelligence rather than strategy. Every time I finish reading an SAT passage my brain starts to hurt and I have trouble understanding the main idea. When I look at SAT questions I have trouble coming up with an answer. 
wwf1234	I just wanted to apologize for saying all that shit, man. I was just jealous because you mentioned having a girlfriend and that's something I will never have.
wwf1234	?
wwf1234	Yo r/ZIPP0, I'm just curious: are you actively suicidal or are you just lurking around here? 
wwf1234	I'm sorry if I came off as an asshole. I just got pissed off when you mentioned having a girlfriend, even though you post on r/incels.
wwf1234	People aren't lying when they say "your childhood is the best part of your life."
wwf1234	Fuck the assholes that downvoted this.
wwf1234	I will never find the courage to kill myself | Does anyone else feel this way? Do you feel like you're too much of a coward and a sissy to go through with suicide. It's not that I'm afraid of death, it's that I'm afraid of the pain and agony that comes when you try to kill yourself. Ideally, hanging seemed like the best option to me, but after doing some careful research I've come to the conclusion that it isn't the best way to go. Many hanging victims say your head feels like a ballon that's about to pop.  So how the fuck can I kill myself? Also, I was wondering what you guys thought about the trolls on this sub who say that using Nembutal is a pussy way to die, and that only "real men" use hanging.
wwf1234	Wow, you're right man. Very well said.
wwf1234	True. I'm actually surprised that shotgun to the head has an agony rating of 5.5  Maybe because by the time your brain registers anything half of your face is blown off.
wwf1234	Is it morally wrong and corrupt to join the military or police force? 
wwf1234	Yeah man I've been doing a few test trials lately. So here's my problem: I don't have a rope nor have the money or resources to be able to purchase one. So I wanted to hang myself using everyday common items like a towel or a laptop charger. Do you think its possible?   
wwf1234	Lostalllhope.com says that gunshot to the head has an agony rating of 13.5. (scale from 0-100)
wwf1234	Why is that? Is it because they're bored? it's weird because downvoting is disabled by default on this sub.
wwf1234	It's not a matter of bravery, it's being able to handle the pain of killing yourself. I want to hang myself, but people say that hanging feels like your head is a ballon about to pop.
wwf1234	Bad bot 
wwf1234	Thank you so much. I'm gonna passively kill myself by putting the most toxic things in my body.
wwf1234	I wish I had a terminal illness so that I wouldn't have to kill myself | It's so much easier to be diagnosed with cancer and die, than have to kill yourself. I've had it with life. I'm sick of fighting depression day in and day out. I know there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that can be done to fix my life and the horrible decisions I've made. But I can't do anything, I am a coward. I can't find the courage nor have the balls to kill myself. I'm afraid of snapping my neck during hanging, or having my guts splatter everywhere with gunshot.
wwf1234	Of course they're not gonna say drugs had to do with his leave; it'll make both the band and Joey look bad. If Paul dying had to do with him leaving, then Joey would have left before 2013.  We still haven't been given a proper explanation for Joey quitting. That is something that will probably never be disclosed. 
wwf1234	:(
wwf1234	Are you sure? Wouldn't you feel some sort of heat entering your skull?
wwf1234	The feeling of a bullet tearing through your skin and flesh sounds unpleasant and painful.
wwf1234	Oh yeah, I remember watching this video a few years ago. Maybe bullets travel so fast that your brain doesn't even have time to register what's happened. Definently seems like a bloody way to go out though. 
wwf1234	Yep. That's the same impending faith I have as well. Once my mother dies, I will become homeless and live on the streets. Hopefully that drives me to the edge of suicide. 
wwf1234	Has anyone on this sub successfully cut PMO from their life forever or is this just a jokes and giggles kind of thing? | 
wwf1234	So beautifully worded.
wwf1234	Yes but those are the people who have regular sex. It's bullshit because they have a sexual release.
wwf1234	I'm asking you if anyone has completely removed PMO from their life. All I see on this sub are day 10, 20, and 30 streaks. I can't recall the last time I've seen someone go longer than a year.
wwf1234	Your girlfriends a fucking idiot.
wwf1234	Growing up in a crummy apartment, there were cockroaches everywhere in our home. I remember being around 11 and laying down on the floor  and having a cockroach crawl across my neck the next. This was a traumatic experience for me and gave me the fear of insects. Being afraid of cockroach doesn't mean you're a pussy.
wwf1234	Well after they release their next 2 albums I think that's gonna be the end of Slipknot. It's obvious that they just can't keep up with the daily demands of playing in a heavy metal band while they're all in their 40s and 50s.  It's sad, but all good things must come to an end :( 
wwf1234	I took some cool photos from the Sulfur music video and combined them into one colleague. | 
wwf1234	Don't listen to any of these idiots. Your sister probably has depression or something. Just give her some space and let her know that you care about her and want her to do something worthwhile with her life.
wwf1234	What?
wwf1234	You can blame the golden boy for that. He's been pretty vague, and has  been avoiding the whole situation. Look at Joey now, I bet he's going through depression after what they did to him. He's gained weight, lost his once good drumming abilities, and just looks unhealthy in general.
wwf1234	It was a spelling mistake. No need to be picky, friend? 
wwf1234	They certainly played a factor. And would you really believe that he quit his drug addiction? It's one of the toughest things to quit, and he's probably relapsed on/off. Also, drugs could have caused his bone disease. 
wwf1234	[No. Drug addiction is something he has battled his whole life.](http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slipknot-drummer-on-his-battle-with-drugs-i-was-basically-dying/)
wwf1234	Had a drug addiction, bone disease that made his drumming utter shit, carried off and on stage for his last few shows, and worked on so many other projects that it pissed Corey off and kicked him from the band.
wwf1234	Yeah, I tried to be sneaky and remove that mark but the damn program wouldn't let me.
wwf1234	I haven't thought about killing myself in 2 days. 
wwf1234	Many metal fans struggle with depression (including myself), just know that you aren't alone. I'm more of a Slipknot guy than A7x, but I'm always down for a conversation, man.
wwf1234	You'll just end up dying miserable shitting your bed in the hospital like most depressed people who don't kill themselves. 
wwf1234	Psychosocial is a good song;I don't care about how much hate it gets on this stupid sub. 
wwf1234	Your first mistake is assuming that my favorite Slipknot album was Iowa or Self-Titled, it's actually AHIG. But anyway, .5 the Gray Chapter is a solid album, but doesn't even compare to Slipknot's older albums. The vocals are pretty mediocre ( Corey was smoking at the time), and the lyrics are so-so. Guitar work is a bit sloppy compared to the sophistication and complexity of the guitars on AHIG.  But yeah, the majority of Slipknot fans agree that .5 is NOT the best Slipknot album. Far from it, my friend. 
wwf1234	If you think $70 isn't too pricey for a DVD, then you must be filthy rich.
wwf1234	Why? Self-titled has some of their best songs like (sic), Surfacing, Eyeless, and Wait and Bleed. Why do you think their live set list is dominated by most of their self-titled songs. Because the album is a masterpiece!
wwf1234	.5 is NOT the best album. Not sure why you think that way.
wwf1234	That dumbass who designed that shirt pissed all over the legacy that Joey left behind for Slipknot. What's the point of selling your album t-shirt if it's gonna exclude one of the key members who contributed massively to the album. 
wwf1234	Looks pretty nice but the body seems disproportional to the head. 
wwf1234	Whoever excluded Joey from the self-titled and AHIG shirts should be fired immediately. The self titled shirt looked like garbage after being flipped and removing Joey.
wwf1234	I'll give you tree fiddy.
wwf1234	He's a pretty smart guy, but he does have his moments.
wwf1234	It will most likely be a double album. It will be their last because their record deal says they have to make 2 more albums. I think by the next album Jay and Alex would have become official members of the band. Hopefully they get their own unique masks instead of the generic skull mask. 
wwf1234	Now they're taking him off the self-titled shirts too? The fuck is this? 
wwf1234	What an intelligent being, may his soul rest in peace.
wwf1234	Yes - you just don't see their names around here anymore. At least 100 people who have visited this sub have successfully committed suicide. 
wwf1234	I know man, but  a snapped neck. Imagine how painful and agonizing that will be.
wwf1234	So because there is no blood flow to the brain, it shuts down and your body stops working?
wwf1234	Are you my twin?
wwf1234	If your neck doesn't snap on the inital drop then you will be strangled to death. It will be painful and you will try to scratch and claw your way out.  I've thought about hanging numerous times, but am afraid that my neck will snap when I hang myself. If my neck doesn't snap, then I'll just be choked to death and that will be painful.
wwf1234	Shit - I must have miscounted. 
wwf1234	Your comment captures my state of mind perfectly: I am a coward who wants to die, but is afraid to do so.   
wwf1234	What are 5 words that describe you? | For me:  Depressed, chronic masturbator, ugly, socially retarded, and unintelligent.
wwf1234	Sorry. I just wanted to have someone to talk to. 
wwf1234	I thought you were referring to my post as shit? 
wwf1234	I am all of those things.
wwf1234	Good list.
wwf1234	Unintelligent?
wwf1234	I told him that I appreciated his list because he had a wide variety of artists like NIN, Slipknot, and Bigge.
wwf1234	This is the most cliche quote I've heard.
wwf1234	My life is a joke too! It seems like everyone hates me on the internet and in real life.
wwf1234	I'm asexual, and there are barley any asexual people on this planet. Guess I'm going to die alone! 
wwf1234	They would leave me in a heartbeat because I wouldn't be able to satisfy their "sexual needs".
wwf1234	Exactly lmao. Where's the fucking logic behind that?
wwf1234	They're trying to erase Joey from Slipknot history, and he's one of the founding members of the band, lmao.
wwf1234	I'm more of a Slipknot guy, but yeah, Corey Taylor and Stone Sour have both helped me get through a lot of rough shit.
wwf1234	I would kill just to return back to my childhood.
wwf1234	Because it's embedded in our genes to reproduce and people don't care about the potential consequences that come with having a child during sex.
wwf1234	 Your perception of people's lives are skewed.  First of all, 80% of the world population is living on less than $10 a day. Put that into perspective. If there's food in your fridge and clothes in your closet you're already in the top 20% on a global scale. Second, the WHO has estimated that 300 million people suffer from depression. And it's already on its way to become the #1 disability. If anything, your life is better than most.
wwf1234	Ever heard of commas? 
wwf1234	Yes, I'm too scared to make my next move because I already know what will happen if I decide to choose either option.   
wwf1234	Seeking validation through a bot? That's pathetic mate.
wwf1234	  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   Don't know what to tell ya.
eaglesnation11	I did it to my gf once and it was super hot. If you're interested in taboo totally do it. Just remember to brush your teeth afterwards if you wanna do anything else with your mouth.
eaglesnation11	I'd rather die than fail | I'm 21. Been struggling with depression since 13. Had suicidal thoughts nearly every day since then and I'm finally realizing I don't have a reason not to do it. Sure it will cause a lot of pain to those who love me but I can't keep living. I never feel good enough and I feel like a huge burden to those around me. I can imagine my life is what hell is like. Every time I gain a pound, spend a dollar, have a fight with my gf, or struggle with something professionally or academically it feels like it's the end of the world and I feel either fat, broke, I feel like my gf hates me or I feel stupid. I'm done. And I can't wait until the pain ends one way or the other.

Enjoy yourself and don't care about what anyone else thinks.
eaglesnation11	I do get help. I recently started medication and go to therapy from time to time. I just have this fear that she's only staying with me so I won't kill myself.

eaglesnation11	Is going to the game really worth it? | So I went to the Preseason game last night and was reminded why I don't really go see games in person anymore. From the moment I pulled into the parking lot I was slapped with a $40 parking fee. It was $25 last time I went. It didn't take long to get into the stadium but remember it's preseason. I remember one time I went to see the Eagles Cowboys Sunday Night football game and I got in line by 8:00 and I missed half of the first quarter!! I waited 45 minutes just to get into the game! Then last night I decided I was gonna bite the bullet and order $12 crab fries from Chickies and Petes that are really just French fries and old bay. When you think about it the profit margin for those fries very well could be $10 for every cup they sell. So I'm in line to but my overpriced crab fries and after 15 minutes and the line doesn't move and after I realized I missed seeing Kendricks pick 6 in person I got the hell out of line. The beers at the stadium were $9 which is usual but still nothing I would even consider buying. I get there's nothing like seeing football live but at what point do you say enough is enough? You could easily see the entire game on television on time without interruption order an entire large pizza for what you would get a pail of crab fries for and get a six pack of beers for the price of one. Plus when it's half time and you go and try to go to the bathroom so you won't miss the actual game you won't have to wait 20 minutes for a urinal. Going to the game anymore is just a big hassle and money hole that I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

eaglesnation11	How many teams have you seen in person? | So my entire life my goal has been to visit all 50 states and I know a lot of people have the same goal as me. But for some reason it came to me yesterday that it'd be pretty cool to see all 32 teams play in person. I'm only 21 and I've seen 17 of 32 teams play in person. My Dad was an Eagles season ticket holder for 20 years. It was kind of hard to remember all the games I've seen but I was wondering if anyone has a similar list or can remember how many teams they've seen play in person. Regular season or Playoff games only. Here's my list:   DAL x2 NYG x2 WSH x2 PHI- every game GB x2 ATL NO SF AZ NE BAL IND JAX  KC x2 OAK SD DEN

eaglesnation11	SCARED TO DEATH | Hi all I'm going to be a student teacher in about two weeks and am losing my mind! I am going to be teaching three sections of Honors World History, and possibly a section of AP Government and Politics and a section of American Law. It's been absolutely killing me. Pretty much all summer I've been flipping through textbooks and PowerPoints trying to come up with brilliant lesson plans, but I'm afraid all of my lessons will be too boring or not challenging enough for an Honors or AP student. I'm scared of failing my student teaching and letting everyone I care about down. We only need to reach the most basic level of performance for every domain of the Danielson model, but right now I'm doubting that I can even reach that. Besides that EdTPA is also on my mind as it's the first year New Jersey is using it. Although there is no cut score it will certainly be a ton of work. Can anyone help calm me down. Thank You!

eaglesnation11	This is a discussion my Dad and I had. He's pissed the Sixers drafted a bum over a tall dude who can shoot. But I really think because of that mistake we overall have a better team. He also wanted us to trade the number one pick this year for Kristaps straight up rofl
eaglesnation11	What if the Sixers drafted Kristaps over Jah? | Would we have still gotten the #1 pick in 2016 to draft Simmons? What about Fultz? Would Dario Saric be a sixth man or traded? Overall would our future look brighter or dimmer than it does right now?

eaglesnation11	No support from family | Hi all! I'm currently in a teacher's education program at a small college in NJ. I Student teach in the Fall! Woooo!!!!  I like it a lot but unfortunately most of my family doesn't agree with me. Entering college I told everyone I wanted to be a lawyer and I did, but I always knew I had a passion for teaching so I decided to go into education to do something I always really knew I would end up doing. Anyways I kind of knew that a lot of my family was thinking I was taking the easy way out because they thought I just didn't want to put in the work to go to law school. The real tipping point though was when my Mom and sister said to my face "Teaching is easy." I know others have experienced this and I want to know how you shake off and respond to the comments that being a teacher is easy without erupting? Thanks.

eaglesnation11	Who won the Celtics/Sixers trade? Grades? | Reports:  PHI- 1st overall pick BOS- 3rd overall pick, 2018 Lakers Pick (If it falls between 2 and 5), 2019 Kings Pick (If the Lakers Pick is number one or six or lower)  I think this was a great trade for the Sixers. They only had to give up one additional pick to get the guy who was way ahead of everyone on their board and who I feel like is the missing piece to playoff contention if everyone stays healthy. The Celtics on the other hand recouped a pick and can still draft a quality player like Josh Jackson or Jayson Tatum or use the package to trade for a star like PG13 or Jimmy Butler. They seem to think that IT is their future and I think they'll look to resign him. The only thing that bothers me is the logjam they could have at the 3 because of Crowder, Josh Jackson, Jaylen Brown plus they are still rumored to be very much in the hunt for Gordon Hayward. If the Celts trade the package though this logjam could be avoided and they can make a serious push to challenge the Cavs in the East.  Grades: Sixers: A Celtics: B+
eaglesnation11	NBA Lotto Mock Draft 3.0 | BOS- Markelle Fultz   Best player on the board. I don't think the Celtics trade this pick because they realize they need to get younger so when LeBron declines they have the best team possible to take on Kyrie. I think they trade IT at the deadline  LAL- Lonzo Ball   Another obvious pick when one really thinks about it. Lakers have tons of young pieces and Lonzo will hopefully make all of those pieces a whole lot better. Simple as that. although reports are circulating that the Lakers are getting cold feet on Lonzo I feel like these are smokescreens  PHI- Malik Monk   The Sixers reach but get a quality shooter. This isn't the perfect scenario for the Sixers, but they simply have no better choice. This day and age you need a shooter from the outside and Embiid and Simmons can't do that right now.  PHX- Josh Jackson   Best player available at this point. Suns are loaded at guard plus Chriss is going to be a very good player. A two way Small Forward is a solid addition to this team.  SAC- De'Aron Fox   Kings get a piece that will be a part of their core for years to come. Fox is a quick guard that will mesh well with the big men the Kings have on their team  ORL- Dennis Smith Jr.   It feels like the Magic have been irrelevant for a decade even though they went to the Finals 8 years ago. Smith is all over a lot of people's mock drafts, but I feel as though the Magic are ready to move on from Elfrid Payton. Smith may be a surprise rookie of the year candidate.  MIN- Jonathan Isaac   All Minnesota should need is another big to pair with KAT to be successful. Tons of youth on this team they just need to develop. If it they're not playoff bound in two years it means one of their prospects busted (most likely Kris Dunn)  NY- Jayson Tatum   Wow what a steal this would be! The Knicks need a new identity. Phil Jackson should be gone after this year if not sooner. The duo of Kristaps (who will hopefully be happy) and a highly athletic Small Forward that shockingly slipped is a good start to the rebuilding process  DAL- Frank Ntilkina   The Mavs get a Point Guard with a ton of upside. They should find a replacement for Dirk, but I feel as though Frank N is too good of a prospect to pass up.  SAC- OG Anunoby   Kings don't need guards because of Fox and Hield. They have a logjam at bigmen with 3 featured so they draft a guy who can play the 3.  CHA- Donovan Mitchell   Hornets grab a good shooter to pair with Kemba Walker to try and make a run at the playoffs.  DET- Lauri Markanen  Pistons hope to create a solid front court of power and finesse with Drummond and Markanen and hope some prospects develop a little more.  DEN- Harry Giles   Once considered a Top 5 pick Giles has tons of upside and could fill in if the Nuggets lose Gallinari  MIA- Luke Kennard   This guy is streaking up draft boards and he may very well sneak into the lottery.

eaglesnation11	NBA Lotto Mock 2.0 | BOS- Markelle Fultz Best player on the board. I don't think the Celtics trade this pick because they realize they need to get younger so when LeBron declines they have the best team possible to take on Kyrie. I think they trade IT at the deadline  LAL- Lonzo Ball Another obvious pick. Lakers have tons of young pieces and Lonzo will hopefully make all of those pieces a whole lot better. Simple as that. Look for Jordan Clarkson to be traded  SAC- De'Aron Fox  Trade SAC: 3rd overall Pick, 20th overall Pick PHI: 5th overall Pick, 10th overall Pick POR: Jahlil Okafor  Reports are circulating that the Kings are willing to trade 5 and 10 to move up and take Fox. This move makes sense for all 3 teams. The Kings get their Point Guard of the future, Sixers move down when there is no "right choice" at 3 and pick up an additional top 10 pick and the Blazers get to try out Okafor for a year at little cost to them. Great for all teams involved. Certainly the Kings could simply wait until 5 and get their guy but the front office is terrible and I think they will make a panic move.  PHX- Josh Jackson Best player available at this point. Suns are loaded at guard plus Chriss is going to be a very good player. A two way Small Forward is a solid addition to this team.  PHI- Malik Monk Sixers get their shooter. They love Monk, but are hesitant to take him at 3. Taking him at 5 and recouping another top pick is great here.  ORL- Dennis Smith Jr. It feels like the Magic have been irrelevant for a decade even though they went to the Finals 8 years ago. Smith is all over a lot of people's mock drafts, but I feel as though the Magic are ready to move on from Elfrid Payton. Smith may be a surprise rookie of the year candidate.  MIN- Jonathan Isaac All Minnesota should need is another big to pair with KAT to be successful. Tons of youth on this team they just need to develop. If it they're not playoff bound in two years it means one of their prospects busted (most likely Kris Dunn)  NY- Jayson Tatum Wow what a steal this would be! The Knicks need a new identity. Phil Jackson should be gone after this year if not sooner. The duo of Kristaps (who will hopefully be happy) and a highly athletic Small Forward that shockingly slipped is a good start to the rebuilding process  DAL- Lauri Markannen Dallas would like a Point Guard but they also need a replacement for one of the best Power Forwards of all time. What better replacement than someone who plays a lot like Dirk.  PHI- Frank Ntilikina Sixers get their point guard to go along with their shooter here. Frank N has a high ceiling and even though Sam Hinkie is gone he would love this pick as part of "The Process" as everyone continues to develop  CHA- Zach Collins Great fit here. Hornets could benefit from a big and tons of people have Collins as one of their top 8 prospects.  DET- TJ Leaf Pistons hope to create a solid front court with Drummond and Leaf and hope some prospects develop a little more.  DEN- Harry Giles Once considered a Top 5 pick Giles has tons of upside and could fill in if the Nuggets lose Gallinari  MIA- Ivan Rabb Heat get a guy who can play next to Whiteside as they hope their backcourt can develop a little more. 
eaglesnation11	Top 5 best decisions of "the process" (And the 3 worst ones)... | [removed]
eaglesnation11	Do you really think we want him to be a part of our core in 2021?
eaglesnation11	By consistently good I mean good enough to say "This is a guy that can without a doubt be a part of our future core" i.e Odubel had a couple of good seasons but he appears to be no longer a part of our future. Galvis hit for .240 across his career so idk if he would qualify. Cesar though may qualify under my definition tho. Obviously it's baseball and slumps happen to everyone but we produced so many good prospects in the Early-mid 2000s I don't know what happened.
eaglesnation11	Who was the Phillies last consistently good player to come through the farm system? | The whole reason why we suck so bad is because none of our prospects are panning out. JP Crawford is slumping in the minors. So is Aaron Nola in the majors. That being said who was the last consistently good Phillies player to pass through our Farm system? My vote is Cole Hamels way back in 06. Am I missing somebody?
eaglesnation11	Lotto Mock Draft | 1. BOS- Markelle Fultz   Best player on the board. I don't think the Celtics trade this pick because they realize they need to get younger so when LeBron declines they have the best team possible to take on Kyrie. I think they trade IT at the deadline  2. LAL- Lonzo Ball  Another obvious pick. Lakers have tons of young pieces and Lonzo will hopefully make all of those pieces a whole lot better. Simple as that. Look for Jordan Clarkson to be traded  3. PHI- Josh Jackson  Best two way player in the draft. Sixers have habit of taking best overall player. JJ could play the 2 if Simmons is at the 3 or remain at the 3 if Simmons experiments as a Point Guard  4. PHX- Jayson Tatum  Best player available at this point. Suns are loaded at guard plus Chriss is going to be a great player. An athletic wing fits nice here  5. SAC- De'Aron Fox  Kings could always "pull a Kings" and make an awful move but this just makes a whole lot of sense. Quick point guard to pair with Skal and Cauley-Stein and hopefully a great shooter in Buddy makes this team well balanced  6. ORL- Malik Monk  It feels like the Magic have been irrelevant for a decade even though they went to the Finals 8 years ago. Monk is a spark plug that will get some excitement back in Orlando  7. MIN- Jonathan Isaac  All Minnesota should need is another big to pair with KAT to be successful. Tons of youth on this team they just need to develop. If it they're not playoff bound in two years it means one of their prospects busted (most likely Kris Dunn)  8. NY- Dennis Smith Jr.  The Knicks need a new identity. Phil Jackson should be gone after this year if not sooner. The duo of Kristaps (who will hopefully be happy) and a Point Guard that slipped is a good start to the rebuilding process  9. DAL- Lauri Markannen  Dallas would like a Point Guard but they also need a replacement for one of the best Power Forwards of all time. What better replacement than someone who plays a lot like Dirk.  10. SAC- Justin Jackson  Nothing really makes all that much sense here so the Kings reach for a project that they hope could develop into a solid guy at the 3  11. CHA- Zach Collins  Great fit here. Hornets need a big and tons of people have Collins as one of their top 8 prospects.  12- DET- TJ Leaf  Pistons hope to create a solid front court with Drummond and Leaf and hope some prospects develop a little more.  13- DEN- Harry Giles  Once considered a Top 5 pick Giles has tons of upside and could fill in if the Nuggets lose Gallinari   14. MIA- Frank Ntilikina  Best player still on the board. I don't think Goran Dragic is the answer and this Heat team gets their Point Guard of the future

ndmo112196	I’m done | I’m just tired of this life. I want out. I literally have no vision of what the future holds for me. I want to end this now but I’m too anxious as to what will happen to those around me if I end my life now.
l_cannot_draw	What do you do if nothing is enjoyable? | Never been a good writer, but the title sums it up really. What do you do, just on a day to day basis, and in the long term, if literally nothing is enjoyable? I used to (and still do) play video games but now they're just boring and make me angry as im so terrible at them. I used to read about politics and history but now  it just bores me.   I don't like music and I am too bad at sports to play them (I have no friends and at my age there are no amateur sports places really, as I'm too old to be a beginner but too young to be casual about it). I honestly don't remember the last good memory I had, I hate socialising (well I like the idea of it) I hate working I hate studying I hate relaxing I hate (that I can't) read anymore I hate video games I hate sports everything I do is a chore.  Thanks for reading if you did, I am getting therapy and am on medication but none of it has worked yet.  I don't enjoy things i am bad at but I'm bad at everything I've ever tried in my life. I am terrible at video games I've spent thousands of hours in I put hours and hours into my studies and got crap grades I tried musical instruments and sports for years but I was bad at all of them. I don't get how anything CAN be enjoyable when I'm so bad at it all.
l_cannot_draw	What would I ask about my thyroid? I doubt they'd check it without justification. I heard something about it can be linked to mental health stuff but I can't remember the exact condition-is it hyperactive?  I have talked to my doctor a few times about medication, they are lowering my dosages atm but they aren't going to try any others until I'm 18 sadly.  Thanks for your reply :)
l_cannot_draw	Yeah you're completely right, I just don't know what I haven't tried at this point.  
l_cannot_draw	Not really, I mainly just think about my utter hatred for myself. I don't really like doing things I'm bad at, it's not fun to be bad I've always thought. Not really sure how to change my mindset, don't have that much self-control atm.
l_cannot_draw	The Green Party are the furthest left party in the UK with seats, but at the moment they only have 1 (and could realistically never get more than 1-2). In this case a lib-lab or lab-snp alliance would be necessary.
l_cannot_draw	How is the national team doing?
l_cannot_draw	18-0 aggregate vs BATE jesus christ :o  I trust good old Wenger is still manager?
l_cannot_draw	That's fine, really appreciate you sharing these 😊
l_cannot_draw	Thanks as always :). Do they do this for other leagues (Bundes, La Liga, Serie A) too?
l_cannot_draw	Maybe one of the good Dutch teams like Ajax or Feyenoord? They have great youth facilities, there are always plenty of good Dutch regens in the game after all. It's a pretty comfy league so it won't be too stressful, and as long as you don't crash out domestically the board will be pretty patient with progress in Europe.
l_cannot_draw	Where do you think Morecambe will finish this season? They seem to be a team which have been hanging around in League 2 for years with little progression either way, although I do like that their logo has a prawn on it.
l_cannot_draw	Even if not he could always go on /r/soccerstreams.
l_cannot_draw	I've got avast too and it doesn't detect anything for me, works fine in fact :)
l_cannot_draw	I'll do it tomorrow :)
l_cannot_draw	Here is a video of the full match of the day (split into two videos), although the video doesn't load on chrome for me, it's good on firefox. Does it work for you?   The Swansea-Wolves match starts at 17:46. It's funny to see Garry Monk playing for them.  http://www.footballtube.com/videos/england-premier-league-match-of-the-day-28-apr-2012-1-2
l_cannot_draw	I had to update my abode flash player before it worked. If that doesn't work I'll record it and upload it to youtube I guess, since it was a pretty exciting game after all.
l_cannot_draw	I didn't know Mainz even had a second team, I can't think the quality of players is that good. What inspired you to stay there so long, since you can't get promoted and all?  For some reason I really love seeing posts like this, of other people's journey to the top. FM is just such a versatile game no-one ever has the same story.
l_cannot_draw	http://livesportsol.com/full-match/football/crystal-palace-vs-huddersfield-town   This has the first and 2nd halves on it, quality is decent enough. Most of the regular sites have had their versions taken down. It is English commentary.   1 ad popup per half when you click play.
l_cannot_draw	Mariano has been really good so far for Lyon, this could be his breakout year-I don't know a lot about him but he didn't seem to have that bad a record at Madrid either.  How many goals do you think he will get this season? I think he could break 20.
l_cannot_draw	Oh cool I didn't know you could have more than 1 custom database. Thanks :).
l_cannot_draw	Ah I knew about Claasen's megapack but I never knew it added the lower leagues-I have always dreamed of managing in the Spanish 4th division :p.
l_cannot_draw	Awesome, thanks :D
l_cannot_draw	What databases did you use to get so many leagues?
l_cannot_draw	Toulouse as they have a young squad, some good potential and most importantly a purple kit.
l_cannot_draw	Awesome, I've been wanting something like this for ages <3. Thanks :)
l_cannot_draw	It's really hard to find highlights for Ligue un and Liga BBVA in the UK. We have a Bundesliga show on ITV4 but I have no clue how to follow the other 3 big leagues in Europe-/r/footballhighlights only has proper highlights for one or two teams and I cannot find any other websites that do it well either.    Quite annoying, no clue how I am meant to keep up with the other leagues properly.
l_cannot_draw	Did you reply to the wrong comment?
l_cannot_draw	Thanks. This has a lot of MLS too so I might as well start watching that, although not all the Ligue un stuff is up there yet I'm sure it'll be somewhere x-x.
l_cannot_draw	Hm I cannot find any yet for Ligue un this season, will Ligue1official start uploading them in the next week? Thanks though you are right it seems each league has an official channel :).
l_cannot_draw	We all start somewhere :p
l_cannot_draw	Mirror?
l_cannot_draw	Ah that's unfortunate, so be it. Thanks for the quick answer.
l_cannot_draw	Is it possible to install Claasen's league pack and load the new leagues in an already started save?
l_cannot_draw	You can get the league pack and load up the San Marino leagues, but I can't imagine it's very easy to get them into the knockout stages in the first season :p
l_cannot_draw	Is there an active discord (or whatever) for footballmanagergames? I used to love talking to people on that carrot thing but it died and now I am lonely 😭.
l_cannot_draw	Yes I agree, I think the regen potential of a country should be able to change, e.g. USA/China increase over time or if a country has a lot of club success they will produce better regens by metric of more kids getting into it (e.g. if you do well in Europe with Northern Ireland Northern Irish regens become better).
l_cannot_draw	Good stuff, thanks.
l_cannot_draw	I don't think the game simulates inflation at all. That and not simulating emerging countries (African nations, China, USA, India) are the two most unrealistic things about the game IMO.
l_cannot_draw	How has it been going so far? When I was playing in Ireland I found it really hard to break into Europe and just left for greener pastures in the end.
l_cannot_draw	Pulis could grind out a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford with a group of 8-year-olds to be fair.
l_cannot_draw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lng2QFbrXgs  See the thing in the description. Obviously IDK if it works fully but it does for OP. Wish I could have it for PC I want to play as Gabon :(((
l_cannot_draw	Ah ok thanks.
l_cannot_draw	I'm confused. On the page it says:  - New/Updated kits: Sevilla, Bologna (3rd kit), Lazio (Coppa Italia final kit + new sponsor) & Eintracht Frankfurt (DFB Pokal Final Kit ) - New faces added - New gloves added - Updated all managers based on the latest Live Update - Updated accessories for some players, mainly GK   It doesn't say anything about national teams.
l_cannot_draw	That's a really unique save-what's the quality of players like in the dizzy heights of Kiribati? 
l_cannot_draw	I've tried man but I can't find anything. I found a PS4 one on youtube that added all FIFA nations (was 90% completed) but I have it on the PC. It's just all kits
l_cannot_draw	Is there a PC patch that adds the real names of all the national team players? | I cannot find one for PC, only for PS4. Is there also one for PC that adds all the national teams? I saw one with all fifa teams for PS4 which replaces some of the club teams but I've not seen one yet for PC. Thanks.

l_cannot_draw	Fnatic VS Navi-not who you'd expect a year or two ago to be battling for their survival. Navi never should've kicked Zeus when Seized is just right there...  Anyhow, **first half:**  PICS SOON  The initial Fnatic T pistol strat was a neato one where they'd split through underpass and upper mid and have a deep smoke on short to kill off Edward and control mid. From there you'd split mid with the one lurker who's stayed in apps the whole time to prevent the B players from pushing and getting info that they've fully stacked there and push onto B, [however, S1mple was boosted onto site and got a triple, jumping off to hold a crossfire under window with Seized at bench.](http://i.imgur.com/VRE8GGU.png)  Na'vi, on their anti-force, pushed mid through window and hugged the right wall in order, since the CTs have the timing advantage, to take the medium range fight with the pistols pushing mid. Fnatic do often try to push connecter on their ecos so this makes sense, [however Fnatic rushed A](http://i.imgur.com/ZHHdnZK.png) where there was only a passive presence on CT and jungle (because the mid players pushed up wouldn't be able to rotate) so they did get the bomb plant. Again, next round, Fnatic go the bomb plant on B as the Na'vi players fell back into kitchen and Fnatic got the bomb plant without getting a single kill. While Na'vi were 3-0 up coming into the gun round Fnatic had a very good economy as a result of it.  On the first gun round Fnatic took a [quite unorthodox B push](http://i.imgur.com/rt9A09d.png), Seized was alone on B holding up close with Edward pushed up on short (moreso holding mid than B), so Fnatic pretty much got the site for free. Fnatic pushed quite quickly and didn't take a default and used no smokes in their setup, it was quite weird as if Na'vi had two on the site they likely would've won the round, however Seized has always played alone by the van on B so it wasn't exactly a random move from Fnatic. A pro team does their homework.  S1mple was really unique in the Na'vi setup as he was given a great degree of individual freedom with the AWP to pretty much push where he wanted, however this does sometimes leave site players on their own and forced to take more passive setups (e.g. on A Flamie is in CT and S1mple is often playing around mid having to rotate through connector) which, if Fnatic use their grenades wisely, gives them A site for free.  Weirdly on the 2nd buy round (3-1 Navi) Fnatic only smoked off jungle/connecter in their A execute so Flamie had a free line of the site onto the Fnatic attackers.  Usually I would say the weakest part of this setup is B-Edward is pushed so far up mid that even a deep smoke into short would force him out into mid (as if you try and go through the smoke you'll just get sprayed down. Seized played so close in mid that it could work as a weakness if you're not hitting your shots as Seized often doesn't since it'll just give up the site without any chance for rotators to refrag. To my surprise, however, Seized would often actually win the few entry frags and then fall back as they pushed in time for, say, Guardian to rotate from mid and bang them up with the AWP. The rationale for Seized taking the aggressive angle even though he's alone isn't completely stupid, though, and to see why we have to look at Faze. Kio would hold B alone in a way similar to Seized, but he wouldn't hold van to take the early fight but would hold on site, which didn't work as it meant Flipside could just push onto the site through balcony and window without any opposition, wrap around the back of the site and kill him from behind. Seized was taking the right choice in taking the early duel alone, I'll make it clear.  The unfortunate part is that Seized is just not that good, and you really want one of your better players holding B as it's SO important you have the aim to win the opening duels CONSISTENTLY. JW started entrying more with Olof playing a more lurking role and so JW with the awp could take the passive angle and flash himself out and obviously kill Seized, who would usually not be able to get the one tap needed to kill an awper at this level of play.  JW was actually bottom fragging even though he'd gotten some entries since Fnatic just didn't like to focus on B, instead they preferred they'd just leave a lurker playing far back around the underpass stairs to just watch for any aggression from S1mple being S1mple of from Seized trying to get info.  [Na'vi countered Fnatic's exploitation of Seized by having Guardian rotate to B through window really quickly and having Edward on short push further out onto mid to watch upper, and having either S1mple or Flamie in connector to back him up. So Guardian would take the entry kill against JW or whoever in apartments, meanwhile on mid Edward would take the intial fight on mid often against lurker Olofmeister, then fall back a bit more towards B to drag the mid attacker out as he tries to finish the kill at which point the connector player \(usually S1mple\) would peek him and get the kill. Wait for diagram if this is confusing :\).](http://i.imgur.com/pbCSIdB.png)  Fnatic were able to take advantage of Guardian not holding mid as directly by just rushing up it in high numbers and getting the entry onto Edward (or trading if need be) then mollying S1mple out of his advanced position in connector back to window. [When S1mple went to window Fnatic would smoke jungle and smoke Flamie \(or Guardian if he rotates in time\) out of A site \(or force them to push forward into tri-box and die\) and have the site with ease.](http://i.imgur.com/Jd0MSCp.png)  **Half time score 9-6 to Na'vi, which is good for Fnatic who have a very good CT half on this map.**  Navi would get A control very easily since, like Navi, there would be no real aggressive holding from Fnatic in the early rounds with Krimz/Flusha holding alone around tri-box with the other helping JW on mid. Fnatic also held B really passively with Olof holding on short watching the window for the first contact, then Dennis around forest/kitchen who would then push into the site after 1st contact to form not so much a crossfire with Olof but just a situation in which they can refrag each other.  Fnatic would a lot of the time give up their B hold to push into B apps really far. Olof or Dennis would send a deep smoke and push straight away behind it, sometimes with a flash to stop any Na'vi players from pushing through it to challenge. The other B player would then hold at like bench or forest (the pillars since some ppl don't know the callout) to watch short and largely just leave the advanced player to do his own thing, plus if said pusher died it wouldn't leave the B site completely open even if there's no initial refrag.  On A site Krimz would take the early aggressive angle at site/dark with Flusha at tri-box covering him in case Krimz get insta-rekt. Krimz can then, after taking the initial fight, fall back through either the T nades or Flusha's flash/smoke as the latter covers Krimz from any more players pushing out ramp.  [Fnatic's new CT setup in the last 2 paragraphs: ](http://i.imgur.com/xNS6gLW.png) It's got to be said the Na'vi players were not pulling it out individually, they all had like 15 to 16 kills by 15-12 while S1mple alone had 29, though a fair few of S1mple's kills were just bait kills as he was always the last guy alive. Krimz and or Flusha would do the same A push as Dennis/Olof would on B and Na'vi just didn't have the firepower to deal with Fnatic's pressure the whole CT game.   **Final score: Fnatic 16-12 Navi**  **MOTM: S1mple**
l_cannot_draw	Not all communists are MLs to be fair.
l_cannot_draw	Thanks, I'll not be wrong as much in the future.
l_cannot_draw	Yeah I am in the wrong here my bad.
l_cannot_draw	I didn't mean to be rude sorry
l_cannot_draw	Pics soon  Faze won the pistol thanks to an Allu clutch, then Flipside won the anti-eco so the first gun round happened at 3-1 Flipside. The first gun round happened with a [Flipside A take that smoked off jungle, stairs and CT which meant that Allu in CT was forced off of the site and Karrigan couldn't rotate from mid, with the A players being clustered up close due to the smokes being quite "forwards" \(not deep\). and Waylander got the double entry.](http://i.imgur.com/Q0CNss0.png)  Faze Clan eco'd and played by giving up mid and holding close crossfires on short and connecter. Flipside went A from mid and got caught up and almost lost the round, only surviving with 3 players.   [Faze played a mid-heavy setup on CT](http://i.imgur.com/CHGnB79.png) with Niko and Allu playing around connecter (Allu looking mid and Niko A) with Rain playing on A, which could actually be problematic since Rain ends up quite isolated in case of an A/connecter split I'd imagine, but Flipside didn't usually split so it wasn't as much of a threat.   Flipside liked taking [slow mid takes by having early aggression on one of the sites to draw out the short/connecter players then smoking out mid and flooding in.](http://i.imgur.com/fBv0bmu.png) Faze was quite weak to this largely because of how heavy a mid focus they had since it left Rain and Kio on B on their own, so for example if there was a decoy player torwards A then Rain would call for Niko to rotate really quickly as he was scared of giving up the plant quickly which would really weaken mid. TLDR mid players too sensitive because they left the site players too isolated. Blade smart in taking advantage of this.   When Flipside would go for a flat out A take Rain would, instead of commiting to the fight and dying, smoke himself out of the site. As the rest of the A defence was so passive Flipside could therefore take the site quite easily [with Electronic and Waylander on the entry playing aggressively against their own smokes to make sure the Faze players couldn't make any sneaky Dupreeh-huge-play-style pushes through the smoke.](http://i.imgur.com/XliMsZw.png)   Again the whole issue seemed to just be Faze's CT setup of trying to counter Flipside's mid focus by taking the fight to them via Allu and Karrigan on the edges of mid, but Flipside were too smart to just rush straight in and did the aforementioned strategy. It was really enjoyable to see to be honest, it meant Flipside could take all 3 regions of the map and even after the tactical pause at 8-1 Flipside Faze were reluctant to change. They sometimes changed up who went where, like sometimes Kio would go A-close and Karrigan would hold B close, but it's all the same in truth.  The entry fraggers on Flipside-Waylander in particular but electronic too-were just hitting their shots it must be said. Blade was playing a tactical masterclass but it wouldn't work if not for the firepower of the entry fraggers really firing on all cylinders.  Faze, as they have been all tournament, seemed really unwilling to adapt to be honest-I expected so much better than this. On inferno I could accept that sure they weren't good on the map but then against Mouz, who don't really have a particularly experienced IGL, they were pincered so easily on the A site on their CT side and on their T side Mousesports adapted quickly and efficiently any time Faze would get a few rounds. Karrigan wasn't in it nor was any of Faze's star players.  [Right at the end of the half Faze did actually change up their game as Niko pushed aggresively in mid to take advantage of how slow Flipside was,](http://i.imgur.com/B06KNBG.png) meanwhile the AWPer on A (Allu or Karrigan) took the fight early to the bait player on Flipside, meaning that the rest of the setup wouldn't be "displaced" whenever Flipside probed into the other site. The few rounds Faze did win really showed the importance that Waylander had in the setup since whenever he'd lose the opening duel (or just not get the kill) Faze wouldn't get baited into rotating and the whole thing would just fall apart.  Sometimes Flipside would play a mid-heavy default with 3 on mid and 1 playing passively in palace and 1 passive in apps to throw Faze off by taking mid quickly. Niko would sometimes play more directly on A so he couldn't be baited out which left Allu isolated on mid so he could just be shut out.   **The half ended 11-4 to Flipside.** Niko did have a good few rounds at the end where he pushed aggressively which interrupted Flipside during their play setups. He should have done that much earlier on.  On Faze's T pistol they just rushed B whilst Flipside had a standard setup with Waylander on short and electronic at the bench. Faze didn't buy any nades and Waylander played close under the window and so didn't get spotted or smoked off or anything, allowing him to find two kills and still survive, winning the round. [Waylander ended up with a quad after Faze tried to fall back and just play a slow game but GOD Waylander didn't rotate off of B.](http://i.imgur.com/YeYkFlb.png)  Faze made some weird economic decisions, sure it makes sense to force in the 2nd round after not planting on the pistol but then they did some weird half force on the third round where Niko and Allu bought AKs nades and armour when others bought nothing or just a deagle without armour. I guess it was to level their economies but the monies weren't different enough to just throw away a round and force a third non-buy.   Finally at 14-4 there was a buy round. Flipside continued to have a really passive CT setup with one in CT, one in connecter, one on B site, one in window and one rotater between B and mid. This meant that Faze could pretty much take mid and they didn't waste their nades, however Faze couldn't in theory do anything with this mid control. [The fact that Flipside challenged so little on mid, however, allowed for Faze to use smokes/flashes to take the sites via connecter/short whilst Flipside had already used theirs in the early anti-push nades.](http://i.imgur.com/Hn5chTN.png) Flipside's money was quite bad since Faze clan had, to be fair to them, inflicted a fair bit of economic damage during the ecos.   Flipside played more aggresively because a few of them had pistols, taking heavy mid control with two players in connecter and two on short, with one on each able to rotate back to the site when Faze sent out nades. Waylander got a triple with the AWP because of this, he was on short with I think Markeloff when Faze flashed out expecting a player on the main B site, which allowed Waylander to rotate to B through short and destroy them. Also this is a bit forced in there but on CT Markeloff's rotates from short were a bit late which was really good since Faze would often try to wrap around after they'd taken the site, meaning Markeloff could kill the unsuspecting T from behind.  Because Flipside would actually lose so many players each round when Faze did win a round Flipside's economy would be instantly decimated and so from pretty much nothing Faze brought it back to 15-10 just as I could begin to smell the GG, as Babam would say.  [Flipside finally countered the Faze mid-->late nades through connecter setup by having worldedit and electronic hold a close crossfire](http://i.imgur.com/H90AwF4.png) just outside of connecter as they did during the anti-ecos, then having the quick rotators through B since Faze had focused so much on A. This JUST won the round as electronic got a 2v1 clutch.  **Final score 16-10 to Flipside**     **MoTM: Blade (tactics)** Niko and Waylander were also good tho.      
l_cannot_draw	You're right, thanks.
l_cannot_draw	Unorthodox at pro level, expected at silver :p
l_cannot_draw	Ok fair enough I am wrong.
l_cannot_draw	That's not very nice just because I got one thing wrong...
l_cannot_draw	Ok my bad.
l_cannot_draw	Pls explain why I am wrong
l_cannot_draw	Why?
l_cannot_draw	Don't plan on adding pictures because it's really awkward on Nuke as its' double-levelled, but I can try if people want.  **1st round**  Astralis started by pushing outside with the intention of doing an A split. The outside push came first in order to draw the A players apart (so one stays on A site and one covers outside instead of both staying on A site together where they can refrag). Astralis then pushed through squeaky and hut once outside control was secured and then went through vents to B to throw off the rotators from ramp.   Fnatic broke Astralis' anti-eco, then Astralis forced back and pushed outside where Olof was holding passively. By smoking off Olof in Garage they forced him back towards CT where  Astralis pushed in a "see-saw" pattern where they split through garage and around the boxes and peeking in an alternating fashion so Olof constantly had to pivot left and right.  The game was pretty much neck and neck. I had to go for a bit but I  came back at Fnatic 5-4 Astralis when Astralis was on a deco. Astralis continued their quick outside control and the Fnatic outside player would always fall back to hell/CT which, while it did allow Flusha (or whoever was in CT) to flank the Astralis players if they rushed, it also allowed for the Astralis players to potentially sneak by and backstab Olof in ramp, however generally the CT player would be on point. Astralis would actually use the pistol round strat in the gun round as Fnatic would often play quite close up to hut, but still Fnatic (and especially JW) would generally win the opening duels so by the time Astralis fell down vents to B both time and lives were wasted and the ramp players e.g. dennis could rotate in time.   Astralis would rarely push ramp (only when they were able to wrap around through hell) but Dennis was holding there passively by the boxes and so couldn't really be "pinched" since the position is so far back in ramp.  Astralis would USUALLY win the round when they were able to meet up at ramp and push into B, but , eventually, Fnatic began to catch on earlier and rotate to stop the plant, JW obviously using the Mag-7 in the round <3. Astralis tried to place down smokes to stop the early rotators but Fnatic would just flash through them and win the aim duels.  Towards the end of the half Olof would try to push more aggressively up ramp (and sometimes outside) but he really was not on it so he'd leave Flusha and Dennis far apart and isolated on outside and ramp respectively. Olof was supposed to play as the "flex" player going between the two depending on where pressure was applied and if Olof was playing well Astralis never would've been able to link up as Olof would get the entries with Flusha on outside then rotate back into ramp to finish off the remanants with Dennis. JW was making loads of clutch plays and was the best player by far on the server, often making exorberant pushes then flashing himself back in to clutch.  **Half time score Fnatic 10-5 Astralis**  Astralis won the pistol round again on their CT side despite a quad from Dennis as well as the anti-eco rounds. Fnatic set up a wall of smokes on outside with pretty much all their men in the early round, however, because Fnatic committed so much to it KJB was able to push through lobby and get a flank kill, then fall back! Some Fnatic players pushed into A from vents (through secret) and some through A site, but they'd used all their nades in the initial outside push so The Astralis players by vent and on site were able to hold a basic refraggable crossfire with Dupreeh often winning the first duel in the offensive CT position and after winning the first gun round and the related ecoes Astralis evened it out at 10-10.  Even when Fnatic did get control of outside their smokes took so long to land and they also took ages to get past Device in garage/CT that Xyp9x, in particular, would rotate very soon and hold a passive angle on the site so Fnatic would just run straight into his crosshair.   Fnatic countered this by faking B to draw the early rotation from Xypn9x then rushing up vents to A where the other living Astralis player would usually not be pre-aiming the angle and just considering whether to rotate to B with Xyp or not.   The game was still super even throughout the game, and each round largely came down to whether Xyp9x could hold off the Fnatic players in time for Dev1ce and Glaive (who'd usually stay alive) to come down through ramp and secret. Really there was no difference between them tactically-the two teams were evenly matched-however Fnatic were generally hitting their shots more but it doesn't really make much of a difference, and individual flair came out more than any strategical adaptability from Glaive or Flusha.   **Final score 16-14 Astralis**  **MOTM: Dupreeh**
l_cannot_draw	Thanks 
l_cannot_draw	He's always been the worst guy on the team and has always had a replaceable role, Na'vi more than anyone should've understood the importance of THEIR OWN IGL. Even if there were team issues they are professionals making a lot of money for this in a big organisation, it's their responsibility to hire a sports psychologist or whatever to help them through it. Respect your opinion nonetheless even if I do disagree with it.
l_cannot_draw	 **1st half**  Mousesports won the pistol (I wasn't watching as it started super quickly, thank mr.PGL). Also, this is the 1st cobble came of the tournament so far which is neat. Mousesports went on to win all the anti-ecos so the score was 3-0 by the first gun round.  North would play a 2-1-2 with a passive drop hold by Magisk and MSL, with Magisk just outside the drop-arch so he could rotate back into the site to help Cajun if he came under a lot of pressure close at long. Mousesports didn't really play a default but pushed into drop and Magisk found a double. Magisk's opening kills scared Mousesports off and they tried to loop back round to A and died. The role that Magisk played as a "connecting" player between B and drop allowed for neither player to be isolated, and he was really important in the early rounds for securing the B site for North regardless of kills because of this. Often if players are aggressive in drop you end up basically holding 3 sites since you can't refrag drop from long and vice versa. Neither MSL nor Cajun are ever taking a fight alone, but theoretically Mouz could smoke off Magisk and force him to commit one way of the other (drop or B) then go the other way to target the lone player.  Konfig and Aizy would play quite aggressively on A, with Konfig going for the entry while Aizy stayed a few metres back to refrag when Mousesports pushed forward to for the revenge. On the 7th round, however, Aizy for some reason didn't follow Konfig up long so when Konfig got the entry kill ChrisJ could just rush up and refrag whilst Aizy was still meandering in pit. Obviously, you can't just hold in pit so ChrisJ and the long players would flash over from behind while another group would push out of sewer and squash poor young Aizy. Not so much a tactical error as much as Aizy just not doing his role properly and following Konfig.  Even when MSL went onto A the same problem happened that Konfig would be hopping around the place and the other A player would just languish around in sewer. Konfig's aggression would always end up getting himself killed and then the sewers player would get encircled. I also like that Ropz would push really aggresively against the Mouz smokes that were put out to stop B rotators since you can often, since A site is so big and there is so much cover around the armoured truck, just get CTs pushing through the early smokes and making a tight noose around the planter on site if there is no-one holding close as Ropz did.  North tried to make up for the "separation" on A site by Konfig and Aizy just rushing into sewer, getting a kill then hiding in the aggressive smoke they put down, however Mousesports also took fast sewers control since they were used to North playing long more so. Konfig was traded instantly, then Aizy hid in the smoke, however, Ropz waited behind to kill him.    North then won a few rounds back since Mousesports often would kind of overextent themselves on drop and A. MSL with Konfig eventually settled down and MSL would actually play with Konfig, so when Konfig would win the opening duel a Mouz player would run after him and get killed by MSL with no-one there to help him, then Konfig could cover MSL as he fell back ect ect. The only vunverability to this would be if Mouz split through A long and sewer, but they tended to push together and since Magisk/Aizy would rotate fast from drop (the advantage of having 2 drop is that one can afford to rotate quickly to A as solo holding it is perfectly possible) and cover the behind of Konfig and MSL anyhow.  **Half time score: North 8-7 Mouz.**   North won the pistol and then both sides won a force buys so the score on the first buy round was 12-8 North. Mouz forced one round too far and it meant that they didn't have a proper gun round for SO long, really silly call to do so since half the team was stuck on p250s and smokes.  Mouz would pretty much just give up drop and have two on B long. Ropz would play really passively on mid to hear when they dropped/threw nades and to rotate early to A but his role was not to actually challenge the push. North's default was quite a passive one with players bunching up around sewer/A long and in B main (IDK the callout). This meant that Oskar/Dennis on A and ChrisJ on B could push up since they wouldn't face much initial resistance and get in a good angle for the opening duel. Even if they did lose, Ropz could always be relied on to rotate in from mid, which is why Ropz' survival was so important and why he didn't take the fight into drop. When ChrisJ didn't push Ropz would, later on in the half (12-11 North) push into drop a bit and try to actually hold it which suprised North for a few rounds since they were used to being given control of it for free, but Ropz still would fall back quickly so he could rotate around to B/A. Ropz, while he wasn't top fragging, did his role really well and has to be given credit for how accurately he could rotate-Ropz has a great mind for the game for a 17 year old.   North would try and do an interesting smoke execute on A where they kind of split it in half vertically, wood and site split off from the armoured truck and rotate positions. North would then try and split through long to kill the site players and sewer to catch out rotators, however Dennis countered this hard by pushing up and holding close by the sewers doorway and got a double which meant that the rotators from B could push right up against the smokes and although North did temporarily take the site they had no map control BUT the site, which ultimately means you can just get strangled with mollies and nades and such and choked out.  While Ropz never took drop control, North also rarely ever went there despite the opportunities. After North got kicked out of both sites they took early drop control and held it for a time while the other North players set up a smoke execute onto B where they smoked the drop-cross bit, mollied site and chicken and flashed out any potential close players. Ropz late rotates from mid--> B almost earned him the clutch but he lost and it went to overtime.  **Final score 15-15 and North won in overtime 19-15**  Final score:  MoTM: CajunB for winning the CT side single-handedly for North with his rock solid plateau hold.  
l_cannot_draw	Pretty accurate :p
l_cannot_draw	**First half**  [Fnatic lost the first anti-eco](http://i.imgur.com/zV6tT0G.png) after a bad smoke to cover up Snax on forklift allowed for the fork-NBK crossfire, then Taz rotated up to the truck to form a triangle of death with Fnatic stuck in the middle unable to get onto the bombspot to plant as thye had already used up all their nades in the initial take.  VP won their anti-eco and so at the first buy round, it was 3-1 to VP. VP pushed super far up mid with Neo and Taz, and so when[ Fnatic tried to split through boost and garage door](http://i.imgur.com/YxkbPL4.png) to push into mid VP were able to anticipate it and smoke Garage, meaning Dennis had no backup when he pushed through boost and the garage players Dennis + Krimz were blind. Olof and Flusha tried to convene on mid to refrag their teammates but by then Byali and Pasha pushed through and flanked them around T spawn, although Olof did kill Pasha. Fnatic was yet again reset and forced to eco.  Fnatic tried again to do an A take but this time they smoked off Pasha on the awp in quad (and any potential site player) and rushed through forklift, killing the guy there, with the intention of wrapping around onto the site while one other guy pushed through the site/quad smoke to pinch Pasha. [This did not work, however, as Pasha peeked instead of hiding behind quad with the awp and delayed the wrap-around, allowing Snax to rotate to car when Fnatic were still caught out in the open.](http://i.imgur.com/7hQSXdD.png) Eventually Fnatic did hit some nice shots and Krimz ended up winning a tense 1v1 against Taz, however the mistake had still been made (of not smoking off Snax or Pasha) and the economic damage had been done. One round win later of a similar setup where Fnatic pushed Pasha who then fell back around the back of the site crate and got a bunch of kills while Taz was, as he had a lot in the match so far, rotating quickly around from B to truck and reset Fnatic for the third time in 9 rounds.  2 ecos later at 8-2 VP Byali tried some early aggression on A and was punished for it, but Fnatic did not go on to push onto A in the 5v4 but fell back into a very standard default with 1 squeak, 2 main, 1 boosted, 1 garage, 1b.  In the eco before Fnatic had rushed B and found a very passive B setup in which Snax and Byali were caught out completely, [so again Fnatic pushed B and took control of checkers](http://i.imgur.com/9Ck9MI0.png) to push Snax out to CT; fnatic then smoked the rotators off and just rushed the one player on B site (Taz?).   This sort of rush, however, can only last for one round before the B site adapts so Fnatic tried to go back to A and do the same execute that hadn't worked at all before and yet again they were shut down by the NBK/forklift crossfire with Pasha being the best player on the server with the AWP as of the 13th round.  Sure enough, when Fnatic pushed B again, the B players adapted with Snax and Byali both playing close in checkers. Snax got the opening two entries before being smoked off, which Byali used to push through into B main and kill any stragglers pushing into B site proper/staying behind in toxic while Snax danced around the black and white carpet flicking onto the disorientated Fnatic players.  **End of the 1st half: VP 12-3 Fnatic**  VP's T side pistol tactic was to rush B with a smoke to CT while having one player lurk, but Dennis got 3 AMAZING one taps which will definately be on the reddit front page by the time you read this and the whole push fell apart. VP I think wrapped around to headshot too far and should've just gone up the B ramp directly after the CT smoke went out.  Fnatic cleaned up on their anti-ecos and the first gun round happened 12-6 to VP. VP played an A sided default with 2 in ramp 1 in squeaky and 1 in between both with one passive mid/b player. VP did a smoke execute into A, smoking off truck and smoking off cross, [but Dennis and Krimz rotated quickly and Fnatic won the round still. There was one Fnatic player, I think Flusha, at NBK who peeked earlier than VP anticipated, too, to get a double.  ](http://i.imgur.com/Y7AspUq.png)VP would commit themselves to a site early and would put 4 of their players in a "default" or passive position outside the site they want to push into with one player staying in mid to pick off and flankers from A, though in theory in Fnatic were to push it'd still let the A players get a lot of info.  VP took the site into a 3v3 retake after Taz 1g'd and Olof had a good starting retake strategy by just systematically clearing the site with Molotovs, but Fnatic ran out of nades quite quickly so had to push out of CT/upper raw, being vunverable to the crossfire between back of site (which was safe from the Molotovs) and checkers, so [VP won the post-plant situation](http://i.imgur.com/s676El5.png). VP continued some quite 1 dimensional nade takes, nothing worth noting TBH, and for a fair few rounds because VP took such a 'heavy' default as I talked about earlier Fnatic was able to push up in the alternate site and gain info as soon as first contact was made, meaning the rotates from players like Olof and Dennis would be quick enough so that VP would be attacking two fronts.  Byali on the T side was having a good half as the 2nd guy in, as although Snax/Pasha would often lose the entry fight to Fnatic (just because of how good aimers Fnatic are) Byali would always peak out behind a flash or a molly to refrag, taking over from Pasha as the best on the server, with 24 kills.  After a few failed B takes VP set up an A split with Pasha in squeaky and the other 4 through main. Flusha was mollied off on short and JW flashed out, not expecting Pasha to be pushing through squeaky since they'd never split before in the half. [Losses were still heavy as Dennis in Forklift got a spray through the smoke which tagged down a bunch of players, but Byali held the site well from quad.](http://i.imgur.com/polDfnG.png)  Fnatic's few rounds won had all come at a great cost so Fnatic was forced into an eco straight away and made to play for overtime. 15-11 VP.  Fnatic's final buy consisted of just CZs and some mediocre nades and VP set up for an A push with Neo, who'd had a quiet game, lurking on B. Fnatic were forced into some mid aggression (VP never went mid) but Pasha and Taz were far enough back so that they heard the footsteps and caught the rushers in their knickers. From there Byali faked A and pulled out all 3 remaining Fnatic players from B site which was open when VP rotated into it through main, with CT smoked off.   **VP 16-11 Fnatic**  **Man of the Match: Byali**        
l_cannot_draw	I will probably not do as many until the playoffs you're right, just a few a day so I don't get burnt out xd.
l_cannot_draw	 **1st half**  SK started off by doing their traditional B rush and win the pistol round with ease, but then they both break each other on the anti-eco (to use tennis terms). [On A site Astralis had Dupreeh in aps, Glaive by corner and KJB by library](http://i.imgur.com/Y7Od92B.png), so SK threw a deep smoke into long to separate them then rushed Glaive, and flashed through the smoke to kill KJB when his back's turned running away.  [Kjaerbye would when pressured fall back from Library to pit and Dupreeh would fall back from apps to site](http://i.imgur.com/4jpxh0F.png), pretty much abandoning long. Device would rotate quite quickly from B via CT to kill the SK players that went from CT-->B in an attempt to take advantage of Astralis' passive long play. Xypn9x would stay at the back of the site and have a large supply of nades to hold SK off while Device rotated back. Glaive would also hang around B  fluidly depending on how much Device would commit to A or B site.  SK would be able to[ take take A](http://i.imgur.com/mBEmIqt.png) site not only through long but through pushing short since no-one would actually play there directly. Dupreeh would challenge alone from the balcony and die, then KJB would often rotate off into apartments (having already been pushed from long-->pit) and just get smoked off. Fallen had completely anti-stratted just through lightly testing long before committing to short as a group, keeping a player or two pushing around B to keep Device towards B.  Astralis took a tactical pause at 7-1 down.  Not much seemed to change in either of their holds straight away but I suppose used it more as a mental break and did win one round but lost the one straight after. SK did a B execute which pushed the normally coffin-bound Xypn9x into the site and via a smoke as well as smoking CT to stop Device rotating back, meaning SK could then molly the site and push it, and although the B holders made a noble effort Cold ripped their heads off, as is the tradition. Device was missing all his shots again and losing a load of awp duels vs Fallen.   Astralis' A hold decided to completely abandon long and focus on controlling apartments/short so that they couldn't plant A with Dupreeh deep on the site, however, SK would just wrap around long even easier than before and stab KJB and Dev1ce in the back while Dupreeh was Molotov'd off from the rest of his team unable to back them up just a lame duck in the site.  **End of 1st half SK 13-2 Astralis**  Astralis won the pistol and the anti-eco rounds. On the first gun round Astralis played a [really fast push onto A site largely going down short but with one wrapping around long to stop anyone falling back to help the retake](http://i.imgur.com/rXmnDNM.png),  meanwhile, Fallen was on long took the early fight and lost, Taco held at the back of pit and one other player on apartments, but the apps player got flashed deeper into the hallway and Taco got pinched around the pillar. The apps player tried to push back out and died without a kill.  [Astralis continued to play an aggressive default, taking the early banana control and forcing Fer and Felps/Fallen to fall back into the back of the site instead of playing aggresive peeking as they usually do. On A site Astralis would take quick apps control so that Taco could never push into apps to flank 2nd mid. Device was still bad \(bar one quad\)  however Astralis won the first 2 gun rounds, SK 13-7 Astralis. ](http://i.imgur.com/hR2h91Y.png) Astralis did the same A execute as earlier but instead of facing them the A long player, now Cold with the AWP, fell back to help the A player (now Felps) on the site while Taco pushed into apps successfully this time to get the kill, but still ended up having to push out to help his team as Astralis took the site (after several trades) and dying to Dupreeh. [SK won the round because Astralis ran out of time which is pretty funny, but Taco pushing far into appartments was still a tactical error.](http://i.imgur.com/aU0N2B1.png)  In the last couple rounds any semblence of tactics kind of fell apart as SK just pushed really aggressively in apps and challenged Astralis on B on banana, but because Cold and Fer (mainly Cold) were on such fire that it really didn't matter. Cold is the best player in the world, simple as that.  **Final score: SK 16-8 Astralis**  MoTM: Coldzera  TL:DR Device bad, Cold GOD, Astralis have bad A strats on CT side but good T default, however the defecit was too much for them to overcome.  
l_cannot_draw	Usually I get more upvotes than 6 :<
l_cannot_draw	I had a full thing written up for C9-BIG but my internet went out at the end of the match :((   **First half**  Gambit (T) won the pistol and the anti-ecos. On the first gun round [G2 had quite a mid-heavy setup](http://i.imgur.com/KjeK11Y.png) with Apex on short and NBK rotating around short and barrels. Shox and Bodyy did a funky boost on B but Gambit did a mid execute where they mollied sugar cube and sandbags while 2 push through main, but the 3 A/mid players played a fluid setup which meant that NBK and Apex could take the fight to mid then rotate up to main essentially leading to two 2v3 fights in G2's favour (with one lurker staying a bit further behind in main). Apex, in particular, rotated between short/barrels/forklift and held an A crossfire with KennyS which Gambit were unable to pierce.   Apex seemed to be going everywhere and so G2 didn't always play in the same spots, however a general constant was 3 on A with a crossfire between site/NBK and forklift was really effective since even if Gambit smoked off the gap[ one site-side player could rotate around to short if the forklift player came under pressure.](http://i.imgur.com/MUDaIjD.png) KennyS in particular in the NBK area was able to hold the angle and pre-aim the bit where Gambit would push through; KennyS seemed uncounterable because he just had a quicker trigger finger than the Gambit attack.  Since Gambit was struggling for map control so much G2 took advantage of it by taking advanced mid control as NBK was boosted into vents, which also acts in allowing for lower rotate times. Bodyy started off pushed up under boost but fell back to A later. Gambit actually won a round finally, they didn't really do that much different, KennyS just didn't  vary up his game enough and got pre-fired, then short was smoked and Apex flashed out at the same time. [Really it wasn't anything particularly tactical](http://i.imgur.com/2SyEtEe.png); Gambit's timing was just better.  So far in the map Gambit hadn't gone B in a gun round, so as I mentioned before one player, in this case Shox, held boosted into vent/really close to it while the second player, in this case Kenny, was at the back of the site placed there to delay any push in case Shox died early. [Gambit made a surprise attack onto B](http://i.imgur.com/Hgrvzuo.png) after faking a mid push with mollies and Shox was mollied out of the boxes in checkers, then when Kenny was aiming into checkers trying to get the refrag, the main push came from B main and Gambit took the site with ease. Gambit's slow style of default and G2's early 4 rounds meant that they pushed up too far and became overextended, unable to refrag and unwilling to switch up their positions while they were still working. Even when they switched up the sites KennyS in particular just kept overextending with the AWP; he would get the opening kill a lot but then peek a second time and lose the awp duel against Mou.  G2 continue to start off aggressive although it really didn't work, so Gambit, not wanting to take the aim fights vs G2, just sat back as Gambit do in the early rounds until G2 fall back to the sites. Gambit then takes mid control and begins to sneak some lurkers into B main/A main and split when G2 is really compact. G2 seemed unable to stick as a unit on each site as Gambit had some super elaborate molly/smoke setups which prevented any rotators so Gambit would push in a 4 or 5 v 2 with 30 seconds to go and somehow win it every time. If G2 played better crossfires they'd easily win it regardless of rotators since Gambit really were leaving it later than they had any right do. The retakers, once the nades went away, were usually in 2v2s or 3v3s and probably could have won but G2 tended to push individually and either trade or just die and rarely really secured the advantage to push forward with as a team.  **1st half final score: Gambit 10-5 G2**  [G2's pistol round strategy](http://i.imgur.com/UxPlVsz.png) was an A split between highway and main, which relied on the G2 players getting onto the site itself really quickly so they could split coming from behind the site boxes, from barrels and from main/squeaky, however Dosia pushed up in main and challenged the G2 attackers which allowed the other 2 A players to hold a much cleaner crossfire and force the short terrorists into a bottleneck between truck and quad/site (can't remember exactly where). Gambit won largely because of Dosia's cheeky push even though he didn't get THAT many kills because the short players died so quickly so by the time Dosia died Gambit could just push their truck player up to forklift and the site/quad player up to NBK and keep pretty much the same crossfire.  Gambit then won the anti-ecos and the G2 buy round was actually really weak, they faked B then pushed up short quickly to catch out the short rotators and were able to kind of secure the site (since the truck rotator was forced out of the site as well) [but Adren rotated through mid into main once he realised what was going on and got a double or triple spray down with the UMP.](http://i.imgur.com/TklJuUB.png)  Gambit played a very passive CT setup, especially on B, so G2 could actually take the B site for a few rounds by waiting for the Gambit mid player to fall back to a site through a pesky G2 lurker, then splitting through B main and pinching the Checkers player, with the other B player falling back through to CT/upper and playing for the retake.[ Having more players on the retake, however, meant that Gambit would still often have the numerical advantage](http://i.imgur.com/R40Huo6.png) on the retakes and would often win them.  **final score: Gambit 16-6 G2**   MoTM: Adren

l_cannot_draw	**First half**  After winning the pistol [Faze had a fairly standard setup](http://imgur.com/QPadQ57) with rain close to popdog and Niko and Karrigan further back by ivy/A site. You had 2 players on B with Kio playing the advanced position by the ramp and Allu by the back of the site hoping to get an AWP later; until Allu had the awp though he played forwards too sometimes.  Oskar and one other player would usually go ivy and [take an aggressive fi](http://imgur.com/Gfs99ov)ght to put pressure on Karrigan and Niko while ChrisJ would push up A main quite far to try and "lurk" around the fights taking place in ivy, so for example if Karrigan/Niko fall back after a smoke they could fall into ChrisJ if they fall into the site, for example. This worked well since Oskar would almost always win the first fight vs Karrigan (Niko played further back since he may also have to help Rain so can't refrag) then the other player with Oskar baits Niko out and Oskar gets the double, then the ivy player(s) and Chris can push out together and kill Rain on two fronts and they've got the site! As on inferno, Oskar is absolutely THE KEY PLAYER for Mousesports from a tactical as well as a firepower perspective.   Allu moves onto A after Faze lose two buy rounds on it and Kio is alone at the start of the round in an aggressive B position with Rain/Allu playing the flexible position in between the sites.  Obviously, Oskar didn't ALWAYS go to ivy and sometimes[ Mousesports would just rush A with a site smoke and a smoke in between the trains](http://imgur.com/Z1oCCyB) so they could hide in it to push up into the ivy players and to get around the offensive defender in rain. This did, however, leave ivy open so Niko/Karrigan (usually Niko) could push up ivy and flank Mousesports, although such a flank takes a while and the bomb is usually already planted and ticking by the time Niko gets around to A main.  At around 5-3 To Mousesports they also started to go B. Faze rarely had the economy to give Allu the awp (Niko was using it a lot and was getting outdueled by Oskar) so Mousesports just rushed out lower and overwhelmed Kio who was pretty much on his own then Allu would stay back to try and delay the plant but to no avail. Lowel was actually entrying which he doesn't usually do and actually winning a lot of his early fights.  [Niko tried to push ivy](http://imgur.com/2EisCuD) I suppose to just try to get a nice individual flank of Mousesports fairly slow A setups but it didn't work often as Mouz would always have someone holding the ivy angle and it just made stretched out the A hold  even more and usually drew Allu away from B, meaning Kio was alone on B.  [Faze were able to win a few more rounds from 7-3 down by bringing Allu over to A after the early round and playing a lot more aggressively against the Mousesports smokes. Meanwhile, Kio would push a lot more aggressively in B from the moment contact was made at A, forcing Mousesports to push through the smokes before they cleared the site fully so the A players like Karrigan and Rain could just play around the trains and get behind the terrorists. ](http://imgur.com/Z1oCCyB) **End of the 1st half: Mousesports 8-7 Faze**    On the first gun round (10-7 Mouz) Ropz played solo on B around the bomb train and on A site Denis played ivy with Oskar rotating from ivy/site with ChrisJ and Lowel holding passively on A site but not leaving the train area so they can still help ivy and making popdog control pretty pointless for the T side.  [Faze would try to do a fairly spread out A take](http://imgur.com/EbJqmPw) with 2 players sending out smokes for site/connecter and pushing through to take the early fights with train/site players then Niko attempting to push through ivy later while the ivy holders were distracted, then finally the popdog played be able to either push out there or rotate back to main depending on what the needs of the team are. This didn't really work though as Mouse played ivy-heavy so, there was always someone watching for Niko's (or Karrigan's) push on ivy and the Popdog player was made quite useless. There wouldn't be any early pushers from Mouse although Lowel would sometimes hold by the brown train so the two main players would often become isolated from the rest of their teammates so the whole execute would just fall apart.   Oskar moved to help Ropz at B because despite Ropz playing super well and getting a kill each push he played advanced so wouldn't really delay the push for that long which did give away a round or two not really because of Ropz-he has to play advanced or the plant will happen anyway-but just because playing solo B with a rifle is hard. With Oskar playing around upper Faze were forced to diversify their push in both lower and upper which made Ropz' hold not impossible, but still hard and Mous' B hold was entirely reliant on Ropz winning the opening duel, which he didn't always.  At 13-11 to Mousesports [Faze changed their A take up a bit](http://imgur.com/DDSG3u2) by sending Rain/Kio to take drop and push quite fast out of it while using a general awp/smoke execute out of A main. Because you can't see popdog when you're holding from the train this draws ChrisJ and Lowel out into the open and leaves one player alone in ivy. Niko and Karrigan would then push down ivy and take the fight to the lone ivy player who would now have no backup and get the kill on him even if Karrigan was sacrificed in the process. This was a smart move from Karrigan and not the obvious one, it requires a really good knowledge of how Mouz was holding A and he deserves some credit for organising the take. I would've just rushed B and got sprayed down by Ropzmeister, but that's why I'm not a pro player.  Ultimately what allowed Faze to come back was because of this tactical change from Karrigan as well as Ropz not ALWAYS being able to hold up his awesome form on the B site, which is quite understandable tbh since it's not like you can expect a player to get 2-3 kills every time he gets pushed by players like Niko and Rain, although he still deserves a lot of credit for an admirable attempt and he would get a lot of doubles and never let Faze get too healthy an economy even when they won a few rounds in a row. He had fewer kills than Lowel but had a higher impact in  that sense.  **After second half: 15-15, over time.**  **OVERTIME**  As overtime started Faze kept the same A strategy but Mousesports countered this by having Lowel playing by e-box meaning that none of the ivy/train players were pulled out of position by rain's popdog aggression. ChrisJ also played closer to the site in case Lowel died as you can pretty much kill people from all 3 angles of attack from the site, then you still have 2 people by ivy/train and Ropz alone on B (with Oskar rotating around the place).  The issue with the Mouz B hold was that if Oskar lost the awp duel vs Allu/Niko (which to be he hadn't done so much but...) then 2 Faze players could rush out upper and loop around to sandwich Rain. Mousesports had quick rotates from A and Mouzesports had countered Faze again in a fascinating tactical contest between Karrigan and I presume ChrisJ. This game has been one of the most fun in the tournament for sure.  End of 1st half was 18-15 Mouz.  Faze had an aggressive A setup with Rain and Niko by the upper trains and Kio quickly rotating from B but it didn't work as Mousesports split from main and popdog and caught out the rotaters.  **Final score: 19-15 to Mouz.** Man of the Match: Lowel          
l_cannot_draw	Why not?
l_cannot_draw	Yeah I was considering Pasha but then Byali really carried VP through the gun rounds on the T side and pretty and swept up ecos where VP would lose the first couple of entries quite a lot.  Hard choice though.
l_cannot_draw	Ty man I will keep it up :)
l_cannot_draw	I write it out as the match is happening.
l_cannot_draw	I missed the first 5 rounds but oh well.   **1st half**  So from when I tuned in Penta were 5-1 up and seemed to be playing quite an [aggressive default](http://i.imgur.com/1exPRTJ.png) with Sunny taking the early fight on A and Zehn taking the B control with Innocent and one other player rotating into mid later on in the round, pushing the window player out with nades/pressure and pushing up to mid. North don't really take much short/connecter control so this works well as it allows for a fast split (the site they don't go to's players can rotate to mid then get up short/connecter in about 20 seconds). It's quite a smart default and a very flexible one which I prefer over the really mid-heavy one North had yesterday vs Cloud9 that meant that N0thing and Autimatic could just strangle it.  Sometimes when Penta wanted to go faster they'd just go straight fast into mid, but this did leave them open to Konfig on short who usually would get naded off. Penta didn't always did this and sometimes just went for the smoke-rush but it was the general strategy.  Konfig tried to counter this by pushing mid early on (since Penta would typically only play passively on mid before and it actually squeezed Penta into B tunnels since they'd left A alone early as they were planning for a B split.Because of Konfig's push, Penta didn't have the correct nades for a solo B rush and so Magisk cleaned up with a triple with Konfig helping out too. [Konfig continued to push mid with great success](http://i.imgur.com/2nPPeoT.png), something that worked against Cloud9 too and I really like.  On the A site North Cajun and MSL [played on A in a similar way to last time](http://imgur.com/17ww1ug) with MSL close up by firebox/bombspot to take the initial contact, then he falls back into the maze of boxes to drag the Ts out beyond their smokes so Cajun can awp them down. It also meant that MSL could watch connector while Cajun covered apps/ramp.   This initial mid fights would pretty much determine the half and though North were originally able to outplay the window player early on Konfig's pushes turned it around a bit, although Penta were still able to then wrap around to A quite well and won the half.  **End of the 1st half: Penta 8-7 North**  [After rushing A on their pistol round North took quick 4 man mid control on the anti-eco with one going underpass passively. They crawled forward and smoked off connector/window and pushed up B with one late pusher from apps. ](http://imgur.com/wNDZX3x) Unlike last game where they went mid literally every round North was making a few hasty A pushes with jungle/connecter smoked off during the push and taking the fight to the site/CT players since Penta couldn't afford awps yet.   North largely played their mid setup though and Penta kind of played into it by not having a connecter with HS and Zehn other quite far into A site by tri-box and fireboxish, [who would push into ramp/apps when the mid play came out.](http://imgur.com/zBVFeRI)   [Doing an A split pretty much destroyed Penta's setup](http://imgur.com/wLGWUjC) as long as mid-control-->connecter happened quite quickly (Konfig went through underpass and Cajun from upper in about 15 seconds) then the other 3 players would wait for HS and Zehn to into ramp and mow them down with one player pushing out of palace to wrap around.   K0nfig was amazing on T side as well as CT getting 24 kills in 22 rounds, he would be like the second or third guy in and generally still get the entries and then survive and kill the retakers.   HS's counter for this A split was to push apps where the weaker MSL was and take the fight to him so the apps players couldn't plant which let the Penta B players rotate while HS was delaying, but he only did this sometimes since North would be quite sneaky with getting up mid so HS didn't always realise what was happening in time.  Essentially Konfig won it for North and Penta's lack of mid control lost it for them.  **Final score: North 16-9 Penta**  MoTM=Konfig  
l_cannot_draw	I think Fnatic mismanaged their economy throughout the match really-they constantly got reset and so they responded by doing mediocre forces with the CZs and the occasional UMP. That one was certainly the fatal blow but it was just the culmination of a lot of unsuccessful attempts at breaking VPs momentum through upgraded pistols+armour.
l_cannot_draw	Will try to do so tomorrow, fair enough :).
l_cannot_draw	TYTY
l_cannot_draw	No problem man I love it too :).   It reminds me of an old Bulgarian team that came quite suddenly into the tier 2 scene last year called E-frag (later Orbit) which would just force buy tec-9s every single round they lost when the tec was super OP, sure it'd work against teams that took a long time to set up their holds but after a while any decent team would learn to just watch for the rush and spray them down. Once E-frag lost the first buy round or two they just never had the patience to build up to a full buy with AWPS and nades again and would lose because they didn't know when to save and when to try and break their opponent's economy.  I think Pasha was key in the big difference in economic management in the first half as he stayed alive for so long in NBK with the awp, often surviving the full round when getting pushed directly. Fnatic rightly realised Pasha was the biggest threat and he became somewhat of a lightning rod, absorbing all the pressure from the Fnatic pushes (he could take the initial fight then fall back through quad-->behind the red box too) which meant that the VP forklift player could push through/around the smoke and no-one from Fnatic would be watching him as everyone was so focused on Pasha that they'd get shot from behind.
l_cannot_draw	No problem man I appreciate the advice, I can always improve in some way :)
l_cannot_draw	Thanks friend.
l_cannot_draw	Thanks m8 :)
l_cannot_draw	 Nah that's thesolly, a mod at /r/soccer.
l_cannot_draw	I can always do both  ¯//\_(ツ)_/¯
l_cannot_draw	Yeah why?
l_cannot_draw	Yeah, I agree, though I don't blame the analysts for being tired since they had to talk for so long x-x.  Fnatic have ALWAYS played quite heavily on mid on cache for as long as this lineup has been in, back when Olof was good him and Krimz/JW would just flash through any mid smokes and get the entry 99% of the time as Olof was just so amazing. From there you'd get teams too scared to face them on mid so Fnatic would have free choice as to do split through short/vents or sometimes even pushing through CT and pushing a site 3 ways with the CT player holding back a bit to pick off passive site players setting up for the retake. VP's aggression in the early rounds on mid really threw Fnatic off what I think was the area their whole T half was based on, since they are so used to teams trying not to challenge them on mid but instead trying to "cage" them in mid by watching short/CT/checkers from further back, which gives Fnatic a lot more time than VP gave them to set up smokes and general strategy.

l_cannot_draw	Confirmed
l_cannot_draw	Next time I'll just post a meme if it offends you so much : ) )
l_cannot_draw	Thank
l_cannot_draw	I had it all written up but then I had to walk my dogs and it ended while I was out...f only the stream ended on time :(. I've not stopped and I will have the next few matches.

100MilesandRunniNG	Myself | Tonight I just want to get everything out and speak my peace and leave my peace and please can anyone help me  When I was born I lived with my parents and my 5 sisters in a nice part of the world so pretty sweet ride ahead sadly this isn't the case. When I was 2 my dad had a heart attack and died leaving me fatherless and our family broken. Then my sister died from an epileptic seizure leaving my family in pieces but yet we pulled through. Then 6th grade came, I had missed the first the day because I had been away on holidays when I came back everything was awful I had a panic attacks and had to leave the classroom to be put into another room. I had to get help from every teacher that taught in 6th grade and a priest but nothing worked so I was put back into the class and told to "jog on" and was put on Prozac and entered therapy (still both being done today). Here I was diagnosed with depression and aniexty  I went into 7th grade and left for boarding school and it was a woeful experience I was separated from my friends and everything was cold just cold is all I remember. I left the boarding school at Christmas and things seemed better   8th grade came and around September I had my first experience with suicide by cutting my wrists things got worse I gained weight,had no confidence and never left the house it was just awful and I tried to take my life many times by the end of 8th grade I will always remember sitting on the trainwith two guys that I didn't really now asking if I was going to a night out  and I just said no because I didn't have a ticket but the thing was I did but nobody wanted me. That summer I shaved my head for a charity and I went into another downward spiral I received abuse on the street and was all alone and suicidal not two things you want in your life   By 9th grade I began to realise that it doesn't matter how high you are up in the social ladder but as long as you have friends it's ok so I went to a lower group. I began to go out with new people while in school I stuck with a new group of friends  and I went out more talked to girls everything I ever wanted and then got a girlfriend ....  We had booted one guy from our group in January because he went behind another guys back and did what I hate which is try to leave your friends. Then my girlfriend and I broke up in April which was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I found help in her friend  who was my guardian angel but I could never honestly tell I loved her like Romeo loved Juliet. I then finished my exams  and started to hang around with new friends  which was an amazing experience but then I went to a house party two weeks after a night out and I started to chat up the girl who hosted the party  while I was in Greece and when I went out I asked to meet up with me and we made out much to her saying we didn't. Then I got the I see you as a friend text which I didn't mind but what she did after was awful she saw me in town and laughed and pointed at me and I went home to cut again.....  July got worse, one of my Grans friends which I was very close to died and it broke my soul into pieces. August rolled in and this is where shit really hit the fan turns out for me making out with his ex a lad from a really rough area wanted to fight and then aniexty showed it's ugly head again and the panic attacks again. I planned to go to a back to school event but me and a few of the lads bailed so we stayed at my house here I heard the most awful news of my life, one of my friends made out with my ex and I had a breakdown in front of my friends at 3 in the morning it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced it was just soul crushing. Then I went out to a girl I thought I could get closer to, to have a chat about things and she bailed on me for her friends so I went home to cut my wrists again because I honestly think I'm not good enough for anybody    School has started back up and I'm in 10th grade now and a few weeks back I met up with a girl I've had my eye on for a while and I've fallen hard for her I didn't care about her face or all that it was her mind that got me. I was gonna persist with her but she's been dry as the Sahara and just being a bitch so I'm 100% sure now I'm gonna die alone. I've had a breakdown,2 panic attacks and my cousin died from suicide,she hung herself and she was 29 and had a 6 year old girl and was single mum.  But this week has just been awful for me so Wednesday night was a large night out from where I'm from so naturally me and my friends has some alcohol before and we got really drunk so we got  into the club and I said hi to everyone but then I saw my ex and I just erupted I screamed "YOU'VE DRIVEN ME TO SUICIDE I HATE YOU SO MUCH I HOPE YOU DIE IM GONNA KNOCK OUT YOUR LITTLE BUCK TOOTH BROTHER" and I got kicked out of the club after 10 minutes and outside I was held down by bouncers to calm down but as soon as they had their backs turned I ran out in front of a car but I was held back by 5 lads from the estate down the road missing the car by 2 metres. It also turns out that I told the girl i had fallen hard for that was a stuck up pompous bitch and just for the record I'm ashamed of what I did   So I ask you a question is life worth living for me or should I end it all?

FlyMeToUranus	I hate myself | I hate myself, my mind, my body. I think I am fat, ugly and stupid. There is nothing good about me. I am sad and I am angry. When people ask me what's wrong, I get more upset. I am so frustrated I want to hurt myself. I feel like I deserve it. I went of meds and therapy because the pharmaceutical companies kept raising the prices. My family consistently complained that the therapy was too expensive/didn't see the point. I don't know why I feel this way. I keep having breakdowns / freak out moments at work. I think everyone secretly judges me. I just wish I could be normal like everyone else and not feel this way. 
FlyMeToUranus	Cystic stillbirth?
FlyMeToUranus	Our roads are much worse than they used to be. It's the people moving here.
FlyMeToUranus	I have done some cross country trips myself. I stand by my statement. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/rundown/nations-worst-drivers-data-may-hold-answer
FlyMeToUranus	I've had digestive problems for months now. I cut out gluten, but found this bread in my town called "outside the breadbox". I found it at natural grocers. Dunno what part of the world you are in, but that gluten free bread is the the most authentic gluten free bread I've ever had. It's amazing.
FlyMeToUranus	https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers-in-the-us/
FlyMeToUranus	As a native, let me offer my two cents: for years people from many other states and countries have been flooding in to live here. Multiply that number by many-fold over the past few years. Every place in our country has a particular driving style. I always thought the Texans drove rather slow. Californians have a reputation for driving like bats out of hell. Now take all those drivers with their unique driving habits and cram them into one space. The result is hell on the roads. I've been here my whole life. I do believe the whole "Colorado drivers are terrible" idea is misleading. It's all people moving here and trying to retain how they are used to driving. A recent article came out detailing the worst drivers in the US. Colorado was #21. There are a lot of folks out there who probably need to work on their own habits before criticizing ours.  In conclusion: I have been in this state long enough to know it is not the natives who suck at driving. I can't tell you how many times in the past two weeks alone I've nearly been clipped on the highway or cut off on the road by a car with Michigan/California/Washington/Florida/etc license plates.
FlyMeToUranus	Talk to them. Mention how what they are doing is unacceptable. Don't be afraid to get heated, but hold your ground. Talk to your brother about it to. Make sure your parents and their parents know. It's up to everyone to help get it in their heads to stop the behavior. If they won't listen to you, it also helps to have the backing of some figures of authority like your parents or their parents. As a warning, though, some may try to minimize it and use the "boys will be boys" argument. Be prepared to push back. They may be slow to understand taking photos of others, cat calling and forcing physical contact on unsuspecting people is not okay. 
FlyMeToUranus	The worst part is, those instructions still happen today. I've heard of a few modern cases of nurses even holding the baby inside the vaginal canal to prevent its birth until the doctor is present. 
FlyMeToUranus	Was gonna say black vine or strawberry root weevil. Not 100% on the exact species, but it's something like that. I'm not an entomologist or anything... but these little shits keep falling off the ceiling in my apartment (I think they are coming out of the vents). They land everywhere, but mostly in the bathtub and then they die. :/
FlyMeToUranus	My favorite so far 
FlyMeToUranus	I'm glad that it has played out for you. I went to CU and graduated with an BA two years ago. I had a hard time since I did not start at CU Boulder but did all my core credits at UCCS in Colorado Springs. By the time I got to CU, I wanted to do the BFA program, but it required 30 additional credit hours in art classes that would take the place of core credits. Having done all my core credits, I'd have been there for at least another year. I didn't have the money. But I wanted to be a go-getter so I looked at the honors program. From square one the professors emphasized how they could fail us even after the entire semester's worth of work for that thesis and that it would be difficult. I didn't doubt that, but I wanted to do it. They were initially supportive, but somehow it all went sour. They came back later and said they would deny me entrance to the honors program because they thought I was rude (i did not understand. After some discussion, it was revealed that when I spoke to a professor of the program in passing it was taken as rude- that was not my intent at all). Nonetheless, I apologized and did the best I could to show I was sorry and did want to do this program. They were very cold even after that. So much that it bled into my day-to-day classes with them. I was shocked and devastated. I ended up deciding not to do the honors program, but it bothered me so much I sometimes still think about it today. I feel like I left the school ill equipped because of their preference for 4 year students and some bad blood that should not have even happened. I'm a little sad even today. I hope your experience at Boulder is better than mine was. I learned a lot there and am incredibly grateful for my opportunity to learn there and I wish I could go back for a masters, but I still feel a little bitterness and sadness if I think about it. It had meant so much to me to try and excel with their opportunities, but I felt like they were in part denied to me because of the circumstances. Edit: I also studied in the art program and got my BA with an emphasis in painting and drawing. If not much has changed, we likely had the same professors.
FlyMeToUranus	IUD and hair changes? | Hi all, I've had my IUD for about a year and a half now. I had the Skyla inserted last February. I've always had super straight hair, but since I got the IUD my hair has turned wavy in patches. It now has some unmistakeable spiraled locks around the base of my neck, and all around the underside of my hair. It still looks relatively straight on top, but the direction my hair sweeps had changed a bit. I think it's really strange. Anyone else experience this?
FlyMeToUranus	You did the right thing. And remember not to take what happened to him upon yourself. He is responsible for his actions and their consequences. Not you. You did something difficult and the situation was traumatizing and sometimes that can just sit in your head and drive you mad. Don't worry. That can happen. Don't feel bad about feeling the way you do. It's so important to communicate. Just remember that it was his fault for what happened to him. Not you. 
FlyMeToUranus	My mom did this, too. Did not let me stay home from school once. Several weeks of lethargy,  chills, and a heavy, wet cough she took me to the doc to find I had walking pneumonia and mono. Still only missed about 2 cumulative days of school after that.

FlyMeToUranus	Just make sure you keep it clear of any retainers and try not to mess with or bite it and it will go away and perhaps even pop on its own. I've had several of those. 
FlyMeToUranus	I found a worm in the toilet when I woke up and went to use it this morning. Between 4-8 cm long. Red-brown with banded segments, like an earthworm, but I wasn't sure. Was more translucent on the tail end and I could see its dark entrails. I'm sorry the photo isn't better. Could it be parasitic? | 
FlyMeToUranus	I forgot to mention I've just moved into a new apartment. I've only been there a week and a half and we've had a lot of rain. Also, I have not seen anything like this at my previous residence where I have also been checking the toilet after BMs (I have had some gastric issues for about 6 months, but have odd and on for years). Lots of IBS in my family. 
FlyMeToUranus	Update: I forgot I mention I moved to a new apartment two weeks ago! I have not noticed anything while living in my previous residence. It's an older complex and we have had a lot of rain lately. I don't know if that changes anything. 
FlyMeToUranus	I found a worm in the toilet. | 25 yr old female in Colorado. Have not traveled in over a year. I found a worm in the toilet this morning when I got up to use the bathroom. It was between 4-8 cm long. Reddish-brown on one end and somewhat translucent on the other. Banded like an earthworm. Hadn't defecated in that toilet for at least 24 hours (was not home yesterday), but I had urinated in that restroom late last night. I just moved into this apartment two weeks ago. I've also had some digestive issues lately, as in about 6 months or so of inconsistent diarrhea, but I have never seen anything move after a BM. Also had terrible cramps from an ovarian cyst revealed in an ultrasound a few weeks back. Those are also inconsistent and feel like menstrual cramps, not stomach cramps. I don't think this came from me, but I don't know. Is it an earthworm or possibly parasitic? I don't know if I should call apartment maintenance or my doc. I was going to catch it with latex glove and put it in a container, but it got away. Hasn't come back since.

FlyMeToUranus	Found a worm in the toilet | This morning I went to use the toilet and I found a live, regular sized (2 inch?) worm in the bowl. It looked like an earthworm, but I don't know. I've had some digestive issues lately, but I've been really keen on keeping an eye if anything is moving or looks weird, and I haven't seen anything. Also, I haven't defecated in that toilet in over a day (I was not home), so I don't know if I should be calling the apartment maintenance or my doctor. Thoughts? Photos in the comments.
FlyMeToUranus	Colonoscopy at 25 | Hi, I'm a 25 yr old female who has had diarrhea consistently since about February. I did the whole 30 thing in February and it has been getting steadily worse since. Now it's basically every day. It's rare that I have a normal day now. I went to the doc for it and I have since had a blood test (came back normal, but low vit. D). I am going for a food allergy test next week. In the meantime, my doc is now prescribing a colonoscopy. Is this a normal course of action? I haven't done any other tests yet. I haven't done a fecal. I havent even had the allergy test. I know if it's necessary, I will have to do it. But I really don't want to have to get a colonoscopy at 25. Any have any ideas? Should I get a 2nd opinion?
FlyMeToUranus	I would if it was a fake story, but it did happen so I thought I'd share. ;)

FlyMeToUranus	I had seen this image of the world's fattest cat and it was relevant to this conversation I was having at the time about my own cat being ridiculously fat. I was trying to show it to a friend. Needless to say, the results weren't what I'd expected. I laughed at this for a few solid minutes.

FlyMeToUranus	Problems with Skyla IUD | Today I went to my yearly gyno visit and I was told they could not see the strings for my IUD. I am now scheduled to get a pelvic ultrasound next week. Anyone else ever had this issue?  I got my Skyla about 1 1/2 years ago, and it was an awful experience. The cramping during the procedure was awful and I was practically screaming for the doc to stop. And this was the second try. The first try I nearly fainted and they couldn't get the cervix to dilate. Since then it's been nothing but random, severe cramps, inconsistent spotting and periods followed by horrible bloody discharge.  Has anyone out there had this issue? If so, what happened? I don't know what to expect.

FlyMeToUranus	Prozac withdrawal symptoms? | Hey r/askdrugnerds,  I recently reduced my dose of fluoxetine from 60 to 40 mg. I've been taking the same dose for at least 6 years. I have been trying to wean myself off of it by taking the med two days on and then skipping the third day. I've been doing it for about a week and a half now and I've found myself severely irritated and depressed with headaches, occasional dizziness, nausea, tiredness. I also have severe aversions to some strong scents or tastes. They just make me want to puke. My muscle pain is worse and I'm just tired and angry and I feel like crap. Is this a side effect of reducing the drug or something else?

FlyMeToUranus	What the heck, that looks like fish ball and gaint nerd boyfriend. 
FlyMeToUranus	If you are able to, go for a general physical checkup. I have a lot of anxiety myself and have heart palpitations a lot, and my doc has been super helpful. Honestly, I think it would help (especially to ease the mind) to ask a professional. A diet change would also help. I tried improving my diet a few months back by cutting back on sugar and trying to eat more fresh veggies, meats and fruits. I can't even begin to describe how much better I feel mentally and physically. Studies have shown that a better diet can do wonders for your mental health as well as physical health. 
FlyMeToUranus	That really depends. Do you have a lot of ticks in your area? I don't think they usually hang out inside houses, either. I mean, it looks like a bruise, but it would be wise to see someone just in case. Let's say for some weird reason it was a tick: contracting Lyme disease is waaaaayyy worse than a trip to the doc. It screws you for life. Source: my friend has it.
FlyMeToUranus	I had mine at 23 because of tonsilloths and tonsillitis. I was extremely glad that I made the decision in retrospect: the tonsilloths are gone forever and I hated them so much. They were bad and caused sore throats, even though I cleaned often. Unfortunately there are some drawbacks. It was the worst sore throat I've ever had between the 3rd and 7th day. I had a hard time talking for a while because of that. Also, in the 2 years since then half of one has grown back. It's rare, but it can happen. That said, it's very small and does not cause the problems that I used to have. Ultimately, it's up to you. Mine was tough, but I think I'm better off now because of it.

FlyMeToUranus	Heart palpitations and gastric problems | Hi /AskDocs,  I'm a 25 yr old female with OCD and depression. I am 5'2" and rather athletic. Since October I've been noticing heart palpitations that became frequent to many times daily that have since tapered off to maybe a few times a day or every other day. To top things off, I've been having a problem with frequent diarrhea, gas, bloating and occasional abdominal pain for the last few months. I did a "cleanse" in February where I cut out all grains, sugar and dairy, and I have since tried to limit my intake of it, but I have had all kinds of problems since then. Even if I don't eat those foods, I still have digestive problems. I think I've had intermittent gastric troubles for years, but this time it's constant. I've been to my general practice doc about 3 times, each for a different issue and they have either said my stomach problems were "indigestion" and that feeling heart palpitations was caused by my medication. I take 40mg fluoxetine and have done so for 8 years. In October my pharmacy switched the manufacturer and the issues started. My doc switched me back to the original manufacturer's med, but the issues have persisted. I am off to see the doctor again next week and do not know what else to tell him. I'm afraid, to be honest. I'm scared that I'm either just really sick or that this is never going to get better. I feel like no one has taken me seriously. I just want to hear another professional's thoughts on the matter.   Edit:  I got a skyla IUD inserted a little over one year ago. It was an excruciatingly painful procedure that has also made my periods worse and menstrual cramps/lower back pain more intense. Could this also be a factor?

FlyMeToUranus	What is this from?
FlyMeToUranus	I used to take it. I took it for years. I took Prozac and for some reason it made me super flat and without personality.. the buspar helped liven me back up and I'm not sure why. It helped stabilize the Prozac. It worked well, but I kept getting randomly dizzy at times because of it. My vision felt like looking through a camera that was a few frames behind on the action. It wasn't all the time, but it wasn't comfortable when it happened. That's why I ended up going off of it. That might just be me, though. Overall it did help at the time. 
FlyMeToUranus	Yeah, but for the sake of all other students and ourselves we shouldn't just let the dishonest little douches slide through by cheating.... kinda degrades the whole point of being there. In school. To earn a degree. Also, the idiots had it coming to them. Karma's a bitch. 
FlyMeToUranus	please don't go. Please talk with us. Some of us are there or have been there, too. We want to help. I feel the pain, too.

FlyMeToUranus	Russian playground equipment must be very durable.  
FlyMeToUranus	I just want to tell you that no matter what the people in your life say they cannot deny or devalue your feelings or the fact that mental illnesses are a real thing. What you feel is real and valid and your parents can't deny that. I've had some similar issues myself. It took years for my parents to acknowledge it. And today it isn't perfect, but we have made progress. I don't know what insurance or health care looks like there, but if you can make an appointment with your doctor to discuss what you've been feeling so they can recommend a psychiatrist or medication or path of action. I was feeling very similar when I was in high school a few years back. That was my first step. I went to see a psychiatrist who prescribed a medication. It wasn't ideal, but it really helped. If you can't do that, maybe go looking online for a list of psychiatrists or therapists who work nearby you and make an appointment yourself. I don't know what will work best for you, but it's worth a try. Talking to a therapist or anyone, for that matter, will help. Looking on these forums can help, too. Ever since I was little I had issues with depression and OCD, but I wasn't diagnosed until I was 17. My dad usually yelled at me and criticized me, and my mom threatened to take a mental institution if I didn't "shape up", as if I was just misbehaving or something and she wanted to scare me into behaving. I often wished she would take me to a doctor or an institution just so I could get answers or maybe feel okay for once. Look around and try to find someone that you can maybe talk to. It's hard and sometimes looking for a solution doesn't feel like it's going anywhere, but something will come of it. I don't know if this will help, but I hope it does in some way. I feel for you. Sending strength your way.  
FlyMeToUranus	I feel the same exact way. Almost to a T. I was diagnosed with OCD and depression about five years ago. I have a lot of the same issues.  It's worth getting checked out. I don't know if you have done so or not... but if you haven't you should know it really helps you fight it. It helped me feel a lot better. 
FlyMeToUranus	How old is it? It may be too early to tell.   The picture is a little difficult to see, but your beardie appears to be male. Typically, if there are two parallel bumps on the base of the tail perpendicular to the vent, it is male. As dragons mature, the males also tend to develop pronounced femoral pores which are the dots the others are referring to. The female on the other hand has one bump on the base of the tail parallel to the vent. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be 100% certain. You can always have the vet take a look if you take your beardie for a checkup (I recommend this, especially if you recently adopted the beardie. Vets can run a fecal test and do a general checkup to make sure they are parasite-free and in good health. It's a good preventative measure. My beardie came with a bacterial imbalance which gives him chronic diarrhea. Wish I would have known that earlier).   Anyway, I digress.

iamhere4ulifesucks	I want to kill my self | I just don't know what to do I Want to kill my self I hate my mom and my dad and my siblings I am a fucking failure I try to get help but I get shut down every time I do by my mom I have a lot of money in my family I mean a lot and don't say I am lucky or spoiled because having fucking money is a curse i am always singled out a the "rich kid" and soon nobody wants to hangout with me I fucking cry myself to sleep almost every night my younger siblings tease me because I get bad grades i hide in my bathroom during breaks I fucking get in fights with my parents I hate my own fucking reflection I barley remember my name I just don't see a reason to live when I try and do stuff to make me happy I am not allowed to i hate exercise because I am fat and just proves what a failure I am I have a fucking hard time trusting people only people who realate to me (why I am here) but even then people push me away I am always the outcast people leave me behind when it would only take a second to wait I am addicted to electronics and banned from them electronics are the only thing that gives me any real happiness exept for people I can trust please I need help I don't know how much longer I can hold on don't be afraid to message me i will get back as soon as I can

Tmpr001	Depressed because of lack of friends. Lack of friends because of depression. | A way to break the cycle? Medicine?
Tmpr001	Seems like depression if you've been feeling this way for a while. I believe medication and possibly therapy are the most popular treatments.  Although it's possible to control feelings, unlike the symptoms in "physical" diseases, it's only possible to a certain degree. In mental illnesses often this is not sufficient to cure yourself. Just because it's "all in your head" as many people say, it doesn't mean you have control over it.
Tmpr001	r/Incels
Tmpr001	Same, others sometimes seem shallow mentally as they have never been through anything   
Tmpr001	Remember, it's never too late. People put so much emphasis on the things you can do when you're in your 20's but that's just one perspective on life. Everyone is different. Find your own meaning.
Tmpr001	Tip: stop using social media | [removed]
Tmpr001	Hard to say with just this information
Tmpr001	I would recommend Sweden during winter then xD
Tmpr001	What about watching youtube. Doesn't require much input either
Tmpr001	On what occasions did you feel happy? Do everything in your power to do these things
Tmpr001	It's possible to feel empty when you have desires and dreams which are held back by something which you feel like you can't control. After wanting something for so long your mind just gives up and you feel no emotions at all. Could this be the case?
Tmpr001	I'm sorry if it seems I was implying it, not really what I meant
Tmpr001	Have you tried simply going out and being around people? For example, go to the most central part of a city at the busiest hours and just walk around and look at people. I found this was much better than sitting alone in my room.
Tmpr001	Thanks, this comment gave me hope.
Tmpr001	Before being depressed I guess I was ok with it.  In London I was happy but knew that I couldn't live like that forever.  Has anyone else moved somewhere when depressed? Did you eventually manage to find order or did the change just mess with you?
Tmpr001	Awkward position | Hi,  I've been depressed for a year now due to lack of friends (social anxiety). I wanted a fresh start so this summer my family moved to a new city, also because of other reasons.  However, my dad lives in London and I spent most of the summer there with him. I did a routine everyday and had the chance to explore the city on my own which gave me a lot of self-confidence. Also, I'm really close with my dad. For a period of time, I was living for myself.  Today I arrived in the new city where my mom/sister are. When I realized that I was going to live here for the next two years, I basically had a panic attack. It was the fact that every single thing was now different.  There's nothing wrong with the city, but leaving my dad and my routine which I've been following for a month like that feels terrifying. I would literally do anything to live in London, and I don't even care about losing my hobby as an effect. I've been having suicidal thoughts today because the chances of it happening are slim (late school application).  But I know it would be really sad for my mom if I left, especially because the plan has always been for me to live with her and my sister. They really don't understand the way my mind works and, to be honest, neither do I.  What would you do: try to embrace the new city, even though it's the last thing I feel like doing, or attempt to move back to London where I mentally feel safe?  Thank you for reading :)
the-kagamine-twins	Why! 😭
the-kagamine-twins	My depression in one picture | https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4e/49/cc/4e49ccbddbd25ea1de38df58ccfe411d--depression-awareness-depression-recovery.jpg
the-kagamine-twins	Don't be soo hard on yourself!
the-kagamine-twins	Ok 
the-kagamine-twins	Oh 
the-kagamine-twins	That means I'm highly empathetic
the-kagamine-twins	Yea
the-kagamine-twins	What do you mean," highly empathetic people?"
the-kagamine-twins	Yeeeeaaaaa.......
the-kagamine-twins	In middle school
the-kagamine-twins	That's why I'm depressed, I feel worthless and have to put a pretty mask on so no one gets scared
the-kagamine-twins	I actually have acouple friends, but that's not whats bothering me. My mom has a rare cancer, my parents are divorced, my brother is narcissistic, my real dad lives across the country, and my first real friend started laughing when I told her I was going to commit suicide
the-kagamine-twins	I've done the same thing for the last year and I think that ALL of us just need to keep chugging along, hopefully we survive this world
the-kagamine-twins	Thanks
the-kagamine-twins	Sorry this is not my work but I'm working on something like this and when it's done I'll post it
the-kagamine-twins	Understand bro
the-kagamine-twins	BTW shes hiding at the neighbors house, don't go out of the room. When you think it's ok to go over, she's at #36 so rush over there ASAP
the-kagamine-twins	Well, I did have a passion and it was Cross country but I went from having a 7 minute mile to a 10 minute mile because I have a shin splint on both legs. My mother and my friends at school have  had to help me down the stairs for most of the week and that has been getting me down not saying this didn't start before this
the-kagamine-twins	Why, why is the world dragging this on soo long.....……
the-kagamine-twins	Good for you!!
the-kagamine-twins	😊
the-kagamine-twins	Yea NP
the-kagamine-twins	No it's ok, don't cry😊
the-kagamine-twins	Thanks and no problem
the-kagamine-twins	Buckley
the-kagamine-twins	Oh you guys should see our " tacos".Our meat  literally looks like they just took the taco seasoning that was expired with random chunks in it!😖
the-kagamine-twins	Oh ok nevermind this
the-kagamine-twins	Lol
the-kagamine-twins	This is REALLY good!!
the-kagamine-twins	I'll try it out, thanks!
the-kagamine-twins	Love Staedtler! •~•
the-kagamine-twins	Ive used pastel before and it's never looked SOOO good! Amazing job! 
the-kagamine-twins	Oh makes sense now, Thanks!!
the-kagamine-twins	I just finished ryuk, what do you think? | 
the-kagamine-twins	So guys I'm kinda confused on what happened in sand planet, care to explain? | 
the-kagamine-twins	Feathers Across the Seasons (Len and Rin Kagamine) by thisendlessforest | 
the-kagamine-twins	Ohhhh ok, that makes more sense
the-kagamine-twins	The Name of the Sin by thisendlessforrest | 
the-kagamine-twins	This one has the sub bit I'm kinda confused on the story
the-kagamine-twins	This is really good!!
the-kagamine-twins	Kawaii!!
the-kagamine-twins	Lol!Maybe Batman has an obsession with strawberry cake!!
the-kagamine-twins	Another plot twist - what if L is Batman and Alfred is Watari? Lol
the-kagamine-twins	Can someone make this larger and cut off the black part? ( send it to me when you're done) | 
the-kagamine-twins	Oh ok
the-kagamine-twins	Thank you!!!😊
the-kagamine-twins	Drew this a little bit ago,what do you guys think?? | 
the-kagamine-twins	I think it's the hair color too, it's usually more navy
the-kagamine-twins	Well I think it makes more sense having it small because that was the whole idea of reusing paper and riping it out of the notebook because it still has the same effect. AND it was EXTREMELY easy to hide because of its size. It's either in the first or second episode that he hides it in the drawer with the key and everything. That wouldn't have worked with a deathnote that thick. 
the-kagamine-twins	There also like," blah blah don't kill her" it gets annoying after awhile
the-kagamine-twins	That it doesn't need to be in the book to kill someone???
the-kagamine-twins	I havent watched the movie but wasn't the whole anime kinda wrapped around that one detail???
the-kagamine-twins	KEY WORD,MOST! Not ALL of the people in the movie were jerks
the-kagamine-twins	Well, I'm not saying to throw away all your friends, of course you want friends during this period because it's a social skill to be comfortable around a lot of people. Just be able to balance school and friends. I would say the only way school is fun is when you got people going with you!!😁
the-kagamine-twins	NEVER EVER IN YOUR ENTIRE YEARS OF MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD YOU EVER WASTE TIME IN THE HALLS BETWEEN CLASSES!!! If you just start talking to a person during that time period, before you know it you'll be tardy. AND if you're not late for class, you probably forgot an important thing for class such as a textbook or notebook!!
the-kagamine-twins	I going to start reading the manga but in the anime, ah when yuzuru brought the video to Ishida and they played it...... Wanted to literally slap ueno and hug nishmiya and tell her it's ok
StellaZaFella	Being all over the place, wanting it to stop | I have bipolar disorder and have been hypomanic for the last few days.   I don't have insurance, so I can't afford medication or a doctor's visit.   I can't seem to calm myself down. My mind is racing, I can't focus on anything.   I hate this feeling and being stuck with this disorder. It's not helping my suicidal ideation. I feel completely out of control. 
StellaZaFella	I don't switch. I've lost my will to live and have no feeling for anything. 
StellaZaFella	What can I do about hopelessness? | I think my biggest problem is that I can't find a single thing to be hopeful about.   The experience I have of life is that I will never have anything I care about or work for. I will fail and lose out on everything.   All I ever wanted was to be cared about. No one cares.   I need help, but no one listens.   Life is impossible without hope, but there's no reason for me to hope. Hope has been useless. Nothing I ever wished for, wanted, or hoped for ever came to pass. 
StellaZaFella	I don't care about anything. I've already lost out on everything in life. 
StellaZaFella	I've been depressed for about ten years.   I don't have any friends/don't get along with family. I'm completely alone.   I'm not going to finish college.   I haven't been able to get a job. 
StellaZaFella	Today Wasn't different | Last night I wrote a post about how I wanted today to be different--how I wanted to actually do things and not be miserable.   It was the same sort of day I've had for the last ten years.   I hate my life and can't get out. 
StellaZaFella	I need things to be better now | I've been suffering for ten years.   My life is absolute shit, no matter what I do.   I'm broken down by it. I can't try any more.   I need a miracle, for some good thing to happen to me.   But it never does. 
StellaZaFella	Wouldn't that be too risky? What would stop Ally from shooting the clowns? 
StellaZaFella	I want tomorrow to be different | Since April I've been severely depressed. In the last month I've had a horrible problem getting out of bed. Most days I just spend sleeping--I take sleeping pills throughout the day just to keep myself sedated.   I have a lot of work I need to do to finish college, and I have basically given up on it.   I don't have any sort of motivation. I can't get myself to do the work. I feel I'm going to fail anyway, so why bother?  But I don't want this to be my life. I want to have productive days and achieve things and get out of this hell I've lived for the past ten years of depression.   I don't know what I can do to change things. 
StellaZaFella	I think I found the right people, the problem is that there are a lot of circumstances in my life that aren't changing that are making things difficult. 
StellaZaFella	I don't have insurance, so therapy is out. I had been going for about five years, but it didn't help much. 
StellaZaFella	Where Can I get Robbie Turner's Book? | On her Hey Qween interview four months ago (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1z9_Piux4) Robbie mentioned writing a book--I'll Tell You for Free-- and had a copy with him. They said it would be out by the time the episode aired, but I haven't been able to find it anywhere--no Amazon, Barnes and Noble, not even Robbie's website.   Has anyone been able to find this?  
StellaZaFella	That's odd...I was under the impression that the book had already been printed since Johnny had a copy during the interview (and is seems like he had possibly read parts of it to prepare for the show).  Thanks! 
StellaZaFella	I have the same problems. I live with my mom, who has a variety of health issues. I'm too scared to drive too. I don't even have a license. 
StellaZaFella	25.   Please don't say I have life ahead of me. I've been miserable and alone for 25 years. It has damaged me beyond repair. 
StellaZaFella	I'm miserable and without hope | Every waking minute for me is agony. I am completely alone.   I have no job, I can't finish college, I have nothing.   I don't want to live.   I can't get myself to feel good enough to improve my life. Nothing I try works.   I don't know what to do when I have no hope of things changing. Experience has taught me that life only gets worse for me.   I'm a complete fuckup. I have nothing and no one and I need help and support and love and can't get it. 
StellaZaFella	That's nice for you, but I don't have any miraculous person coming into my life. 
StellaZaFella	I don't get the draw with these things. To me their fucking ugly.   I wouldn't want a dead-eyed, hydrocephailc, cartoony representation of anything. Why not normal action figures or dolls?
StellaZaFella	I agree. I skip the first ten minutes of every Hey Queen to get to the interview portion.   It's really irritating in every Look at Huh how he does his "who is she...?". Could he just look at the photos beforehand and help out with who they are instead of him and the guest guessing or waiting for someone else on set to let them know? 
StellaZaFella	I'm going through a serious bout of depression. I find it almost impossible to get out of bed. I haven't been able to do anything I need to do for school and am falling more and more behind each day.   I don't have insurance/can't afford therapy or medications.   My life is totally empty. I have no friends and don't get along with my family.   I don't see any light or the possibility of good in my life. 
StellaZaFella	How do I get myself to get out of bed in the morning? | I've been severely depressed since April. I attempted suicide on April 29th.   I have five college classes to finish work for--they are incomplete classes from a few previous terms. I don't have to go to classes, I just have papers to write.   I haven't made any progress in May, June, July, August or the days into September. I have until November 1st to do the work.   I've been paralyzed, especially in the last month. I spend most of the day in bed. When I'm not in bed/sleeping, all I do is stare into space and worry about what a mess my life is/how much I don't want to live.   I don't have insurance, so there's no professional help available or medication. I don't get along with my family and don't have any friends, so there's no one I can talk to.   I'm completely empty. I have no desire to live or motivation to work. I don't care about doing the work, I don't have a sense of obligation to get it done or anything. I can't conjure a sense of urgency to do it or create rewards or consequences for myself. Everything is just awful.   I don't know what to do to get myself to care about this work or want to live or anything. Every time I go to sleep I hope I hope I don't wake up. 
StellaZaFella	I'm not feeling this. A child fantasy seems inappropriate. 
StellaZaFella	Trixie doesn't look like Trixie with this makeup. Maybe it's too toned done/muted. 
StellaZaFella	I would love a fashion selfie with one of Fame's show chickens. 
StellaZaFella	Agreed. The term "baby slut" on a person who is dressed and in an environment (boot) Decorated like an actual baby's nursery is disturbing.
StellaZaFella	She did. This outfit is also the outfit in the Morgan cemetery illustration. I'm not wild about it.   Maybe since she's embracing a new aesthetic she doesn't have much variety in her wardrobe yet. 
StellaZaFella	I appreciate the offer, but I meant would it be ok to reach out to someone in my own life at this time of night on a Friday? 
StellaZaFella	Would this be okay? | I have pretty severe anxiety and depression. I'm having a particularly bad night and want to talk to someone.   But I don't want to bother anyone.   Would it be okay to start conversation with someone now? It's about 8:45pm. Is that too late? Would I be intruding?   I feel like most people my age (mid twenties) would be doing something on a Friday night. 
StellaZaFella	How do I feel better enough to do something? | Since April I've been spiraling downward. I have to finish some classes by November, but I'm paralyzed by depression. I don't have insurance, so I can't afford therapy or medication.   My days are completely empty. I spend most of my time in bed. I take sleeping pills throughout the day to sleep away my time.   I just can't get motivated or interested in what I have to do. I feel like it's a lost cause at this point, that I'll never get my work done.   I have no friends.   I don't want to live. 
StellaZaFella	Has anyone successfully used career services? | I'm a senior who will (hopefully) graduate in December and I want to know if career services has helped anyone find a job.   I'll have an English Literature degree. I know that really limits my options. I've been looking for work since April and haven't had any luck on my own. 
StellaZaFella	Ignored when I reach out | About a week ago, when I was really desperate, I posted about my mental health problems on social media. I didn't get many responses--a couple of "hang in theres", "good vibes" sort of stuff.   One person who responded was a former classmate. She asked if she could help and I told her I could use someone to talk to. She said I could reach out to her any time. It was late that night, so I sent her a message in the morning.   The conversation was brief. I felt worse afterward. I really needed to talk to someone and she offered. I thought she would actually listen and be there.   I tried reaching out to her again last night, giving her an update on the things we talked about last week. It's been a whole day and she never opened the message, but she's been on social media multiple times since.   I found out yesterday that she was actually in the same city. It hurt a lot to learn she was here and didn't reach out since she's aware of how isolated I am and that I'm going through a hard time.   It's really painful to have been given hope that this person cares/wants to help me and then have her actively avoid me. I don't know what I did wrong--I don't think I put too much of my problems on her in that initial conversation.   It would help me a lot to have her to talk to, but she seems over it/not interested. I don't know how to fix or if I should try again with her. 
StellaZaFella	What do you do when you have no will to live? | I haven't wanted to live for a long time. I don't know if I ever consciously chose life. I'm alive because I have to be--I take care of my mom who has a lot of health problems.   I have no dreams or desires because I know from experience that I'll never achieve or obtain anything good.   I don't want to live, but I have to. I don't want to feel the way I do anymore, but this feeling never goes away. I don't know how to make myself fight for life when I don't want it. I don't know how to improve things when I have no desire for anything. I've even let go of wanting to feel better because I never do. 
StellaZaFella	At this point, not really since all the people in my real life who have ended up abandoning me. 
StellaZaFella	I'm tired of being abandoned by people. 
StellaZaFella	Is there nothing I can do?   Of course not.   I just don't get why she would offer help and then abandon me.   I reached out because I have no options. No friends. 
StellaZaFella	It hurts a lot to lose her from my life. She is a kind, positive, compassionate person. I want it to work. She's the only person who said I could talk to her. I have no one else. 
StellaZaFella	Do you know how to make it better with people? Have them care? 
StellaZaFella	No, not really. I think I feel worse that she offered help and didn't follow through than if she had never said anything.   It makes me feel totally worthless for someone who knows I need help to consciously decide not to interact with me when I've directly reached out to her. 
StellaZaFella	No, we've been in contact since March. 
StellaZaFella	About two years. 
StellaZaFella	They look like Skittles. 
StellaZaFella	Insult to injury | Last week, in a moment of severe pain, I posted on social media about how hard life has been for me lately.   A couple of people responded with general messages of support-hang in there, sorry to hear this.   One person who responded was a former classmate of mine. She's really nice and we got along well. She asked how she could help and I said that I could use someone to talk to. She said I could message her any time.   It was late that night, so I wrote to her the following morning. The conversation was disappointing. I let her know some of the problems I've been having and she just seemed to not be listening. She was like everyone else, just saying hang in there.   It hurt. I felt like I was wasting her time. I don't now why she offered to talk to me when she didn't care. We only ended up exchanging a few messages until she dropped out of the conversation.   That was last week. Today I reached out to her again to let her know how things were going--I had taken some steps during the week to work on some of the problems that I had. She didn't respond.   Later I found out that she had been in the same city as me today. I feel very hurt that she was here and never mentioned it/didn't reach out or make plans when she knows I'm having a hard time and I don't have anyone around me.   She's the only person I have to talk to and she doesn't want to talk to me.   I know a professional would be better, but I don't have the money for that. And I need someone to talk to in general, not just about mental health things. I don't have any friends. She's the closest thing to it. She is nice and caring, but I just don't matter to her.   I don't want to live. This experience is the last disappointment I could take. I know I'm worthless, but this tenuous connection was the only bit of hope I had left. Maybe if I could have had a conversation with somebody, the pain would have alleviated a little. I'll always be alone and I can't deal with that pain anymore. 
StellaZaFella	Jasmine's Patti Labell pie vlog is a go to for laughs.
StellaZaFella	Hair and Makeup Emmy question | [removed]
StellaZaFella	She does. She looks like early/young Madonna, especially in the eyes. I think the problem is that Madonna's face has aged/been surgically altered and Venus hasn't or can't or doesn't want to keep up with those changes.  
StellaZaFella	What does "those shoulders should match them hips mean? | [removed]
StellaZaFella	My ID expires in September. Should I get a new one? 
StellaZaFella	What happens if I don't enroll in the Fall term? | I was planning on taking a class this term, but it turns out I can't afford it. I'll have to wait until spring.   Problem is, I have to finish the work for a class I didn't finish in the spring, so I still need to use the library to take out books and access articles online.   What happens to my access to the library/my student account if I don't enroll in a class for the fall? Will I be able to take a class in the spring without a problem or would to reapply and everything?   I've asked my English department advisor, but she's not sure. I've called the library and they said I would lose access, but I could purchase an alumni membership, but this confuses me a little--I just one to take off a single term, but drop out as student. 
StellaZaFella	Thank you, this is helpful.   Can I take out books from the library still?   Will I still have access to courseweb? How would I enroll in a class for the next semester? Would I still have access to the Student Center? 
greenbird27314	Failed attempt | I can't decide if my blade wasn't sharp enough, or if a part of me really didn't want to do it. Either way, I barely cut deep down enough to leave a scar. Or 5 scars. I tried quite a few times. 
greenbird27314	I have been depressed my whole life. My mom tells me stories of when I was a baby, and she could tell that something was wrong with me emotionally. Both of my parents knew, but they never cared to get me help. I finally got on meds about a year ago because I started thinking about cutting again, and the suicidal ideations got too much to bare.   I love my job. My job is the only reason I am still alive. I am a teacher, and I love my kids. They need me. That is what keeps me from doing it sometimes. Knowing that they wouldn't have anyone if I died.   It just sucks that I am there for everyone, and no one is there for me. A lot of people love me, but only because of what I do for them. No one genuinely cares about me. 
greenbird27314	I am 33 and still waiting for it to get better. | 
greenbird27314	I know my students care about me, but they care about how I help them. None of them want to help me through my own shit, and even if they did, it would be inappropriate for me to ask them to. I have tried to talk to my family members, besides my mom agreeing that I need to get on meds, that is all the support I got. My mom knows that I cut on occasion, but she doesn't care enough to say something to me about it. My best friend is the only one that has ever truly cared, but our friendship has always been really rocky.   I am the same way. I typically don't like talking about my problems, but it is so hard to not only bare the weight of my problems, but also everyone else's, since so many people come to me with their's. 
greenbird27314	The razor blade is ready | The only thing stopping me right now is the fear that it won't work, and I will be left with scars, yet again, that I will have to try to keep covered up as the new school year starts up. I am sure having a teacher with obvious suicide bandages on her wrist would give the students great confidence in her at the beginning of the school year. 
greenbird27314	My mom knows, but she doesn't like talking about it. I have tried to talk to my dad, but he seems to think nothing is wrong with me. My sister told me I could always talk to her, but every time I try, she won't get off of her phone. My doctor was the first doctor I have ever had that I felt discussing it with, and she just recently moved, so it will take awhile before I feel comfortable talking to someone else. 
greenbird27314	I don't have the time or the money. My insurance won't cover it. My doctor didn't seem to think I needed it. Even after I told her that I have ideations. She seemed to think that medication would work, but I don't think it has. 
greenbird27314	Yep. A few people know I am suicidal. The ones that seemed to really care. They don't. Story of all of our lives, right? Isn't that why we post here? Because we have no one else. 
greenbird27314	Yes. My feelings exactly. I always think the worst possible thing will happen, then I comfort myself knowing that, if it does, I can just kill myself to make it all go away. 
greenbird27314	As a depressed teacher, I do understand this, but I will give you my thoughts on this. I deal with depression and anxiety daily. Very few people know. My best friend knows about my depression. Close family and a few coworkers know about my anxiety. I have a job I am required to do. I have deadlines. Grades have to be in. Parents have to be emailed. Meetings have to be had. I cannot use my anxiety or depression as an excuse to not do my job. I would be fired if I did. I talk to my students about this as well when I can tell they are struggling. Sometimes, I honestly consider telling them I am dealing with similar issues, but I don't like people knowing. You have to learn coping skills, and you have to keep up with your responsibilities. It is better to try to figure it out in high school with assignments than it is as an adult with bills.
greenbird27314	Not at all ranty. There are definitely teachers that have zero understanding, and it sucks. I do not condone all of my colleagues' behavior towards students. It goes both ways. Some teachers need to be more understanding. Some students need to learn how to push through and not use it as an excuse. Either way, any teacher should be the type of person that a student should feel comfortable talking to if they are having issues. That way, they can work through it together. 
greenbird27314	People's reaction to this scene always bothered me. Yes, it was overdramatic and a little on the silly side, but there is so much more going on here that people never seem to focus on. This was so profound to me in so many ways, and it bothers me that people treat it as a joke. 
greenbird27314	Solution | Sometimes, the only thing that helps me sleep is the knowledge that, if tomorrow goes the way I imagine it will, I can end it all. If that bad thing happens. If everyone turns against me. If me doing what is right ends up going wrong, I can just go home and never come back. Fuck the people that care. They never have my back when I need it anyway. 
greenbird27314	Reason 1: I am too scared that it will go wrong, and I will still be alive, but have issues.   Reason 2: Knowing how many students need me in their lives. They tell me all of the time that they need me. It just sucks that no one wants to be there for me when I need someone. 
greenbird27314	When I was in middle school, I was walking home one day after school. This man drove by and asked if I wanted a ride home. I refused. He was very persistent, but I continued to refuse. He drove off. A few minutes later, I saw him driving back the other direction. I always wonder what would have happened if I got in his truck. I am guessing nothing good. 
greenbird27314	I can't tell you how many times I have worried that something like this would happen to me as a teacher. It is nice to know that I won't be alone if it ever does. 
greenbird27314	Because suicidal people in some cases are that way because they feel too much which means they care too much. The world would be better with people like them in it than people like you who seem to think it is okay to just let people die. 
greenbird27314	My chow had been attacked several times. Once by a dog I tried to adopt, and several times by a dog I got, but didn't know she had aggression issues until she was older. My chow never started a fight. She got to a point with her little sister that she would stand her ground when bullied, because she was tired of being attacked. They would get in pretty bad fights. Blood every where. I ended up putting my other dog on prozac for awhile to help calm her down. When I brought her in, the vet kept asking about my chow. "Are you sure she hasn't been starting them?" Yes, I was sure. Most of the time, she was laying there minding her own business, and my other dog would just walk up and attack her. She fought back, but she never started it. Every dog is different, but from my experience, getting in a fight didn't change my chow. She was still my little sweetheart. 
greenbird27314	That is exactly how I feel. Guilty for worrying, because you don't feel your worries are valid. Death is the answer, but I don't have the courage to just do it. 
greenbird27314	Visiting Memphis | I am going to be visiting Memphis by myself in a few weeks, and I was hoping people could give me some ideas on things I must see and places I must eat. I am a vegetarian, so I would love some good vegetarian cuisines. 
greenbird27314	I love this. I have been teaching for 10 years, and I did lose my sense of "changing the world" for a few years, but I found it again. I encourage all new teachers to never lose it. I remember veteran teachers laughing at my naiveté when I first started, it makes me sad that they lost it. I hope to never lose it again.  
greenbird27314	People who say "it gets better" don't really know what depression is | I just read yet another "it gets better" article trying to convince teenagers to not commit suicide. I never tell that lie. I never say "it gets better". I say "you need to learn how to fight through it". People that think that it gets better do not know what true depression is. They might have had a shitty thing happen to them where they thought for one moment that they didn't want to live any more, but they don't know what it means to live a life of feeling that way. They don't know what it is to lay awake at night, wandering why you can't sleep, and why you are drowning again, when you have been doing so well, only to realize you forgot to take your meds the past couple of days. They will never know what it feels like to accept that this is your life. You will forever be fighting it. You will pray for God to give you peace of mind, and the only way he can give it to you is through a pill that still fails you sometimes. It is tough knowing that some people will never understand. 
greenbird27314	Not any proof I am willing to share, since I would like to stay anonymous on reddit. Only one person in my life knows the struggles I deal with, and I would like to keep it that way. 
greenbird27314	I am a high school teacher that several students feel comfortable  talking to about all of their problems. Please feel free to contact me. 
greenbird27314	In 3rd grade, all of my classmates were making fun of another kid for still believing in Santa. I haven't ever told anyone that was the moment I realized he wasn't real.
greenbird27314	I used to get bloody noses all of the time. They would last awhile. I would always know it was almost done when a huge bloody booger like thing would come out of my nose.   I eventually out grew them, thank the Lord. Almost daily as a little kid became monthly as a teenager. Now, I never get them any more. 
greenbird27314	...doesn't sing along with the radio. It is inhuman. 
greenbird27314	Same here. For some of us, depression isn't a switch that was flipped because of something. It is the way our brains are wired. My dad told me he could tell something was different about me since I was really young. Neither of my parents ever cared enough to take me to a doctor. I finally took it upon myself about a week ago to finally get on medication at the age of 33. 
greenbird27314	I am always here to talk, if you need me. PM me if you want. 
greenbird27314	This sounds very similar to ways that I have felt in the past. Feel free to message me if you want to talk. 
greenbird27314	I am always here to listen. My students always find comfort in talking to me. PM me if you need to. 
greenbird27314	I have had this conversation with many students. People that don't have depression, will never understand. They can try to love, but they will never understand. You just have to find someone that is willing to be there for you, even when you have those moments where you can't handle the world. Even if it seems there was nothing that triggered it. I haven't found that person yet. I am losing hope. 
greenbird27314	I just started on Lexapro today. My doctor also gave me Buspirone while I am waiting for the Lexapro to kick in. She said it will help more immediately when I start having an anxiety attack. She couldn't tell if I had depression and anxiety, depression that leads to anxiety, or anxiety that leads to depression. Is there anything you can tell me about your experiences with Lexparo that might help me out? Feel free to PM me. 
greenbird27314	I am a teacher. We discussed this in a faculty meeting once. A counselor told us that it is hard for us to understand these kids with these thoughts, because we don't have them ourselves. She was making suggestions on how to deal with them without understanding it. I was just sitting there, completely shocked. I had no fucking clue that there were actually people that did not ever imagine killing themselves. It also made sense to me at that moment why I counseled so many kids instead of their counselors. They don't realize it, but I am the only one there that understands them. 
greenbird27314	Wow. I thought I was the only one. My life is constant highs and lows. Not in a bipolar way. I know what causes the lows, and I know what causes the highs. Only one person sees the lows, and I worry so much that they think it is all on act. I worry they think I just want their attention. They don't see my scars though. They don't know how deep the depression is. No one else sees it. They just see the highs and think I am strong and have my shit together. 
greenbird27314	I hope your doctor can help you out. I made the decision over the weekend to talk to my doctor about some sort of anxiety medication, because I feel that is where my suicidal thoughts stem from. My doctor might have other thoughts, and I will take whatever suggestions they have to not make me feel like this. I hope you do the same. 
greenbird27314	The main thing I remind myself of when I want to cut is that I am tired of hiding the cuts. I have scars all over my arms. At some point, it got too hot to wear long sleeves, and when I did, I would accidentally roll them up, then hope no one noticed as I rolled them back down. I just started telling people that it happened from wrestling with my dog. I even tried to cut in such a way that it would be believable. I got tired of making up stories. Every time I have the knife in my hand, I remind myself that one cut now to soothe the pain will be two weeks of having to lie and hope they believe me. I know it doesn't help with the pain or the reason why you want to cut, but it is the only thing that stops me some days. 
greenbird27314	Some days, I wish I didn't make it home | There are days when the sadness of the world gets to me so much, all I want is for something to happen on my way home to take me away from it all. I take the long way home (an extra 10 miles or so), to up the chances. A student told me this week that they do the same thing sometimes. I started working on other things to keep my mind off of it, so I wouldn't cry. I don't know if the tears were from the thought of losing another student to suicide, or the thought that this student might see the depression in me. He told me that he used to be like me, and he would always help others, but it was only to hide his depression. It made me wonder if he knew how depressed I was, and he was trying to reach out to me, to help me. I have an issue where a lot of students see me as a friend. A lot of them see how other students use me, and they want to protect me. They see me pour my heart and soul into students to try to get them through life, and the students just throw all of my love and caring away. I keep telling them that I am a teacher, and it is my job to give to my students, and I shouldn't expect anything in return. Some of them see the toll it takes on me. I try to hide it. I put a smile on my face. I goof around with my students. I try to always stay positive, but some of them see. I think they are afraid of losing me. The thought of leaving some of them without a caring person in their life hurts more than anything, but I think if they knew how much I was hurting, they would understand. I couldn't ever find the courage to do it on my own. I have tried, but I just don't think I could. I just wish something would happen to end it all. I wish God was ready for me to come home. 
greenbird27314	Thank you so much for your kind words. I try to tell myself that all the time. I am at a point now where I do honestly feel that people would care if I died. I used to not. I just don't know how much more pain I can take. I tried to talk to my sister about it yesterday, in hopes of finding help, but I just couldn't find the words. The only person that knows I have these thoughts, asks me to not talk to him about it, because it hurts him too much. I don't have a close enough relationship with anyone else to talk to about it. I am afraid to go to one of our school counselors for fear that they might report it, and I would be removed from my classroom: the one thing that keeps me alive. 
greenbird27314	I teach Geometry. I was teaching how to simplify radicals. One student gave an answer really quickly. Another said "you can't do it that fast". I said "you can if you use the pull out method". I heard a couple of giggles before I realized what I had said. I was referring to the method of pulling out perfect squares instead of the typically taught method of factor trees. So embarrassing. 
greenbird27314	It would be nice to think that someone like that might come along again, but it took 32 years to find this one. I don't think I can wait another 32 more. I still remember that moment that I finally gave in. After months of him begging. Something happened one night, and I was curled up on my couch, completely miserable. It wasn't anything huge, but I felt like I needed to talk to someone. I needed to let it out. I kept scrolling through everyone in my mind, and I couldn't think of anyone that would honestly care. Everyone would just judge me because I cared, because it was so small. All of a sudden, I thought about him, and I grabbed my phone and texted him. He just texted back "are you home?"  I told him I was, and then, a few minutes later, he was there, trying to cheer me up. Any time something bad happened, even if it was small, I just had to tell him, and there he was. And now he is gone. It breaks my heart. So many people kept telling me he was using me, and I should just let him go, but they didn't see how he was when they weren't around. They didn't see that one night that he was really mad at me (and had a right to be), and he still texted me that he loved me. They didn't see that he could just look at me, and even through my smile, he saw the pain, and would give me a hug, knowing that would make me feel better. They didn't see how many times he dropped everything to be right there next to me, just because something happened, and I was stressing over it. Now, they are all saying "I told you so." I still feel like he cares. I know I won't ever get him back, but I don't doubt how much he cared. I have occasionally doubted him, just because that is my nature, but he is the only one that I have always been able to suppress that doubt with.   Sorry. I know you didn't ask. It is just still so fresh.   I haven't ever spoken to a therapist. I can't afford one as a single teacher. My parents have that kind of money, but they don't believe in therapists. They think they always make things worse, so they wouldn't help me out. I asked in a round-a-bout way once, and I got shut down pretty quickly. 
greenbird27314	Thank you for your kind words. I have learned over the past year the importance of opening up to people. I finally found someone that truly seemed to care about me. Not in a romantic way. He just really wanted to be there for me. He used to get so upset when he knew something was wrong (he could always see it, even when no one else could), and I wouldn't tell him what it was. I finally started opening up to him, and he was really there for me. Unfortunately, he left me, just like everyone else always does. He left me when he finally turned his life around, and he didn't need me any more. That is the way everyone always is. Everyone needs me, but no one wants to help me. I know he really cared, but it is hard to not question it sometimes. I went back to my dark place when he left. That is where the new cuts came from. I don't want to go back there. Sometimes, shutting people out is the only way to avoid that place. 
greenbird27314	It never goes away | Today, I had to sit and talk with a student who is self harming.  "Had to" is a bad phrase.  I wouldn't say "got to" either.  I love this kid, and when I saw his scars, my only option was to try to help.  I knew he went through stuff last year.  He ended up in the hospital.  He talked with me when he got back to school, but not in that much detail about it.  He promised me he would never get to that point again.  I knew he didn't mean it.  He may have thought he did, but you can't ever truly mean it.  Today, he told me that it was an accident.  I told him that there was no way that you could cut that deep and leave a scar that bad if it was just an accident.  I know this from experience.  I know this because I have tried, and can't ever seem to cut deep enough.  Maybe, a part of me still doesn't want to do it, so I am not trying hard enough, but I know it takes too much effort for it to be an accident.  As we sat and discussed why he was cutting, I told him that what people don't understand is that depression never truly goes away.  You can cover it up with medication, you can find someone that makes you happy for a little while, but eventually, something will happen that will put you back in that dark place.  I told him that I needed him to know that, when he gets to that dark place, I am there.  As I was questioning him about his cuts, and why he does them, he said, "Why do you do it?  Don't think I didn't notice your band-aid on your wrist."  I explained it away, just like all of the other cuts on my arm.  They always believe me.  I almost cried right then.  I see the look in my mom's eyes sometimes when she sees a new one, but she doesn't ever say anything.  She just lets me keep doing it.  I think she tries to convince herself that I am not that depressed.  That there is no way someone as bubbly as me would ever get to that point.  There are only two people that have ever questioned it.  Both of them have been students of mine.  My friends and family don't care enough to say anything, but my students do.  Some days, my students are the only things that keep me alive.  Knowing they need me.  Knowing they care enough about me to ask me.  It sucks though.  The only people that care enough about me to ask how I am doing are the only ones I can't open up to.
greenbird27314	I didn't cry for a long time. I was told by so many people that I must be heartless. The people that knew me best knew that wasn't true. They would tell you I have the most caring heart. I have helped so many people through tough times. A floodgate opened last summer when I had to put my dog down. There are days when the only way I can make it stop is by cutting. I wish I could go back to the days when I didn't cry. I miss those days when I could take on everyone's pain and help them through their problems, and still go home and have a glass of wine to sleep it all away. 
greenbird27314	It has been a tough day | Some days are harder than others. Some days, I just stare at the veins on my wrists, thinking how fragile they look. How easy would it be? How much pain would there be? Could I put my mom through that? Not the pain of losing me. I don't think she would care. Just having to find me. Some days, I just don't know if there is anything worth living for. I know I have made a few connections, but they will forget about me soon, just like everyone else does. Everyone that acts like they care leaves eventually. Once I help them through their troubles, they leave me to deal with mine, taking another piece of me with them. Soon, there won't be anything left.   I thought I was doing okay. I always think that. "How could I have ever thought about doing that?" Then it happens. Another person gone. Another person who promised they cared, but didn't. Then, I remember. I remember why I hate being here.  I just want to not exist any more.
greenbird27314	You have to raise them right. It breaks my heart when people say this. I had one, and everyone was always afraid of her, but once they got to know her, they fell in love. She was such a sweetheart. I made sure she went every where with me when she was young to get used to people. Most people just don't realize they have to do that. Next time you see one, talk to the owner and give it a chance. They are sweethearts if raised correctly. 
greenbird27314	I completely agree you should always do your research before getting any dog. I just don't like when people see any type of breed and immediately judge the dog. Treating a dog like you think it will be aggressive could be what brings out aggression in an otherwise tame dog.   Chow chows definitely can be a handful, so I agree that you shouldn't go get one expecting it to just be a teddy bear come to life. For one thing, most don't even like being hugged. 
greenbird27314	When I was little, I out a donut in the microwave for 15 minutes instead of 15 seconds. I don't know why no one noticed. We always joke that it went in glazed, but came out chocolate. 
greenbird27314	Completely agree. As an AP Statistics teacher, I feel this graph was made perfectly. 
greenbird27314	Shortly after I bought my house, I was doing laundry. My washer and dryer were in the garage. I heard something hit my garage door, so I went outside. The neighbors kids were throwing huge chunks of concrete at my garage door with the parents standing right there just letting it happen. I got onto the kids. Things only got worse from there. I got a dog a few months later. The kids would constantly throw things at my dog, again, with the parents sitting right there. I finally told them that I didn't want them going in my backyard to retrieve their toys any more, and I started keeping them. Since they were doing it on purpose, I felt it was only fair. The parents would have parties until 4 in the morning on Friday nights, and I had to be at work at 8:00. Our houses were really close together, and they would stay outside on their patio which was basically right outside my bedroom window. I am a single female living alone, so I did not feel comfortable going over there to talk to them that late at night, so I called the police. After the police left, I heard them right outside my window. They were saying things like, "I think I can see her in there". Then, they started yelling things like, "No one fucks with, [whatever his name is]". I found the word "bitch" written in the dust on one of my window screens right next to where their sons have their basketball hoop. They didn't care that their sons would have to see that word every time they played basketball. They just wanted to be jerks. The funny thing is, I don't know how long it was there because it was on the side of my house that I only go to when I mow. I would constantly find food in my lawn, like they decided to throw it away in my lawn instead of use their garbage disposal. I even found bacon grease had been poured on the side of my house once. Luckily, I have an awesome family who helped me with a down payment on a house in a much nicer neighborhood. They didn't think that me being a single teacher should mean that I have to live under those conditions. 
greenbird27314	Inevitable | I think it is inevitable.  I don’t know when, where, or how, but I feel it is coming.  I have been thinking about it for too long, and the thoughts are only getting clearer and clearer.  I have avoided it so far, mainly due to the fear of living through it.  I can’t stand that thought.  I will at least wait until the school year is over.  I know the school can’t handle any more loss.  Maybe, if it is during the summer, it won’t bother people as much.  They can just act like it didn’t happen.  It wasn’t any one person that caused this.  It was everyone and no one, all at once.  It was me.  I cannot reach out to anyone.  I try.  I have tried to look at people and hope they see the pain in my eyes.  All I want is for one person to hear the scream, the cry for help.  Either no one can hear it, or no one cares to help me deal with it.  I want to reach out to someone, but I am afraid that either they won’t be willing to help me, leaving me with a sense of rejection, or they will think I am seeking attention.  I don’t want attention.  I just want help.  I am so tired of feeling like no one cares.  I am tired of never feeling loved as much as I love.  I am tired of not being loved back.  I know so many people feel they need me, but no one cares enough to be there for me.  Everyone just takes, and no one ever gives.  I just need someone, just one person, in my life that is willing to give a little.    People have asked me about my cuts.  I forget about them sometimes, and I take my hoodie off.  I have been trying to hide them, but I forget they are there.  I can tell some of them don’t believe my story of how I got them, but no one seems to know what to say to me.  If people really cared, they would try to help me.  They would send me to get help.  They would force me to talk to someone.  That is what I have done for people, but no one is willing to do it for me.    Maybe you all think I am strong.  Maybe you all think I have my stuff together.  I don’t.  It is a lie.  It is a lie that I lead everyone to believe.  I am weak.  I am a mess.  I just need someone to help me.  Why won’t anyone help me?   -A daughter, a sister, an aunt, a teacher

glitterqueenbee	[USA][H] WA cards!! [W] WA 1, 19, 22, 26, 30, 49 | [removed]
glitterqueenbee	...so do I like draw a smile on my foot or something, or? 
glitterqueenbee	That did make me smile a bit, so thank you, Mr Dennis II
glitterqueenbee	I have several WA duplicates, how many do you want for Tangy??
glitterqueenbee	Yeah I know she's gonna be very happy and well loved in her new home it just sucks because I really loved her. Thank you. 
glitterqueenbee	Thanks guys, I'm doing okay. I really appreciate the suggestions 
glitterqueenbee	Welcome Amiibo cards for trade? Only missing 6!! | [removed]
glitterqueenbee	Listen I love fall and this is so sweet and you sound like my kind of person. Receiving and returning your good vibes in MI. 
glitterqueenbee	I'm so glad you've got a happy story. ❤
glitterqueenbee	I'm proud of you for reaching out for help. I know that's very hard to do when you get to this point. I really encourage you to ask a professional for help, a doctor or psychologist. If you feel you want to attempt again please call 911 or a suicide hotline. 
glitterqueenbee	I am so gotdam proud of you, dude. That's a whole lot of shit to happen in one year. Kudos to you for looking at the positives, because it sounds like you had some great times this year too! I encourage you to keep chipping away at that degree, work at whatever pace your sanity and budget will allow, and don't let anyone make you feel bad for doing it that way. 
glitterqueenbee	Sometimes depression can happen in episodes, that is a valid term for it! Do you ever have episodes of high energy, impulsivity or insomnia? That could be a sign that your depression is a part of bipolar disorder. But it also could just be a cyclical form of depression. Not everyone's depression manifests the same way.   The best thing you can do for yourself is find out what gets you out of that slump. For me, it's usually forcing myself to get up and do something at least vaguely productive. Do the dishes, go for a walk outside, tidy a room, take a shower, anything that's going to get you out of your head. Also talking to someone (out loud, not texting, at least for me) can help pull you out as well. It takes time to figure out what works for you.   And remember that when you're feeling those things - useless, worthless, like nothing matters, nothing is enjoyable - remind yourself that's just the depression talking, and when you're feeling "normal," you don't think that way. There are things to live for and look forward to. There are things that make you happy.   If you haven't already, I highly recommend you see a psychologist or counselor. They can help you get a firmer diagnosis, and help you develop coping skills. I'm not a professional, but I'm here if you need any other help. Hang in there!
glitterqueenbee	Were you hospitalized or anything after the attempt, or did you just wake up and it hadn't worked? You should really consider going into a mental health facility if you're suicidal to the point you attempted. Sounds like you need some help. If nothing else, you should see a doctor/psychologist to try to manage whatever depression or mental illness is making you feel this way.   I'm glad you're still here. It's going to be okay. 
glitterqueenbee	Same deal, yeah. Some people only have depression or whatever mental illness for a period of time and then it gets manageable. Some people, like me, will likely have to be on meds for life. It could have to do with whether it was incident-based or genetic-based, because for me, it's in my genes and my relatives that had it had it for life. Looking at where your MI comes from - nature or nurture - *might* help you figure it out, but everyone is different. It's gonna take time to figure out. But if you are on meds for life, there's no shame in that. Some people are on insulin or heart medication or whatever else for life. You gotta do what you gotta do. 
glitterqueenbee	Is there a word for memories linked to smells? | Do you ever just smell something and remember a vivid, distinct memory associated with that smell? I know it's proven that smell is strongly linked to memory but is there a word for that?  Thanks! 
glitterqueenbee	That's crazy and also horrible. I'm so sorry that happened to you :( 
glitterqueenbee	This is the kind of quality portmanteau content I'm here for. 
glitterqueenbee	That make sense. For some reason I'm thinking there's a more specific word for that. But maybe not. Thank you! 
glitterqueenbee	Got a BA in Biblical Literature with an Ancient Greek emphasis! Hit me up, αδελφά!
glitterqueenbee	Did you have memory trouble before it? 
glitterqueenbee	[23][F][O] In for the night and here to be a friend | You feel alone? I feel useless. Let's have a symbiotic relationship. 
glitterqueenbee	I was in a LDR around your age, love. Message me if you need! 
glitterqueenbee	Hit me up, love! 
glitterqueenbee	I also have a hard time understanding how people have the will to live. I can't imagine. 
glitterqueenbee	That feeling can and will pass. I'm so damn proud of you for admitting you need help and if anyone tries to shame you for that, kick them out of your life. Counseling can help, meds can help, but it's a long and painful process (especially figuring out meds). Best advice for you is don't give up hope that things can get better. It's going to take time and hard work and sometimes you'll fail and sometimes you'll feel the same way you do now. But it does get better. 
glitterqueenbee	I too feel like no one ever wanted to be my friend. Seems like everyone I've tried to get close to eventually gives up on me. Maybe it's just a vibe some people give off. Maybe some people are just insufferable and don't know it. I don't mean to insult you, mostly talking about me. 
glitterqueenbee	I've tried several meds over the last 4 years and I've never really felt like it helped enough. There have been short periods, of a few months, when I have felt "normal," but then out of nowhere it stops working for me. I was completely off meds for almost 2 months and that didn't even seem that much worse.   I wish I had an answer for you. I've thought about looking into electroshock therapy, but I'm too broke to even consider that right now. I hope you're able to find something that helps you. 
glitterqueenbee	That is honestly what killed my dad. He was an alcoholic because he couldn't deal with his depression. My mom spent almost 20 years trying to get him help, taking him to doctors and counselors and psychiatrists. She finally left him because he refused to help himself and he was emotionally abusive. And then he killed himself.   Try and talk to him about getting help, but if he chooses not to, that's no one's fault but his own. If he truly loves you, he will want to get better and learn how to handle his problems. I hope your story ends better than mine. Good luck. 
glitterqueenbee	I have some of those same thoughts when I'm in a low place. Self hatred, questioning what the point is. But remember the times you've felt happy and fulfilled. Remember the joy and laughter you've felt before. Those feelings were real, and they can happen again. There are things worth living for. There is joy worth fighting for. Find the things that make you happy and cling to them. Know that these feelings of negativity and hopelessness will pass. I know because I've been in them too. They come and go but they're not forever. 
glitterqueenbee	I was at that point once. I had never thought about it before, and then one day I just thought, what if I did? What if it feels good?   I ended up doing it, and got addicted for years. It's such a horrible habit. I'm glad you thought your way out of it. If you do feel that way again, do everything you can to avoid it. If it does feel good to you, you're going to get addicted and it goes downhill fast.   If you want to message me next time you're thinking about it, I'll do what I can to talk you through it. 
glitterqueenbee	That kind of topic is always hard even when talking to someone directly, much less through a middle man.   I'm wondering if you could possibly write up a card for her (maybe play it off as a get well kind of card) and just say, y'know, I know we haven't really talked but I understand what you're going through and I really want to be here for you while you're dealing with this. And then give your number or contact info. And then have her sister give her the card? It wouldn't seem too weird to send a card when someone's been hospitalized.   I'm really really proud of you for wanting to reach out, I can't imagine what your cousin is going through right now but I'm sure knowing that someone out there cares about you and wants to support you would be really helpful. I've had plenty of experience with well-meaning relatives that don't understand mental illness and I'm sure your understanding would be much appreciated.   I hope things go okay for both of you!
glitterqueenbee	Your English is near perfect, don't worry about that! If you guys have been getting along well then I would say go ahead and ask her out! But as the other comment says she might already have plans, so don't be hurt if she says she can't.  As far as a gift, it depends on how well you know each other. If you really want to get her something, I'd suggest something small that you know she'd enjoy, like a keychain of a character she likes or a cd of a band she likes or something like that. A really expensive gift or really "romantic" gift like flowers could turn her off, so I'd stick to something very small that shows you care about her interests but isn't overbearing.  Good luck, I hope it goes well! :)
glitterqueenbee	I know it's addictive, I was there for a while. But it really is a bad habit. Please find a reason to stop, for your family, for yourself, for your future family, anything. You don't deserve to be hurt by anyone, including yourself. 
glitterqueenbee	Hey, I'm here if you need someone to talk to. 
glitterqueenbee	I'm sure they are, and I'm sure she misses you just as much as you miss her. But it will get better with time. I'm proud of you for getting to this point through all your struggles and I wish you nothing but luck, peace and happiness as you begin your college journey:)
glitterqueenbee	It's never too late, friend. Start small, maybe just job searching - you're not committing to anything, just looking and maybe sending an application or two. Figure out what you are passionate about, what makes you feel fulfilled. Maybe that can be a career. Then again, maybe it can't. Maybe you have to find a job that pays the bills but isn't draining and your passion is in your free time. In either case, finding out what makes you happy is really important.   The other important thing to take care of is those mental struggles. Are those things you've seen a professional about? Maybe you've been so stagnant because of untreated mental illness. I'm not sure what your story is, but if that is something you've been ignoring, maybe now's the time to do something about that.   Most of all, remember that it's never too late to restart. Your dad clearly cares about you and wants you to succeed, and I bet you have other friends and family that feel that way too. Let that motivate you, not discourage you. Don't give up, okay?
glitterqueenbee	I had that problem when I was in uni too.   The best advice I have for you, besides reaching out to your friends, which you seem to already be doing, is just go out and hang out in public. Go study in the coffee shop or student center or wherever people are. Sometimes you'll spend the whole time on your own, but just being around people can be helpful. And sometimes people you know will walk by and say hi and maybe even sit down to work with you.   I found when I was in uni that even though my first instinct was to hole up and isolate myself, I got more work done and felt less depressed when I forced myself to go out. I know being in school while depressed is really rough. Try to figure out what works for you and what you need to function best.   Side note, if your friends are too busy on the weekends with other plans, maybe talk to them during the week and set up weekend plans. Or if they perpetually blow you off, maybe find new friends. Best of luck xx
glitterqueenbee	I have a lot of problems with fatigue too, and the worst thing is most antidepressants - even if they do help your other symptoms - don't do much of anything for fatigue. Sorry, i guess I should start there first - are you on antidepressants? If you are, talk to your doctor about the fatigue persisting and see if there's anything you can add on. If you're not, maybe consider them?   I wish I had a good answer for you but I don't really know how to deal with it myself. 
glitterqueenbee	Well, it's your decision. You can either drop now while it's still in the first few weeks and go home, regroup and try again next semester. Or you can try to make it through one semester where you're at. Neither option is ideal, but you've gotta figure out what's going to be best for you.   As far as the "freshman" thing, I just meant other students who are moved out of home and away to college for the first time. You're not alone in missing home and maybe you can commiserate with others. 
glitterqueenbee	Hey friend, hang in there. I know figuring out meds is a clusterfuck and it sounds like you're right in the middle of that. Relationship issues definitely don't help.   My number one piece of advice is to just hold onto the things that make you happy, the things that make you laugh, the last time you smiled. Those are the reasons to keep going, even when your brain is telling you it's not worth it (or when the anhedonia kicks in and it doesn't feel like anything will make you happy ever again).   If you need someone to talk to, my inbox is always open. 
glitterqueenbee	The best thing you can do for yourself right now is try to stay strong and try to make the best of where you are right now. Try to make friends, find things you enjoy about this university, take good care of yourself, do your best in your classes. If you truly don't like this school after a semester or a year - you can transfer! People do it all the time. Debt from college is perfectly normal in today's day and age, so don't worry about that.   I know going off to school and leaving behind everything you know is stressful and scary, and your situation doesn't make it any better. But try to keep your head up, and maybe you can learn a thing or two during your time at that school. You aren't trapped, you have every ability to transfer to the school you liked or another school. Try to bond with other freshman, I'm sure there are plenty of other people scared and stressed from the big move.   If you feel your depression starting to get worse, reach out for help right away. Most universities have resources you can utilize - free or cheap counseling, group therapy, and references to doctors in the area. Don't be afraid to stand up for your mental health and ask for help if you need it. 
glitterqueenbee	It's probably safer to PM?
glitterqueenbee	You wouldn't be posting here if you weren't still wanting help. Clearly you've been through a lot, and your feelings are perfectly valid. But please don't end it. Call a suicide hotline or a mental health center. Don't give up. 
glitterqueenbee	I'm close to your age and female and I'm here for you, love. Hit me up. 
glitterqueenbee	I think I have a crush on both old you and current you. 
glitterqueenbee	How do you do those grid lines? Are they going to be on the final product?
glitterqueenbee	That's brilliant!!!! Aw man I'm gonna try that, thank you!
glitterqueenbee	Holy crap am I jealous
glitterqueenbee	That's awful, I'm so sorry. Sending love and healing your way. 
glitterqueenbee	I love it!! Bummer they stopped making those, but I bet you could do a similar look with those cube shelves that are so popular now. Thanks for sharing!
glitterqueenbee	Any other 20-somethings still struggling with (hormonal) acne? | Im 23 and still struggling with hormonal acne. It makes me feel insecure and I'm sick to death of it. I've been on the pill for about 2 years now, both for birth control and hormone control.  The acne itself is nothing crazy, but I pretty much constantly have several pimples on my face. Mostly on my chin and around my nose/mouth but also my forehead. I take very good care of my skin so I know the only culprit is hormones and the pill just isn't doing enough.   Has anyone else dealt with this in their 20-somethings and how have you been able to combat it? 
glitterqueenbee	Definitely considering it. Just figured I'd get some free input here first, lol. Thanks :)
glitterqueenbee	You were having skin problems because of your hair products? That's crazy! I use pretty good stuff so I don't know if that's the cause of mine but thanks for the input. I've heard pretty good things about Clinique for sensitive skin and all that so I'll check that out. Thanks! 
glitterqueenbee	I mean, I guess acceptance is a viable solution. PS I like your flair. 
glitterqueenbee	Don't compare yourself to others. Your life, your struggles are uniquely yours. Plus, everything you see on social media from your peers about how successful their lives are is edited to make them look good. The "happy couple" is probably fighting constantly. The girl with a lucrative internship gets bullied by her coworkers. Everyone wants their life to look good to the rest of the world.   Don't focus on them. Focus on yourself. Make your art for you, and the world will come along. I know it seems hopeless. But eventually, eventually things will look up.   Besides, plenty of successful people didn't get into their success until they were much older. Didn't Picasso not paint until he was 30 and Oprah not get into tv until 40 or something like that? I need some fact check on those. But for real. It's not the end of your life. 
glitterqueenbee	"Normal" is a subjective term. There's no shame in where you find happiness and hope, friend. 
glitterqueenbee	Hey friend, I'm with you on the whole "I could die and no one would care" thing. Felt that way for a while.   But listen, this is not the end of your life. I know it seems that way, and being rejected from a dream job like that must be soul-crushing and I'm so sorry that happened to you. I know being unemployed and in debt fucking sucks and dealing with all that on top of depression is even worse. But you have so much more of your life left to live. You will have more opportunities for art and advancing your career. This isn't the end of the line. Keep believing in yourself and following your dreams, you'll probably have to take some shite jobs in the meantime but we all do. Keep making art. If it's what you love, keep doing it. 
glitterqueenbee	Every experience you've had, every situation you've made it through, every lesson you've learned, every victory and failure has prepared you for where you are today. I know anxiety makes things seem insurmountable. When I was graduating college (just a year ago) I was utterly terrified of the outside world and getting a job and everything that comes with adulting. That's daunting for even a neurotypical 20-something. I'm sure it's 100x scarier for you.   But remember that everything life's thrown at you so far, you survived. Being an adult is taking it one day at a time. You make mistakes and learn from them. You depend on others and your parents for help. That's okay. It's okay to ask for help. Literally no one in your shoes has it all together. Don't let all those what-ifs eat away at you. You're gonna be okay. 
glitterqueenbee	I'll have to see what kind of issues my mom had, you're right, it's probably largely genetic. I'm glad you at least have something that solves it. Thanks for the input!
glitterqueenbee	I know it sucks. I feel the same. But we're so young with so much more left to learn and do.   No problem, friend. I'd want someone to do the same for me. Pay it forward. 
glitterqueenbee	Accutane seems like it's always portrayed as a last resort for people with really bad acne. Is that really true? Was the decision to put you on that because nothing else helped?
glitterqueenbee	So what you're saying is, I should learn to accept myself despite my flaws and love myself exactly how I am? That's such great advice, thank you :) 
glitterqueenbee	That's a great start. Keep finding support wherever you can. I'm here if you need someone and I know there are plenty of others in this subreddit that are too. Keep fighting, kiddo. 
glitterqueenbee	That's rough, buddy. I'm so sorry your parents aren't supportive.   Try and find support wherever you can. Friends that understand, teachers, the community here. Find reasons to live. Things you want to do, places you want to see, things that make you smile. Hold onto those. Things will get better, I promise. 
glitterqueenbee	See if you can talk to them about how you're feeling. In an ideal world, your parents should care about your wellbeing and want to do anything to help you. I know it doesn't always work like that.   If they really aren't going to listen, see if there are any resources through your school. I'm not sure how old you are and I won't ask, but whenever you become a legal adult, please seek more help with a counselor on your own. Your parents can't do anything then and it can really help. 
glitterqueenbee	Sounds like a horrible counselor. You're freaking paying them to take you seriously. I promise they're not all like that. You need to try someone else because I know from personal experience it can be reeeeeeally helpful. 
glitterqueenbee	I might look into that, thanks. Where do you get your supplements, are there certain brands more reputable?
glitterqueenbee	I'm thinking about seeing a derm for the same reason!! I'm just sick of this garbaaaage
glitterqueenbee	Have you considered seeing a counselor, friendo? Sounds like you're in pretty deep. I know that place. It's dark and horrible. It's not a good place to be. I hope you're able to find your way out. 
glitterqueenbee	See, but I LOVE chocolate. Guess I have to decide which feeling is stronger, love for chocolate or hate for acne. :( thanks for the input, love!
glitterqueenbee	If you hate it, then stop. Simple as that. You're not doing it for anyone but yourself. There's no shame in that. 
glitterqueenbee	Maybe take a look at the core reason you can't look at it. Is it because of the fact you don't feel joy from it anymore? Is it because you feel like you're not good at it or jealous of other more talented people? Is it another reason that I can't think of right now?
glitterqueenbee	Then don't believe in yourself. Believe in human nature. You have the ability to feel joy, because you've felt it before. Biologically, there's no reason for that ability to suddenly disappear. Believe that's there's good and happy things in the world. 
glitterqueenbee	See if you can make any of those stalls into something even a little enjoyable. I know the constant fighting and getting through another day is exhausting. Try to find as much purpose and reason to keep fighting as you can. 
glitterqueenbee	Hey friend, I'm proud of you. Keep unclogging stuff. 
glitterqueenbee	I think the big question you need to ask is this: does this not make me happy at any time, or is this just depression's anhedonia making me think it doesn't make me happy? I know I've had to ask that question about a lot of hobbies (including music) many times. Some of them I really didn't get that much enjoyment out of, but some of them I came back to and remembered why I loved them.   If it's truly not something you enjoy, nothing is holding you to it. There are tons of other hobbies out there to try. There's no shame in putting down the axe and picking up some knitting needles or something. 
glitterqueenbee	Happiness comes and goes, friend. Depression just makes you feel like it won't ever come back. That's not true. If you've felt happiness before, you can feel it again. Try to remember that and hold on until then. 
glitterqueenbee	There's no shame in a coping mechanism or in your choice of entertainment, so don't worry about that, friend.   I know that feeling, like your chest is hollow. But know it's not forever. Is there any way you can get a psych appointment any sooner? Maybe call and check on that.   In the meantime, you've gotta find positive ways to cope. I know I tend to veg out and watch YouTube videos but the sitting around with mindless entertainment really just perpetuates it. The best thing I've found to do is try to force myself to do something productive. Even just doing one little thing, like tidying one room or sewing a ripped shirt can help flip you out of a funk. I know some days you just can't. It's a constant battle. But see if you have even a little bit of energy in you to do something not mindless.   Hope that's a little helpful. Keep fighting, even when you don't feel like you can. 
glitterqueenbee	I'm so sorry you've received hate on this subreddit. This is supposed to be a supportive community and there's always going to be assholes that ruin things. Know that the majority of us don't feel that way and we're here with good intentions.   That's kind of how the whole world is, really: there's always going to be assholes that ruin things. You just gotta do your best to keep looking at the positives, the good people in the world, the cute puppies, the things that make you smile (even a little).   If there are any subreddits you follow that are more prone to negativity, maybe unfollow them and try to follow more wholesome content (my personal fav is r/wholesomememes ). I know that's not the best advice, but it might help a little.   Know you're not alone, friend. We're all in the same shitty, sinking boat. 
glitterqueenbee	Does anyone have any experience with hormonal acne on an IUD? I've been dealing with this on the pill for a couple years now and still no clear skin. Does an IUD help with that? 
glitterqueenbee	Merci!!!!!
glitterqueenbee	Merci, j'ai aussi des questions sur ces jokes! En outre, j'ai pas compris   Le "Ivan Potvin" ?  Les paraplégiques /super marché ?  Le drogues des nains (le mini pot, est-ce que le même d'américain "pot" ?)  Les mexicains - manger et pisser ?  Le spa à vendre ?   Merci beaucoup, je veux l'comprendre!!
glitterqueenbee	J'aDORE Stromae, Maître Gims et Oraelsan. They're all rap artists. You might be familiar with Stromae's Papaoutai, it got fairly popular (especially after Pentatonix covered it). Rap can be harder to understand initially (especially Maître Gims, il rap comme un bolide) but between listening and reading the lyrics you can get some great comprehension out of it, along with some awesome slang and wordplay.  You have to do some digging to understand some of the slang and such but if you're willing to do that it's awesome! 
glitterqueenbee	I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I myself am having relationship issues because they can't handle my depression so I know how it feels. Please, whatever you do, even though it feels like everything is falling apart, don't give up. Your life has the potential to continue and even get better. If this person doesn't see your worth through your illness, they never truly loved you in the first place. 
glitterqueenbee	I feel like I'm in a similar situation. Been married for just over a year and he's saying he regrets marrying me. That he wasn't prepared to deal with my issues (depression/bipolar, crazy mother, asexual). Maybe you and I can get divorces and run off together and support each other. 
glitterqueenbee	I did. It was a couple years ago but we wrote in to the company and said we couldn't afford a lot and I guess they gave it to us for free. I had tried several different medications before it, to no avail. I tried one of the antidepressants listed as best for my metabolism, and it did help me for a while (but it seems I only do well for so long on each of the ones I've tried). If you're in a similar situation where you're not sure what to try, it might be worth a shot.   Just remember that this is only testing how medications will be metabolized by your body. It is NOT testing what medications would "fix your brain" best. Something that it says will work well with your metabolism doesn't mean it's the right chemicals your brain needs. We don't have enough of an idea of how depression works to be able to test for that.   Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions. Good luck, I know what a b*tch it is to find proper meds. 
mgs108tlou	I just want to sleep forever. And I want everyone else to sleep forever so that I don't miss out on anything. | Currently waiting for my friends to text me the plans that are supposed to happen in 10 minutes but I know it's just going to be another lonely Saturday night alone in my room.   God I'm so lonely I can't even cry anymore. 
mgs108tlou	I enjoyed that way too much
mgs108tlou	Holy shit this actually explains a lot to me. So f1.8, for example, is not actually the same diameter on all focal lengths? So on an 80mm lens, the diameter would be about 44mm? Or am I misunderstanding?
mgs108tlou	Thank you very much for all your help, you've cleared a lot up for me. 
mgs108tlou	Could you explain what alters the depth of field of different lenses and sensors? Is there more bokeh in general on larger sensors?  Like if I use a f1.8 25mm on a mft and a f1.8 50mm on a full frame so it's an equal angle of view, which will have more bokeh? 
mgs108tlou	But if the hole for the light is bigger, doesn't it allow more light in making it more like an f1.4 or 1.2 on mft? I'm sure you're right it's just the logic to me doesn't make sene. 
mgs108tlou	Is an f1.8 lens on a Full Frame technically a larger aperture than an f1.8 on a micro four thirds? | Since the sensor is bigger and requires a larger lens, isn't the hole for the light larger?   If I have a full frame f1.8 lens and adapt it to an MFT body, would it be larger than f1.8 on the MFT?
mgs108tlou	The downvote wagon has taken off 
mgs108tlou	This was awesome thank you
mgs108tlou	I'm just curious, why are your text messages blue if he has a Windows phone? They should be green right? 
mgs108tlou	Lol what
mgs108tlou	There's a great Black Mirror episode that's kinda about this. 
mgs108tlou	I would understand if the photographer doesn't want to remove the water mark but maybe making it a little smaller would be awesome
mgs108tlou	Good heavens I'm uncomfortable
mgs108tlou	This screams Horizon Zero Dawn to me
mgs108tlou	Oh wow, thank you for clearing that up for me. Time to get back into Rocksmith! 
mgs108tlou	What do you mean "paid"?
mgs108tlou	Oh now that is really cool, thanks! 
mgs108tlou	I haven't played Rocksmith in a long time, what is this "custom songs" feature?
mgs108tlou	Mike Dirnt is legitimately one of the greatest bass players I've ever heard | Classic Green Day and new Green Day. I consistently am wowed by his work, especially compared to other rock bands. The mixing/production helps a lot too, the bass is a lot more prominent in GD tracks than other bands.   From Panic Song to Dirty Rotten Basterds, thank God for Mike Dirnt. 
mgs108tlou	Sorry I haven't kept up with the show in a while. Is there going to be another two hour Christmas Special like last year?
mgs108tlou	Thanks for the info!!
mgs108tlou	Oh shit!!! Have they said when it will air?
mgs108tlou	Don't be jealous
mgs108tlou	God I wish
mgs108tlou	I hadn't realized it until now but you're absolutely right. "Lifeless" is the perfect way to describe it. 
mgs108tlou	See it's the opposite for me, I tried playing the Witcher 3 on my PS4 projected on a ~70" screen (720p projector) and I couldn't read any of the small text because it was basically blurred out.   For me personally, 720p is just fine for movies but for gaming it could definitely be better. Just my two cents! 
mgs108tlou	Good lord that is an incredible line up...
mgs108tlou	Thanks for sharing!
mgs108tlou	This is fucking badass
mgs108tlou	Just look up interstellar behind the scenes on YouTube, there's plenty of them! They used very minimal CGI -- all of the ships were practical, they would hang them from cranes up in the sky, the giant bookcase was almost all practical at the end too. 
mgs108tlou	I think it's an extra $7 to stand there for a minute, it looks cooler than it actually is unfortunately. 
mgs108tlou	Yeah because the VFX on Interstellar were no less short of groundbreaking than Apes was, except it was all practical effects. Not to diminish what was done on Apes because I was conflicted about which one I thought should win but in the end Im glad Interstellar did because of its use of nearly all practical effects. 
mgs108tlou	I think Apes has a REALLY good chance of winning VFX this year because I don't think Dunkirk will match what they did on Interstellar, and it's not supposed to. 
mgs108tlou	Does anyone have any recommended camera straps? What are the ones you like to use the most? I'm looking to get a new one. 
mgs108tlou	What do you mean by 'digital back'? Instead of putting a roll of film back there there's some sort of digital sensor?   I'm completely new to film photography and really trying to learn about it. 
mgs108tlou	This is very interesting, thank you very much. 
mgs108tlou	The way the tape keeps the old paper underneath clean | 
mgs108tlou	Thank you for explaining that all so clearly! I have a question though; what is the purpose of putting the shutter inside the lens? 
mgs108tlou	Parking at the station?
mgs108tlou	I didn't know Yoji did art for this movie! I love his work for metal gear solid
mgs108tlou	This is more of a person preference, but I'd crop it to at least a 16:9. Maybe even more than that to give it almost a panoramic feel to it. 
mgs108tlou	There's a whole fucking planet out there full of places and people and activities and I'm never going to see all of it. | I don't know why this bothers me so much. There's just SO MUCH. And our planet is small! WHAT THE FUCK. There's so much fucking out there. 
mgs108tlou	I completely agree, part of which why it's such a great film
mgs108tlou	Fantastic movie
mgs108tlou	No money, school and work take up all my time. I can't quit work because I need the money for school, and I can't quit school because I need the degree to make money for later in life, right?   I study film who am I kidding I'm not gonna make shit
mgs108tlou	I really really liked this! How do you come up with scenery and visuals for music videos usually? I'm a film student and sometimes struggle to come up with visuals unless in there on set and have time to mess around with lights with a gaffer. 
mgs108tlou	Watch the assembly cut, much much better! 
mgs108tlou	Thanks for your help, I do think I need to start drinking more water anyway. 
mgs108tlou	The same as it has been for the most part. I've been under some stress recently but I just got home from school so that should be going down.   I've been getting stomach aches of unknown causes for a while but the bad highs have been happening before that. 
mgs108tlou	I used to feel great after smoking but now I start to feel dizzy and uncomfortable. | I used to feel awesome while high but now every time I smoke or eat an edible my blood sugar plummets and I get dizzy and a headache and become extremely weak. I usually drink soda or something sugary and it helps but I still don't feel great. I mostly just get super tired without being high.  What is happening? I really love smoking and relaxing and listening to music but it's been very hard to do that lately. Am I smoking too much? Friends say I turn pale sometimes.   Please help me Reddit lol
mgs108tlou	Honestly it looks like an accident based on the way the guy holding the pipe runs away
mgs108tlou	Well I mean I don't know, the guy is pointing to something up higher and then the arm just smashes into the side. Maybe they did it earlier than planned or something idk
mgs108tlou	Why are you getting down voted?? I agree with you man haha
mgs108tlou	Not OP but set either your camera on phone on a tripod and don't move it. If you're shooting on a phone you can only hope for enough light so it doesn't look shitty (unless you have one of those "advanced" camera apps. If you're shooting on a DSLR then set your ISO to around 1600 and leave your shutter open for maybe half a second. Also have your aperture pretty wide open. It really all depends on the situation that you're in with lighting and such.   Once it's all set just take a picture every 5 - 10 minutes (depending on how much movement you wanted to see in the moon) using the timer set at 2 seconds (so you don't get any shake) and then compile all the images into a program like Lightroom or something equivalent.   Hope this helps. There's lots of more detailed tutorials you can look up online! 
mgs108tlou	I'm not totally sure why you're being down voted so much, I mean, sometimes you CAN see the moon in the late afternoon. Not every day or all day but sometimes after 2 or 3pm where I live I can see the moon high in the sky. 
mgs108tlou	Thanks for clearing this up for me!
mgs108tlou	So could there be any way to use a touchscreen without problem in the shower or in the rain, etc? Or does there need to be new technology developed? 
mgs108tlou	ELI5: Why do touch screens react to water? | I think I read somewhere that newer touchscreens react to heat signatures as well as +/- charges (could be wrong about that), so why do touchscreens react in strange ways when it comes in contact with water.   Like if your phone is water proof and you put it under water the screen can start doing wierd things. 
mgs108tlou	Your photos are jaw dropping! Amazing!
mgs108tlou	I see your point but I think it couldve gone either way. Maybe it's just because I see and hear about more violent liberal protests, etc that leads me to believe the attacker was liberal. Whatever the case, the political standpoint of the attacker doesn't matter as much as the idea of the attacking being about politics, despite the OP. I just think the political beliefs at DePaul get out of hand and, to a point, childish and ridiculous.   People really just need to calm down here. The world hasn't ended (yet). Protesting won't accomplish anything substantial. 
mgs108tlou	Dude put two and two together. It could go either way. It doesn't necessarily have to be a liberal who attacked. I think it's more likely but the fact of the matter is the students at DePaul have a very strong central political ideology that could easily cause anger among those who don't share said beliefs. 
mgs108tlou	I'm just saying. All it takes is for two people to be angry and one to lose their temper. Doesn't seem far fetched to me, especially when politics are involved. Especially now.
mgs108tlou	How about the student body of DePaul being ridiculously anti-conservative? It sounds ridiculous because it is. Not sure if someone would actually stab someone over political differences at DePaul but it wouldn't surprise me.   Edit: Forgot to mention that there was a protest at the student center around the same time I believe. All it takes is someone angry with a loose temper. 
mgs108tlou	Chaos would ensue, no doubt. 
mgs108tlou	What is a BHA? 
mgs108tlou	I'm really hoping there will be a director's cut. I absolutely loved the movie but the third act is definitely rushed. Right now it's sitting at an 8/10 for me but with some more backstory of David and Shaw and David's motivations when he released the virus it could easily go up to a 9/10.  Edit: Especially considering how much footage is missing from the film. There might be more we haven't seen yet.  
mgs108tlou	[SPOILER] Does Covenant ever specifically say... | ...that David created the first Xenomorph?  There is a lot of evidence throughout both Prometheus and Alien (1979) that the Xenomoprh has existed long before David created it.   In Prometheus there is the mural. In Alien it's said that the Space Jockey's ship had been crashed for a thousand years and had eggs in the storage hold.   After studying the engineers aboard the crescent ship, perhaps David wanted to recreate the biological weapon known as the Xenomorph? The chest bursting scene isn't even the same as in all the other movies; the Xenomporph is just a mini version of itself, leading me to think that David didn't perfect it.  I don't know maybe I'm missing something. I'm not the biggest fan of the franchise but I do greatly enjoy the films. I was just curious as to why I haven't seen anyone bring this up before.  Or maybe I just missed it somewhere on Reddit lol
mgs108tlou	I don't think those are necessarily plot holes, they're just unanswered questions. I'm assuming more of David's and the Engineer's story and motivations will be revealed in Alien: Awakening. The writers created all this back story for the film but none of it was used. There's an interview on Hollywood Reporter but I can't seem to find it right now.  
mgs108tlou	Scott talked about Jesus being an Engineer? I thought that was purely a fan theory. Do you have a source for that, I'm just curious to see what he has to say. 
mgs108tlou	There's still at least one more movie and it could provide some answers.   Edit: Also, I usually take what writers/directors say in interviews with a grain of salt. In an interview I saw with Ridley, I don't think he confirmed the idea that David created the Xeno but he didn't deny it either. 
mgs108tlou	I flinched 
mgs108tlou	Hold the door was the only scene of the entire series that shook me up tbh. GOT has great characters, but nothing in that show really gets me going like the Leftovers does. 
mgs108tlou	I think he may be referring to how this myth started on reddit. This picture is actually from Alaska.   Edit: I believe this is what he's referring to: https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-the-Baltic-Sea-and-the-North-Sea-merge

mgs108tlou	Wow that's awesome! Thanks for the info!!
mgs108tlou	I've been up to the 34 floor in the hotel and the view is great but I'd really love to go to the roof. What do you mean "reach out to them via email"? 
mgs108tlou	Is there any possibility of DePaul leaving the quarter system and starting a semester system? | You know, so we can have the same breaks as everyone else? 
mgs108tlou	Check out apartments in River North too if you don't mind living two red line stops south of LP. I've seen single studios for $800/month and come with all amenities. Plus it's closer to the Loop campus if you have classes down there. 
mgs108tlou	Pros: sometimes being in the city is nice. The school itself is very nice and most of the buildings are beautiful and new.   Cons: being in the city can be exhausting, loud, and expensive. The quarter system is a lot of work and we get a pointless month long break in the winter and get out a month later than everyone else in the summer. It's really hard to make friends if you dont "rush" or have interest in any of the clubs.   Also, winter quarter is awful. It's super cold and there isn't much to do.
mgs108tlou	It was actually rather interesting at first, it just didn't go anywhere. 
mgs108tlou	Do you have to check gusts in at Sanctuary Hall? | I'm thinking about living there next year but at Centennial Hall I don't think you have to check anyone in, just swipe your card to open the door which is so much better than having to deal with the guest policies.   Thanks 
mgs108tlou	thanks man
mgs108tlou	Season 3 and definitely season 4 are even better than Westworld in my honest opinion. Obviously it had more time to grow but I still think it's worth noting that POI wasn't your typical CBS show.

mgs108tlou	Reminds me of pink Floyd's animals
mgs108tlou	The trailer isn't a great representation of what the film is. Those themes and elements are definitely a part of the film however there is a lot more to it. 
mgs108tlou	If you feel like you've forgotten how to feel anything, if your chest is empty and dull, watch a film called Mr. Nobody on Netflix. | It's been my favorite film for the last three years (I study film so that has to count for something) and I've been depressed for about five years.   This is a story about a man finding meaning and purpose. You must watch the film to experience it for yourself. No words I write will do it justice. It will make you think and wonder. It will make you gap in awe. It will make you smile and laugh but mostly it will make you weep. It'll add a little something to that emptiness you carry inside you every day.    Read u/lurkinsohard 's post about his/her experience with the film:   After watching the movie, I was at a loss for words. I have always been fascinated with the concept of the butterfly effect, or infinite parallel lives that stem from every decision we make. Throughout each day I find myself thinking about the infinite number of paths my life could have taken at any given point in time. To be honest, it is overwhelming. Every time I think about what I should do with my life, I start to panic. There are so many choices, what do I choose? What is the best path? What if I choose the wrong path? The second I make a choice, I instantly eliminate an infinite number of other options. I guess the thought of eliminating options is the concept that actually scares me. After reading your post, I was flooded with emotion. I went through something incredibly similar to how you are feeling. I wondered what is the point to all of this? It would be so easy to just remove myself from the decision making process permanently, because then I wouldn't have to worry about this any more. That to me, seemed relieving on a profound level. Thinking this way really changed the way I lived my life. When you are contemplating death, everything else seems dull in comparison. My only escape from my head and the stress came from living in the moment. I had to make a conscious effort on a minute to minute basis to focus only on the here and now. Every time I would think about stupid stuff I did, or how stressful the future is. I would tell myself to stop. Then I would open my eyes and look around. I would appreciate all the beauty that I would not be seeing if I had taken my life. I take a deep breath through my nose and think about how wonderful this smell is that I would have never smelled if I had taken my life. Even if it is a wretched smell, I still appreciate it for the experience that could have never been. I choose to appreciate the smallest of things on a minute to minute basis, because I believe there is a version of myself that killed himself and never got to experience any of this. The conclusion I came to is I could look at my life as I am in a sea of infinite possibility and if I swim the wrong way, I could drown. Or I could imagine the infinite number of realities where I have already drowned. I could have died at young age or never have been born, or I could have taken my life when I was feeling down. I like to imagine this is the only one path that made it to 24 years old out of an infinite number of possibilities. I imagine this as the golden path, or best case scenario. When I think of it that way, it doesn't seem so daunting. No matter what I do, I am still the record holder in an infinite number of possibilities. I know this was kind of dark and I blabbered on, but I hope you know you are not alone. There are other people out there that go through these times. You just have to find what mindset allows you to move past it. I choose to believe I am the best possible path taken and the record holder at longest life, lol. I hope this helped.
mgs108tlou	Now I know why they say a nuclear explosion looks like a sun being born.
1unknownaccount	The "I want out" feeling is getting unbearable | I started a new full time job on Monday (9-5 in an office); 3 nights out of 5 I've ended up crying myself to sleep thinking about how miserable I am vs how happy I was only a couple of years ago. 1 thing changed and just like that I've been depressed for 2 years and my introverted/shyness turned into full blown social anxiety. I've distanced myself from all my friends, so much so that they basically forgot I exist.. I've failed at being a good son to my parents by being a complete mess for the past 2 years.. I don't take care of my diet or even bother with the gym anymore.. I just don't care.  I don't see myself changing for the better any time soon and I can't take it anymore. The only thing that has helped me so far is medical marijuana at night but even that is temporary and not a true solution. My work is under a 10 month contract and once it's up I seriously don't know what I'm going to do. I'll be 26 and to be honest right now I don't see myself going past 30. The only thing that could hold me back is my parents.. not because I like them too much to take my life, but because I know that they genuinely love me and that it would ruin theirs.
1unknownaccount	I can't stop thinking about past failures and the "I want out" feeling is getting unbearable | I started a new full time job on Monday (9-5 in an office); 3 nights out of 5 I've ended up crying myself to sleep thinking about how miserable I am vs how happy I was only a couple of years ago.

1unknownaccount	[QUEBEC] Can I sue a cosmetic company for not disclosing anything related to potential side effects on their label and ruining my hair and my scalp? | Just for context, I did a course of Accutane in 2015 and I noticed that I was losing slightly more hair than usual when I would comb it or style it but nothing out of the ordinary (a few strands here and there because my hair was really dry). I knew that it was a potential side effect and that it is usually temporary. This slight increase of hair loss was still happening months following my treatment. For a reason that I can't explain, instead of going to my dermatologist to make sure that the slight increase of hair loss I was noticing was normal, due to Accutane or due to something else, I went to see my dad's GP. My dad started thinning at the crown in his 40s but he still has most of his hair today and he's in his 50s (I'm 25 years old). That GP refused to acknowledge that Accutane could be responsible for hair loss two months following my last pill so he assumed that it was instead due to genetics even tho he never made me do a blood test. I don't have the picture he took of my hair that day but I plan on getting it in the next couple of weeks; I wasn't receding and I had no thinning at the crown. The only thing that could potentially be flagged as a sign of hair loss was the fact that I had a cowlick but I've had that cowlick ever since I was a kid. Anyways, he recommended me Finasteride/Propecia which I took but stopped taking a few months later.   Where the problem lies is that I somehow got convinced by my dad's GP that I was losing my hair and that eventually I'd be bald if I did nothing. To help with the "hair loss", my mom bought me a shampoo kit by Nioxin. Apparently Nioxin used to say that their products would slow down the dht on your scalp which they had to remove from their labels because it was simply not true. Now they only mention that it thicken thin hair. From what I've read, the company responsible for the production of Nioxin changed over the years and the list of ingredients also changed. If you go on their Facebook page or different outlets on the internet, you'll see that a lot of people praise them for their products. Also, you'll see that a lot of people are furious that they've had intense allergic reactions following the use of their products even tho they don't disclose it on their products or their website (if they do it's almost impossible to find). In my case, when I began using their shampoo kit, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary but slight itchiness on the scalp. Fast forward a few weeks, I started noticing that not only was I losing hair, but the few strands I would see in my hands became hundreds. The sensation of itchiness I had on my scalp a few weeks earlier became a burning sensation and my healthy white scalp was now pink/red. I freaked out and went to see my dermatologist. He told me that I was experiencing symptoms of Seborrheic Dermatitis. He recommended a coal tar shampoo so I stopped using all Nioxin products at that moment but the symptoms didn't stop. At that point I did some research and I realized that even tho my symptoms were similar to those of Seborrheic Dermatitis, it was most likely that what I really had was Contact Dermatitis due to an allergic rection to an ingredient in Nioxin. My dermatologist told me that it was a possibility but he could only confirm it with a patch test.   This meeting with my dermatologist occurred in the summer of 2016. We're now a year later, and I can attest that I've permanently lost at least 50-75% of my hair density. I've receded a bit but what's more noticeable is the diffuse thinning. I still have pink/red scalp at the crown and I still have dandruff. I've buzzed my hair a few months ago and, even tho I don't really notice hair strands falling out anymore since my hair is so short, I can still see that my condition isn't improving. My hair was never really the biggest concern for me because I knew that due to genetics there was a possibility of me losing it once I grew older. But, I never envisioned that I would almost go completely bald in the span of 1 year. I don't think my hair is ever growing back but hopefully my scalp is able to heal eventually. I've had a pretty rough time accepting it and, as stupid as it sounds, it actually made me depressed/socially anxious because I'm ashamed of myself.   I never thought about a lawsuit following this experience, but I found out that there was a class action lawsuit that was won against Wen a few years ago by women that had bald spots following the use of Wen products. The only thing that puts a doubt in my mind is that I found forum posts about people noticing side effects from Nioxin in the mid 2000s but no lawsuit was filed ever (I think). Should I consult a lawyer or would it be a waste of time? Is there a legitimate case or am I just an idiot for not researching thoroughly these products before using them?

Le-Tap	My Therapist Died. X-post with r/Depression | My Therapist Died. X-post with r/Depression  I thought about how I could write a thoughtful post about my experience losing my therapist. The bullet points of all the things I wanted to get across, the metaphors are bleeding through as I feel out all the emotions running through me when I think about it. But I think I'd feel better just ranting/mumbling for a bit.   My therapist died a few weeks back and I'm still processing it. Let's call her Beth (not her real name). Beth was not my first therapist. I've been in and out of therapy since 2004. The first therapist I ever went surprised me when he thought I was dealing with a deep depression. I was incredibly sad at that time and cried randomly at the thought of my situation. But I wasn't ready to accept it, I didn't believe I had depression, I thought I was just not trying hard enough. It was my fault that my life sucked. I became manic and did a bunch of things that created a lot of change in my life but didn't heal the hole in it from that period.   I didn't start therapy again until a few years later when I completely broke down across the country after pursuing a new career there. I lost my job, ruined all my relationships, and could barely function because I didn't face and work through my anxiety, depression, trust & intimacy issues.   I came back home hitting rock bottom and accepted that I needed help. I went through a bunch of therapists dealing with my lost of my previous life and my anxiety issues but I never really made a connection with these therapists. I'd make a breakthrough or get frustrated with working with the therapists and I'd bounce out within 2-3 months. It wasn't until I started therapist with Beth that   I found someone who could deal with my shit. Deal with my shit, I'm crying just writing that. Actually, acknowledge that someone "got me" is a big deal in my life story. I grew up not having that feeling of people accepting me for me, of loving me for me. The first time I felt that type of empathy, love and connection was when I was 21. Ever since it is one of the biggest things I want and that I'm afraid of having because of how vulnerable I feel while having it.   This connection, this relationship, this relating and understanding between two people didn't happen all at once. I remember a few months back Beth said that first year was like playing a mindgames with a patient doing everything that could to hide their feelings, to not let people in on their pain or joy. I knew I was spinning my wheels a bit in therapy, I wanted answers to the things I was going through without opening up about what was really happen, how I was really feeling. What made Beth awesome was she would play those games. She would work with the bullshit I was sputting out to try to get slowly over time to the truth of the matter. My anxiety would trigger like crazy at these times but after a year I had trust in Beth in those moments when I couldn't put my feelings into words, or ugly cried, that I wouldn't feel judged. She felt proud when I made steps to overcoming my anxiety or depression. She spent weeks and months just listening to me grief over my inability to make things work, to build my life back up like I was able to before. But I got better over time and Beth was one of the big reasons why.   I spent over 3 years in therapy with Beth before she suddenly and unexpectedly died a few weeks ago. Our connection never left those walls of her office. I don't have a picture of her to remember her by. I fear like most things in my life, that feeling/connection I felt would be lost to time. I feel like one of the people who understand me the most in my life is gone and with her a part of me.   I searched the internet for how to work through losing your therapist to death. Some say you'll grieve it and you'll move on. Others never do. You might never work well with a new therapist or it will take a long time to establish that trust again. I don't know how I'll deal with these emotions and what my journey will be like. I've gotten more depressed in the past few weeks. I'm grieving. I want to stop fighting through my issues at least for a little bit. But when I think back the lessons I learned in therapy. That Beth "saw me for me" and wasn't ashamed of me. That she saw the good inside of me when I saw none, I feel the urge to fight for her too. To take all the good changes I've made over the past three years and continue on.   Whatever new therapist I go to next will be nothing like Beth but I know I still need the help. I still struggle and may always somewhat struggle with my mental illnesses but that I'm in a better place now for opening up and for truly connecting with my therapist to heal and grow will always stay with me.   I miss you Beth and I appreciate the work, the fun, the cries we had in therapy.

Le-Tap	Enhanced Brain Sci-Fi Books Akin to Nexus | I'm looking for recommendations of sci-fi books where computer devices are put into the brain like the Nexus series or Wired series. Anything from the last 5-10 years would be great. Thanks!
Le-Tap	Thanks for the rec. I've read them :) 
Le-Tap	Warriors Now Have The Greatest ELO Rating in NBA History Beating the 96 Bulls According to FiveThirtyEight | 
Le-Tap	1856 Rating After Beating Cavs In Game 1. Bulls All-Time rating was 1853.
Le-Tap	Nooooooooooo I wanted this rivalry to go back and forth. 
Le-Tap	its less about the awkwardness and about sharing details about life outside of the hobby + having the guts to want to keep in touch. If I know I'm going to an event where I won't need to open up or connect with people, its easy for me to socialize with crowds. I still feel anonymous. Thanks for the support!
Le-Tap	Thanks. This will be a big week to test my progress.
Le-Tap	Yeah. Sunlight is def. helpful to get in the first hour of the day to get things going.
Le-Tap	nice, share some over pm if you'd like!
Le-Tap	5.07 LT AVPD Update - On What Makes Me Happy and Upcoming Work/Social Challenges |  Hey Y'all,  LT here. Yay, I didn't avoid writing this! Diagnosed with AVPD 3 years ago. Been avoiding stuff/having anxiety since I was a kid. I started this weekly update a while back on this subreddit.  **Biggest accomplishments in the fight against Avoidance?**  Sometimes I forget what makes me happy. You think you would always remember what that is and always be doing it but nope. For me some of the things I did this week that helped me fight against avoidance     1. Music - the more I listen to the better I feel  2. working out - keeps me from feeling sluggish which leads to a down/giving up type mood  3. Laughing somehow. Videos, posts, old classics you like. A day without laughing feels odd.   4. Getting some sun when it is sunny.    I'm sure there are a lot more things that if I did would make me happy when I remember them and can do them more consistently I will. Been happy to integrate music/searching for new cool music back into my routine.   I have a one-day work gig working an event on a yacht this Thursday. I was going to cancel because I felt that anxiety building up but now I feel a lot better committing to it. I'll be at a big event with 500 people on a boat serving them. I don't mind serving folks as long as I don't have to talk to each person more than a minute or two. So it should be fine.   There is also a meetup for folks who like a hobby I like in the city I live near on Friday night at a bar. I feel like this is going to be a big test to see how much anxiety I feel about meeting new people and trying to find new friends.   **Failures of Anxiety Avoidance this week**:   - Taking more steps to find work (10 on the anxiety scale) - Avoiding contacting the few friends I have to hang out. (8 on the anxiety scale)  Hopefully, I'll take the few big steps I'll outlined above on the work/social front later this week. See Y'all next week.  
Le-Tap	Yeah. This is a thing I deal with too with family. I've had to teach them over time that it had a big impact on my mood and my ability to do things they ask me to help with.   They have learned to ask nicely/slowly and wait 10-20 seconds for me to get settled to respond. Sometimes I want to do it but want to do it in a few minutes. Before they would get mad that I didn't want to do it but now they know that I do want to do it but need to focus past my anxiety.
Le-Tap	This is really hard to parse through. Can you rephrase it? 
Le-Tap	Not really. Usually going to 1 on 1 therapy is a big challenge because folks with AVPD can't open up to therapist and establish a connection to work out the issues they face.
Le-Tap	The hardest thing in beating your enemy is not knowing who your enemy is. Now you know and you can work on it. Good Luck! 
Le-Tap	My work history is complex. In my early 20's before I knew I had AVPD, I was able to take all my frustrations related to avoiding into 1 grand gesture of moving cross country without a job and pursuing my dream industry. I grinding lots of different jobs in so many industries and had success in a lot of different ways. But I would either quit each job when i thought I wasn't learning anything or felt I wasn't doing a good job. Sometimes I would be fired if It looked like I wasn't doing all the work. Never was able to keep down a job for long. Longest was 2 years straight. Last 5 years I haven't worked for the most part as I had a breakdown after losing a bunch of my relationships, health issues, and being laid off my job. Moved back home and now I feel like I'm ready to get back into the workforce.   I am not going to pretend I'm normal and take any job but I'm not going to avoid doing jobs that feel uncomfortable. If its meaningful, I want to fight through it. 
Le-Tap	The only thing I can relate to is the idea of wanting to get my money's worth. I am disappointed most of the time I spend money on experiences. But when I do get a great experience, I want to pay all the money in the world to reward it.
Le-Tap	I don't know if I hate the behavior you have but I freeze up when criticized by family and stop talking and just want to run away from the situation. They may be asking me a question and I won't answer it because I'm dealing with an internal anxiety attack. It slowly goes away and I can answer 5-20 mins later but by then they get angry and don't want my help anymore.
Le-Tap	I don't mind lots of people when I walk in the city as long as they don't interact with me. 
Le-Tap	Music. Working Out. Being Out in the sun. making up random small creative projects to work on.
Le-Tap	Yo make sure it is AVPD. don't label yourself if it isn't that. Mental Illness bleeds into a spectrum. You can have traits of AVPD without having it. That's why its important to get diagnosed.
Le-Tap	Yeah. I delay my health stuff sometimes. The biggest being a dentist. I don't want to know how bad they might be. As long as my teeth don't hurt, I'm fine not getting the checkups <_<;; 
Le-Tap	4.30 LT AVPD Update | Hey Y'all,  LT here. Yay, I didn't avoid writing this! Diagnosed with AVPD 3 years ago. Been avoiding stuff and having anxiety since I was a kid. I started this update last week on this subreddit.  So I wanted to do something social this week as a goal but I got bad news from my doc on the health front and I've been dealing with that.  **Health Complications. How do you respond to it?**  I got a call from my regular doctor on Monday telling me he had to talk to me about my blood test results from last weeks checkup. I called him back and found out that sugar level was almost 400 (regular less than 150) and my cholesterol levels was over 350 (Regular less than 170). So yeah, he freaked me out saying I needed to take drugs asap to control it. I spent the next few days working with my health insurance and the pharmacy to try to get the meds.   **The Good thing that came from the situation:**  I reacted a lot better to the news now at 32 than I did when I first was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 17. I got super depressed when I was younger and let that flaw define my behavior and my self-esteem plummeted. This time I knew it was because I was bed-ridden from another illness for a few months just recently. So no cardio/bad eating probably triggered this result. I didn't avoid the problem. I knew I needed to increase my physical activity and eat better. I've made strides and even in a short time of a few days, I feel better.   I have been sick most of my life and it used to define me 100%. I'm getting better at not letting it stop me from believing I can do things with my life. When I'm relatively healthy, I do things. When I'm sick, I try taking care of my self. As long as I can keep this perspective, I'll be able to make the most of my life.  **So what am I avoiding that I want to work on this week?**  I've been out of the job for a bit and been avoiding looking for a new one. I need to get a new job in 45 days or so. So I'll commit to looking at craigslist around my area and making a spreadsheet of all the type of jobs there are.   As for Social, I want to spend 30 minutes walking around a different part of the city I live near. I wanted to figure out cool stuff to do but I think that is harder than just going somewhere and wandering around.   Hope your week was fine. No week is going to be perfect or according to plan. If we can still take steps against our avoidance, we'll get somewhere :D Keep going.  - LT 
Le-Tap	feeling accepted even by a therapist might take a long long time. I only felt accepted by my therapist after 2 years I think. 
Le-Tap	I've spent over 150 visits with a 1 therapist working on anxiety and avpd. I see a big difference between the first visit and now but during the whole process, I didn't feel much progress. My therapist isn't just a listen to you and let you talk type of therapist. She asks a lot of questions, comes up with her own stories sometimes on why a behavior I'm doing is not the best for me.   The first 6 months was me slowly explaining (or needing to explain) my whole past in small amounts to her. "To be understood" So it takes time.   Not all therapists are good. I've had experiences with over 10 therapists in my time and only 2-3 were great. Did you ask if the therapist has experience with people with AVPD? My Therapist has battled avoidance too in her life (maybe not as bad as me but...)   Changing each mindset, or looking at emotions and desensitizing them or asking why you do certain behaviors all take their own time.   I think now if I list the amount of stuff I've accomplished it is a lot in therapy:  1. No more consistent negative self-talk 2. No more rumination of past events or mistakes. 3. Depression has become extreme low-key vs. how bad it was before. 4. I am more emotionally balanced in how I react in low-key triggering anxiety episodes. 5. I'm slightly more open to criticism from family on sore topics. 6. I do less self-sabotaging behaviors.  7. My perfectionism is not there as much.  etc etc. So there is a lot of progress. My day to day is a lot more peaceful. Now I just work on Avoidance to do things that I want in my life.  
Le-Tap	Thank you for this write up!
Le-Tap	Felt good today telling a friend I had AVPD over the phone | 1 Step forward!   I was talking to a friend who I interact with on the phone once every few months as I'm across the country now. In the course of the conversation, I told them that I had AVPD. It felt great saying I had a personality disorder but so frustrating trying to explain it.   This person understands that depression and anxiety disorders are real but I had no great way of explaining what Avpd is. I read the resources we have linked on the side and the basic explainer sucks. I wanted to explain why I avoid things and how I could possibly have no self-esteem even after doing cool things. I think I'm gonna work on an email explaining it better after I research it more.  What is the minimum you'd want to explain about AVPD to get it across? 
Le-Tap	Hope it works out for your group! I mainly working through it with a therapist, so I'm fine right now. Good idea though.
Le-Tap	I appreciate the support!
Le-Tap	How did what go? O:
Le-Tap	4.23 LT AVPD Update | Hey Y'all,  I'm LT. I'm in my early 30's and I was diagnosed with AVPD about 3 years ago. I had been struggled from a breakdown for a few years prior and only found out after trying to get medication help for the depression/social anxiety symptoms I felt from a psychiatrist. I've had challenges with anxiety since I was a kid and depression starting in my early 20's. But I never thought I had a personality disorder until I was diagnosed.   I've been working very slowly through my issues with the help of therapy and medicine when needed. I guess I should get on with it, the backstory would take hours to write.   Here is my weekly blog entry on what I'm challenged by this week:  **Going to a Strangers Bday party in the Park that my friend invited me to**   I've been out of the loop social for a long time because  I got sick from a rare disease I had for the last 4-5 months. I've had almost zero social interactions in that time. As we know, once you stop doing something as a AVPD'er, it is hard to get back into it because you fear you might be able to do it anymore. Having such a low self-esteem, I'm always afraid of getting back on the horse.    So I had enough courage this week to text a person I trust a bit to hang out alone. She texted back that she is busy that day and that she had to go to a birthday party of a friend and that I should come. This felt like a really scary situation. I trust hanging out with her and not feeling judged, but one of the things I really struggled with was this idea that I know she won't judge me but I must have acted a certain way to make her like me, what if the other folks see other parts of me and can tell something is off. IF they know , then maybe she will finally know and won't want to be friends with me.  It sounds stupid but I think its a big concern for avoidants. So I said "yeah that sounds like it might work" to give myself time to see if I could handle it. Today is the day and I feel too much anxiety at the moment to do it :( If it was just hanging out 1 on 1, I'd be down but I'm too rusty and am afraid of making a fool of myself. I think I have 4 friends I trust somewhat to hang out with once in a while. Since its been a while since I had really close friends, I had that fear of hanging out too much with people I like who will figure out how messed up I am.    I think ranking situations by how much anxiety I have is like this:  1. Going out to an event by myself and interacting with strangers who know nothing about me.  2. Hanging out with people a kinda trust already 1 on 1.  3. Hanging out in groups with some people I know and some people I don't know.  4. Opening up and letting folks know about AVPD who I consider friends but I still hide things from.  5. Romantic relationships where I have to be open, vulnerable, and trusting. (LUL the dream).   My Goal for this week is to do either 1 or 2 at least one time.  Only recently have I tried the moderation path of working through things. I was all or nothing in my actions and mentality (another characteristic of Avpd?) which lead to me doing nothing for 4 years after my breakdown.  I think consistent effort, not giving up if I make a mistake or can't do what I said, and positive self-talk will really be key to making progress. And of course facing what I've been avoiding :)    I guess this is enough for now. I have a lot of things and areas of my life that I'm avoiding which has lead to a crappy situation. I'll write more about that another time. I'll try writing a post every 7-10 days, but don't judge me too hard if I miss it! This was helpful for me to clarify somethings and I feel better for writing. I hope you are doing well on your journey, fellow AVPD'ers.   - LT

Le-Tap	Just posted my first update on my challenges :D
Le-Tap	It took a long time before I even started trusting my therapist and even longer before I realized they cared and were really on my side. If a therapist you start with seems to know what they are saying and you can somewhat get along with, give them a chance. Once you feel like you want to quit, make sure you to say that you feel like you aren't being helped anymore or that it feels like they don't care, you'd be surprised to see what conversations come out of it. Hell, maybe they can show you that they do care. 
Le-Tap	I don't know that much about Schema but I've been in therapy with 1 person for about 3 years now and it has helped a lot. Before when I just accepted I needed help and needed to go to therapy, I kept switching therapist b/c they could only help with one or two things. I had one therapist help me through my grieving stage of my depression. Another help me with understand depression and thought patterns that lead to feeling like crap. Etc etc, but for Avpd, it is important to trust the therapist and even create a real relationship with them in therapy to work through issues. At least that's my experience. Find a therapist that you might be willing to trust a bit more with your issues, and slowly go down that path and you should be able to work through more anxiety issues b/c you are exposing it at least in therapy. 
Le-Tap	Blogging about AVPD? | Has anyone been blogging about their challenges and successes battling AVPD? I'm finally feel better after being sick for a few months and wanted to write about all the things I've been avoiding as I work out of this hole I'm in. Would this be valuable to anyone else? 
Le-Tap	I have the same exact problem. I thought it was a memory problem. If I open the tabs icon and remove everything except the audio I'm listening to, it plays fine.   There was an update today i got to 7.1.1 that might also help. Hopefully you get that update soon.
Le-Tap	You are the hero we needed.
Le-Tap	I remember getting some errors when updating the launcher. What version launcher do you have? It should be 2.02.02 something like that. It might be trying to update the launcher, reset and download the newest launcher?   Can you download the fresh files from the reddit thread. and delete the files you have?
Le-Tap	sometimes installing a new comp, errors come up. I installed windows 7 from 10 and I can't launch the game anymore even though my system is powerful enough. Try installing Direct X, Mircosoft C++ Studio, or Java and see if it helps.  
Le-Tap	You got a ton of new land and types of enemies to face. More skills and classes. More Grand Missions, Extreme Missions, and Clan related activities. Its fun until it isn't. So enjoy the new content then take a break again ;D
Le-Tap	Domo arigatou
Le-Tap	it will resize it to what it wants. I can't custom zoom and lock in the angle. I'm say the netflix app is good but not as usable as the youtube app.
Le-Tap	yeah I've done that. I don't like the grey background. And if you move your head even a little, the window box will move. Also you cannot zoom in and out like the youtube app.
Le-Tap	It sucks that I can't lay while looking at the ceiling to watch videos like in youtube. The options on the netflix app doesn't darken the screen and is connected to motion accellerator 
Le-Tap	I have the same problem. I even pay for Youtube Red so I thought I wouldn't get Ad related playback errors. I guess once a day restarts are needed now?
Le-Tap	1 Hour+ SpoilerCast For Death's End - Cixin Liu Video | Hey Everyone,  After finishing death's end by cixin liu just recently, I loved it so much that I had to talk about it to someone. So I collaborated with the LibroBrothers and made a Spoilercast video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0yCsao6VrE  I loved all 3 books. The 3rd book came out September 21 this  year. Originally coming out in China in 2010.   Here are the books on goodreads:  https://www.goodreads.com/series/189931-remembrance-of-earth-s-past  I hope you guys enjoy our discussion.   Xoxo  Mr. Letap
Le-Tap	Loved the first book. Felt excited Rendezvousing with Rama <_< >_>
matrioshka_dievushka	Still here. Got so drunk I passed out so I didn't kill myself. I woke up in a shitty hostel. With a huge bump on my forehead. I didn't even know how that happened. I have lost 10 pounds in one week. I can't. I'm seeking help. | 
matrioshka_dievushka	I'm just SO SAD 
matrioshka_dievushka	It's ok guys I tried to make my life something worthy  But the truth is i am a piece of shit Drinking and killing myself right now I'm ready for death
matrioshka_dievushka	I think I have never been more determined But I will write something here before I go tonight 
matrioshka_dievushka	Still  I still have like eight hours till I finish my shift I will lock myself with some alcohol and some razors. It's over it's finally over.
matrioshka_dievushka	I tried escaping my Nmom and now my son has been taken away from me, they are trying to portray me as a bad mother and I can't go on | I have booked a hotel for tonight to kill myself after work   My only motivation was my son and now his father won't let me see him   Thank you all for being so amazing  I will think of your love in my final hours  Please don't try to talk me out  It's time 
matrioshka_dievushka	My bag is packed. Thank you for everything Mother. | I do not know the acronyms for many of the words that are used in this sub but I totally understand what they mean. I just don't remember and I will try my best to use them if not please forgive me.  I have a very bad relationship with my mother. She goes on to love me to hate me in a second. She has sabotaged many of my relationships or even school applications. Ever since I can remember I feel her hate and her incredible need of clinging to me. Sometimes she refer to me as her mother and yes, I have been mothering her far too long.  She would go to extremes to damage my reputation and seems angry when someone cares for me. She has threatened me to take my son, she insults me infront of him, all the like.  Between her and my ex narcissistic boyfriend my life has been a train wreck. My anxiety and depression being off the roof. Attempting suicide and somehow being blamed for every little damn thing that happens.  She has left me isolated in her home cos I had nowhere to go. Left me without food and knows perfectly well I don't drive but she leaves the car keys and say hey there you go. I had another attempt last week after a guy basically raped me and took my tips of that day. Post is on depression sub about that.  Now she has told all my family, that hates me of course, that she doesn't stay home because I abuse her. Meaning as in physical and verbal violence. This was the last straw. I blocked my really abusive family and proceeded to plan my moving out of this place. I have a full time job but now I am creaking out because I had a fallout with a client and I work my butt off in that company. I hardly eat, I drink and picked up tobacco again. This woman is going to kill my mind and body. It's not going to be easy. But I have a week to sort out my new home. My bag is packed. My son's family has been very supportive and a former in law is letting me stay for a week so I can take my son tomorrow for his first day of school and sort this new project.  I am afraid but I can't do this anymore. So goodbye mother and thank you for everything. I am breaking your chains today.  Edit: Thank you for the Gold dear stranger ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much  ❤️ I live in fear of everything. Nothing's been good but I have a small hope my life can change.
matrioshka_dievushka	Alcohol Meds Cigarettes  Music Playing the guitar  Reading  Watching silly videos
matrioshka_dievushka	I only feel alive when I drink and can't wait to go to sleep and forget about my life | Well basically that's it I don't expect anything by sharing this post It won't change anything  It would make people judge me more or less and that's fine Nothing is right and I am losing my patience. I am a functional person. But behind I only feel good when I drink and how numb my legs get when I drink and how good I sleep This nightmare seems more tolerable  Nothing is the same since my ex went away. Everybody hates me. I'm nothing. Just a waste of space and I have come to terms with that  It's fine 
matrioshka_dievushka	Tried to kill myself again last night, after abused by a guy. Woke up to two police officers and doctors in my living room. My best friend saved me. | Here we are together. Just finished breakfast. Food tastes good today.   Edit:  My friend has been taking care of me all day. Was with me at the hospital, cooked lunch and stayed on the couch with me. Let me sleep and we watched Game of Thrones. When I wrote him I never really expected what happened. I guess I got used to nobody caring about me. After an unfortunate encounter with a guy I thought I was safe with I just broke down. Ever since my last relationship ended my life and my mind have never been the same.  Sure I have now a job I really like. But there is a lot of pressure and colleagues haven't been making things any better nor easier. This have been one of the roughest months I've ever had. Not even in January when I almost went through with it completely. I've been working non stop and have no support at home.  I fear when I write down these things, the things that worry and bother me. Because I know people have it way worse, because maybe I sound stupid and dramatic. But this is the truth.  I felt so drained and distressed last night that I just passed out and tried to end it again. I don't want to enter in details because I don't want to trigger anyone. My friend is my only friend I have. We started our friendship months ago. I never thought he would do this for me. I know that this is a new excuse for my mother to paint me as the usual looney black sheep that she has to endure. She is away on a long holiday, she hasn't even bothered to call me. Just tell all my family about my problems so she can be the victim. She sent me some videos about religion. I've had it with all of this. I just hope tomorrow is better. I have decided to not take anyone's shit anymore. I really need to get well but this time for real. I relapsed. I can't help to be human. I fight my depression every day, every hour and every minute. Sometimes it feels like too much. This is clearly not the way to go. It's the only coping mechanisms I have acquired in my life. I am learning to use others not so destructive. I am aware of my situation.  Thank you all for your kindness. ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	I fucked up, planning my death | I fucked up. I crashed my moms car, nothing serious just a corner and is now at the workshop. I can pay for the fix up. My ex tried to get back together, I had moved on and now he won't forgive me for the things I've done. I want to Kill myself. When me mother sees the car she is gonna kill me. Everyone hates me. I feel like a slut. I won't make it this week. I am going to kill myself.
matrioshka_dievushka	I crashed trying to park inside my house. She hates me and now this is going to be the end of the world.
matrioshka_dievushka	THANK YOU, kind and young stranger. First of all I'm very sorry you hurt and cut yourself. Actually I was a very huge cutter way back, almost half of my life ago. The scars have healed over time and now are almost not noticable. Sometimes I relapse but try not to beat myself so much about it.  You are very right about my mother, if I have stayed is because I wanted to help her with my job and company. But she doesn't need at all the second. When she said that yesterday, she was so disgusted and frustrated I was in shock. I realised that there was really no bond between us. I don't trust her. It was very painful to see this woman who supposedly gave birth to me could hurt me so much. She implied I was a whore and that if i could have a job and friends (finally) I could seek out my way to work just as I find men. It was degrading and I'm trying to tell it as much educated I can cos in reality it sucked.  I told her as soon as I got my first pay check I would leave. That would be in a week. She started giving me solutions like if nothing had happened. I was crying in anger and anxiety. I am tired. I've been playing this sick game with her and I'm done. I am trying to stay positive in this situation but sometimes my world crumbles. Too much pressure. Too much anxiety too much pain and hatred.
matrioshka_dievushka	No prob :) always here to listen.
matrioshka_dievushka	"I'm tired of listening that I have to do things for you just because you are my daughter" | Please help me.  I just got my first full time job after struggling with a strong depression and anxiety.  I live with my mother, which despises me. No matter what I do everything I do is wrong.   I posted a while ago here about her. I'm sorry I can't recall the abbreviations for terms. My mother is a cold, bitter person.  I have a child and live with her because of no choice. Now I'm finally seeing the exit of this hellhole.   She has told me she is tired of helping me, though she is never home and has left me starving many times here. I live isolated so I can't go anywhere without a car. I don't have a license.   I am exhausted from working but I still have to wait for my first pay. She has done everything in her power to sabotage this. She does this with relationships as boyfriends and my family.   She told me I should go to work (she has taken me once) like I look for men (not sure what that meant) and infront of my child.  I broke down, she is acting as if nothing happened. I really feel I will die if I stay here. I stood up for the first time in a long time. She was frozen and is now on WhatsApp talking. Like I don't exist. I had a nervous breakdown. I'm lost in this situation. No matter what I do it's never good and I'm very tired and kinda regretting my suicide attempt in January didn't worked.  I'm destroyed. 
matrioshka_dievushka	Yes! It is very cool indeed  Though is a lot of work and I'm really tired. When I arrive to nice places I can even have time for myself. I am finding my way again. I am discovering myself and being at ease. I still struggle with my depression and anxiety but now feel productive and busy. Things will get better.  :) ❤️❤️❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Yeah baby yeah (Austin Powers) I love that movie
matrioshka_dievushka	That's amazing! Congratulations! Embrace this moment and enjoy it to the max ❤️❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Believe me, if I could anybody can do it. I've been in a very very dark place. Staying numb on the couch and drinking my emotions away. Every day I tried to do something about it, some days I failed. But there's hope, and there's nothing more satisfying than proving all wrong and that you can actually make something or achieve something by yourself. Go for it. ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! It feels lit for sure!!! Been celebrating for two days! :)
matrioshka_dievushka	Thanks :) 🙌
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much. I also believe this will be a part of recovering and somehow achieving small milestones day by day. Sure some days will be difficult but I feel stronger now to take life. :)
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! I can't believe it still! :) ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Why you wish you were dead? If need to talk I'm here if needed. 
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much 😊 
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! I don't want to give away so much information but I get to travel, almost everyday. My mood has incredibly improved since. I can't believe it. ❤️🌹
matrioshka_dievushka	Yayyyyy :)
matrioshka_dievushka	No rain at all and that advice is very much appreciated believe me :) I definitely need to save for some upcoming projects. Thank you so much for your words, I will treasure this victory! ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Exactly! That moment is amazing. It was very difficult searching and being rejected constantly. But when that moment comes, everything will be worth it. Nobody believed in me so I'm proud of myself.  Don't worry, just be persistent, and if someday you feel low it's completely normal. Don't give up. Everything is going to be fine. ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Well I guess I'll have to check well before posting. I was referring to depression not at all to any of other kind of political job. But thanks!  :) 
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much. Good luck on your hunt and let me know how it goes! First time is always a bit nerve wracking but don't worry, everything is going to be fine. 🌹
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you :)
matrioshka_dievushka	That's very sweet and no weird at all. Thank you kind stranger, sending my best to you as well. ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! And congratulations on your job! :) I'm also nervous but I'm trying to take it easy on me. Don't worry! You'll do fine! 
matrioshka_dievushka	I got a job | My first full time job. Great pay. Lots of effort and sacrifice but it's worthy. I'm happy and feel satisfied. I have mayor depression and anxiety. So this is a big deal for me. I am willing to make it through.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! This definitely calmed me down.  I have struggled a lot to get to this point. What makes it dreamy? Well all the wonderful places and the fact I will be travelling every day, is amazing. I love to travel and now I can finally do it. Also to get to work with people, be nice and polite. It's not going to be easy but I can always try.  The pay is very good, which means I could finally move out of my mums place.  Where as my kid, he totally understands, besides we don't have his fathers support so me being the whole provider is very important. It's tiring to travel every day but this is the chance I have been waiting.  I get anxious because I live with a very dominant mother and everything I do is terrible in her eyes. She is not supportive and I live in the middle of nowhere. So the main issue is finding the way to get to my job and back home safe because there's not much public transportation. She has left me weeks starving here while she was at the beach. Every time I land a job she gets furious and says I'm doing that to spite her. And that I am selfish.  I attempted suicide in January. My ex had left me again and I didn't see a way out. Two weeks ago he left me again and I've been struggling between drinking and crying and feeling miserable.   I finally feel better. But the fears crawl up. Like a snake that tells me that I'm not good enough and that I am going to mess everything up.  That's basically it. 
matrioshka_dievushka	Got my dream job, super anxious now | Hey guys  I post usually here or on depression sub.  I had a job interview last week. This is the job of my dreams. I get to travel and meet people and the pay is very very good. I can't believe it to the point now I'm anxious about it. Would I be good at this?  And what about my kid? I will have to sacrifice a lot of our time together. But this is my first full time job. We need the money. I have been unemployed for over eight months. This is what I am capable of doing. I have many odds against me but I feel this is the time to let go my fears. Specially those of being a bad mother.  I have been feeling better with my depression and anxiety. I take a new medication and been working out. I have been moving on from my previous relationship and heartbreak.  I just feel anxious to mess everything up.  Help
matrioshka_dievushka	I hear you OP.  Same for me. I can't move on and I thought we will be together for ever.  It hurts and I'm sorry for your pain. I know I can't make this feelings stop but I can tell you how to not think about it. Try to do something that takes your mind off this subject. Something you like, something just for you. Just because this happened that doesn't mean there is something wrong with you at all. You are worthy and I'm sure you have all these amazing qualities.  Grieving is part of the process. As days pass everything will start to feel better. We all have our time and our process. Take all the time you need. I'm no one to say anything but, don't do it OP. Believe me, it's not worthy.  I'm here whenever you need to talk.  Love,  Matrio 
matrioshka_dievushka	Hey OP,  I'm very sorry for how you are feeling right now. I am almost the same age as you and am struggling with a breakup as well.  Right now seems like the end of the world but believe me it's not. It's never too late to do something or meet people. And you are very young! All my "friends" are also married/engaged/pregnant but hey, that's life. Maybe now you can focus on doing something you really like. It's absolutely fine to be selfish in this sense and think of your wellbeing.  Many things besides this relationship drove me to attempt in january. It was not worthy at all.   Be strong.   Lots of love ❤️ 
matrioshka_dievushka	Glad you are still here OP.  You took the best decision for yourself and that takes a lot of courage. Big hugs to you.   <3
matrioshka_dievushka	Got a job interview and another city and started Pristiq | I finally got a job interview (in another city) This is something I can do well It seems too good to be true but I have nothing to lose.  I started Pristiq today and have been a little sleepy but I feel it's the beginning of feeling better.  I have seen my ex is moving on and I was getting really sad about this but I am looking forward to whatever may come. I have all odds against me but I have nothing to lose.
matrioshka_dievushka	I'm glad you made it through.   I can really relate to your feelings towards love and relationships. Don't beat up yourself any more about what happened. It was a personal choice and no one has really an idea of what goes through someone's head when he or she decides to end it all. I'm sorry you went through this.  Big hugs and stay strong. You can do this.  ❤️
matrioshka_dievushka	Hello!  Congratulations on the weight loss and quitting smoking! It's so hard to do but now that you decided you have to stay strong about it.  Gaining weight is common when you quit. I have decided to quit also, it's been two days but I feel good atm. I've been smoking many many years and I feel miserable after I do it.  I try to do something better for myself when I want to smoke. If I'm hungry have a fruit or are just anxious try to lay down and breathe and relax. Excersise helps a lot. There are a lot of apps to train by yourself and they are very encouraging.   Just hang in there! Your body will adjust.  Good luck!   :)
matrioshka_dievushka	I apologise is this is not the right sub. Need help with this situation between me (F31) and my Nmom | Like I said, I apologise if this is not the right sub.  I have been reading a lot here lately and can't seem but to relate immensely to the stories and my heart goes out to all of you that have had to endured so much abuse.  Whenever I read that you did well and went no contact it's a victory over these horrible behaviours, you have my deep respect and admiration.  So my mother, I would like some insight on what you guys think about this behaviour:  We live together for over two years. And my small kid.   We have a history of a bad and toxic relationship. But I saw myself with no home nor job and had to move in.  I am told constantly I am not good enough and am a bad mother. I had a recent job and everything was perfect, she was happy and money was not something to worry about.  I also got some extra income and was able to spoil her and buy her clothes, pay debts, etc. We were happy, she was happy.  I've been in a terrible relationship with a man I suspect is a narcissistic too. After a year of being together I have zero self esteem. My mind is broken and my dignity left a long time ago.  She is always angry towards me.  After my ex left me for fifth or sixth time (I don't know, I lost count) in January I tried to kill myself. The amount of pressure and hate and loneliness just was too much.   I figured since I'm such a screw up why not just end it. First thing she did at the hospital was call my child's family and now they think I'm a monster. They ignore me and have stated they could take my child any time. I asked why she did this, my mother said she thought I was not going to make it.  When I left the hospital she was very angry. She wanted me to stay and somehow everything was about her pain and embarrassment about what had happened. I'm so happy the mental health team got to interview me first and her after before my release. They believed in my recovery but my mother she is waiting the moment I finally cross that line.  I am responsible, I have only worked and stayed home. I love my child and take care of this home. I help in every possible way I can. There's nothing good I can do to please her. And when I cry it makes her even more angry. She says it's very irritating and to grow the hell up.  Where I live, I'm isolated from the outside world. No public transportation and I can't drive.   My kid is away and she is too. I have spent a week without practically any food. And I can't buy my medicines (depression and anxiety) because there's no way of going to a pharmacy.   She said she needed to rest and some space. I told her I could starve but not my child and she said that if the kid was here which I responded not and she said so what's the problem.  I felt the urge to tell her that if she even cared that me, her daughter, was starving and sick (I've been stomach sick and have arrhythmia from anxiety), but I figured this would only start more conflict and just remained silent.   She never hugs me, or offers caring advice. She's says I fuck up time after time and she didn't know how to help me and was seeking outside help. Not sure what that meant. Sure it is to everyone hate me even more and she is the victim.  Is it justified the way she acts even if I'm 31? I am the only girl of two brothers and the older sister. They are perfect in her eyes. I am the perfect excuse to point the finger at and laugh and feel sorry for her.   I could go on forever...  Please forgive me for this being so long and if you got up to here I thank you for reading this.
matrioshka_dievushka	Why nobody loves me? Why I'm so alone | My heart physically hurts I am wasting away in this darkness and despair Nobody cares  Nobody is willing to listen or lend a hand  My hands shake. I physically feel my heart is breaking   This life is a sick game and I'm getting tired   I'm so tired I don't know what else to think or do
matrioshka_dievushka	I am very happy to know you are ok and didn't hurt yourself. I'm proud of you. That's not an easy thing but you did and made it through.  You are very strong.  Art is perfect to explore feelings and release stress. What kind of art do you like?  Try not to think any more about the benzos. Now think about you and to get well.  Go and get those spray cans! This is good therapy :) art is always good.  My day, it's ok. Trying to stay positive.  I am very happy to see your response. I really am. 
matrioshka_dievushka	How are you OP?
matrioshka_dievushka	Hey there OP.  I'm very sorry you are going through this situation. I've been in the same place as you many times. Most recent was Friday.  I don't have any answers to life and I can't tell you there's going to be some magical event that will make everything better. Life is hard and I think you have suffered enough. Never forget though, that you can always make that change for yourself, and once you get clean from all the drugs your mind will start becoming more clearer.  Don't be so hard on yourself. Everyone struggles and I really want to listen to you.   Would like to talk? I'm here to listen.
matrioshka_dievushka	Of course  Rest <3
matrioshka_dievushka	I understand, Wanna talk about it?
matrioshka_dievushka	Why is that? What's troubling you? 
matrioshka_dievushka	I could go on for a very long time. And you?
matrioshka_dievushka	I totally get you! :)
matrioshka_dievushka	Never forget, YOU are the only one that can change your reality, you can do this.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you for your condolences.  So you relapsed, so what? It happens to many of us that are/we're addicted, Don't beat yourself about it. It's fine and completely understandable, you are human.  How are you feeling now? Have you taken anything? 
matrioshka_dievushka	I will go and walk in a while Lenin is here by my side while I play the guitar (I'm not good but it feels good) :)
matrioshka_dievushka	No 💔
matrioshka_dievushka	That sucks. I'm sorry you experienced that. Seems some mothers are experts in making us feel like garbage.  I can't move out YET. I am very positive on finding my own place and a decent job, even if my circumstances are absolute crap I know I will get the hell away from here.  This just reinforces my theory about my mother.  It's ok. I would really like that. Cheesecake though.
matrioshka_dievushka	I live with her.  But hey, that cheesecake would be heaven right now!!!!  :)
matrioshka_dievushka	<3OP<3  It's ok to cry. It releases our emotions. I am a "little" crybaby. My mother hates it. I can relate on having a difficult mother. No matter what you are feeling right now or have experienced you must know and remember, those things don't define you. You are valuable and deserve to be happy.  I was going to mention the age gap but didn't know if it was correct to do so. Of course it's difficult to relate for you!!! It's absolutely normal. You talk about him like he is really special. You are lucky OP. I wish I could say my father loved me. He passed away some years ago, very young. From cancer. It was incredible agressive and horrible and he had an incredible painful death. We said goodbye over the phone before he went on full morphine and methadone to kill his pain. It was one of the most difficult things I ever had to experience even though he was not a good father. I forgave him. It's ok.  Hey I am with my headphones right now! And when I forget them I'm crushed!   Addiction is very difficult. I drink from time to time and I believe alcohol is a very destructive legal drug. I really have to get a hold on myself when things go bad. Like right now, everything is bad and fucked up. I'm just trying to stay calm.  Have you thought about quitting? I know it's VERY hard but hey, nothing's impossible. I do know what you mean when the addiction rewards you, it's your best friend, it's your lover, your family. But all of that is a lie OP. There's no true escape for true life. And you will be sucked into this cycle more and more. Try one day at a time as much corny that may sounds.  "I accept the things I cannot change" (NA and AA) that sure sounds stupid right now but it's some kind of mantra. When you get it you will be free. Why not do it for you OP? There's a lot out there you can find that makes you happy. A nice girl and good friends. Why not??? I see the most ridiculous and awful people have amazing spouses and friends and jobs. We deserve that too!!! I demand our good things!!  So yes we have problems. That doesn't mean I don't deserve to be happy. You know, I was mercilessly bullied in school. Even sexually abused by classmates. It has taken me long to realise those people don't define me. If people think I'm such a shit well now I'm gonna show you I am alive and kikcking and if that upsets you too bad mate.   What I have learned from society is that there are people out there that really enjoy when others suffer and have problems. Because it makes them feel good about themselves. Fuck those people!  You can do this, I believe in you! And hey, I also have a shower playlist and I lip sync the hell out of that playlist!!!!!  What kind of music do you like?  I hope you are feeling better.  Hugs!
matrioshka_dievushka	I confronted my mother. Extremely isolated, with my thoughts. | Hey guys.  So, bit of backstory. I live isolated, I have been depressed since they gave me antidepressants fifteen years ago. Take anxiety medication since six years ago due to an abusive and traumatic relationship. I am unemployed and live with my mother and small child. I've never had money issues, this is a very dark time for me.   I've been in a relationship for more than a year with a person I completely adored. He has left me multiple times and caused severe psychological scarring in my mind. I have zero self esteem.  I tried to kill myself in January. I get a lot of shit for this and it makes me angry. I survived and been fighting to stay positive. Being with my mother is horrible. She is cold and cruel. Sometimes she behaves erratically and talk to people about me just to hurt me. She has never been a mother really. And is super angry all the time, she even intended to maintain contact with my ex and I was like wtf mom what the hell are you doing. She says I'm way dramatic and to suck it up. To grow the fuck up. I am constantly told I'm a shit person.  So, my child is away with his dad and my mom is also away. I've been discarded finally by this guy on Friday and it broke my heart and my world. I locked myself in the laundry room so that she or my son couldn't see me cry. She HATES it when I cry. Like it bothers her seriously.  We haven't spoke in days. I live isolated. I can't even go to a pharmacy cos literally this is the middle of nowhere. I practically have no food.  My strategie with her lately was agreeing on everything she says. She called me and said she didn't know when she was coming back. Very very angry.  I listened to her anger, I told her I had no intention to bring this upon her. That I worry and I don't feel happy about my situation. She then said all I this was fuck it up time after time. So I gave her a list why that's not true and that all I did was love a person and hold on to him like life cos my existence is desperate. I also listed all the things I have done to help around but, she just doesn't give a fuck.  She told me that I behave so weird. That I'm not normal. That she is gonna seek external help, so I asked her if she was talking about a mental institution. (They got me in one when I was underage. Because of anorexia and drug use) and she said no I was not talking about that and I said well it sure seems like it. I told her I was sick, that depression is a disease. That sure some environmental factors come to the diagnosis but also neurological and chemical applied. I reminded her I take medicine, and that I suffer.  She then said oh well I want you to be relaxed whatever.  I hung the phone in tears. That conversation really has me fucked up.
matrioshka_dievushka	It's ok OP, I am here with you.  You must now how bad all that combination is. Is something and I'm sorry, if it's not good but, is there some moment that you think in your life that triggered the opiate addiction?  As a former addict (cocaine) I know you are hurting and just want the pain to go away. To not feel cos everything is too much to handle. Dear stranger, believe me when I say you are strong and brave. Just being here still proves it and pouring your heart on this sub.  I'm sorry about the bullying you had to endure. People are horrible but there are also some good souls out there. No one deserves that, and those people are truly assholes for being cruel to your circumstances. Fuck those people, they don't define you.  You say you have a loving dad. That's amazing and very important. No matter what you must know he loves you and adores you! He has given you everything because he loves you and you deserve it!  So ok, we all have problems. That doesn't make you a bad person. I really admire people that say this is who I am and I am in pain. It's disgusting the amount of bigoted people I have to encounter and I hate it.  Now what I recommend is trying to relax a bit. Don't mix the stuff, it is very dangerous, let's try and focus on something you like. What do you do? What do you like? Tell me about yourself.  Sending you peace and a hug right now
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you Redditors. You are amazing. | [removed]
matrioshka_dievushka	Thanks everyone <3  I thank you so much. I am here for you whenever needed.  Love you 
matrioshka_dievushka	It's ok. Feeling much better now. I know I don't derserve this. So I'm finally letting go. I never thought I could do it but I have let him go of my mind and my heart. It's like he died in my mind. No need for crying over people that don't care about you. I've been relaxing and not drinking. I am alone here but I believe I can make it in this world. I don't care if I don't have support. Now I'm focused on my life, my beautiful son, and the few people that care for me.
matrioshka_dievushka	My cat hasn't left my side. | He is so amazing. I have drink a bottle of wine and have one more to go. Being drunk keeps me from doing anything right now. But my cat, Lenin, he is just the best.
matrioshka_dievushka	You are right I can only think of humans as disgusting creatures. I will protect him.
matrioshka_dievushka	I love him. 
matrioshka_dievushka	My ex. Only person I trusted.
matrioshka_dievushka	Crying right now  How come a stranger can see my worth? Your words are really comforting in this moment  I am willing to go on talking
matrioshka_dievushka	Please, I am willing to listen; I am on the edge but believe me, I can care and believe I can help you  Tell me what's going on 
matrioshka_dievushka	It's ok  I thank you from the bottom of my heart You are amazing 
matrioshka_dievushka	Please don't. I have no other chance but I bet you are a wonderful caring person. I have just ended my hopes and am far too old to continue. I tried with poison in January and it was horrible, mainly cos I survived. Please, I am fucked up but I am willing to listen. 
matrioshka_dievushka	You have a chance. Please don't follow my words or example.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you. That's very kind. I try to believe good things but everything falls apart.
matrioshka_dievushka	Not much to tell Just a broken woman Drinking 
matrioshka_dievushka	They are expensive
matrioshka_dievushka	Hey there Just state that I'm clean and haven't done an illegal drug in a long time But, I've been in Ibiza and believe me you will get offered drugs everywhere. We would get offered in every corner. Please be safe. I didn't purchase so I don't know the risk but please be very careful and around people you know.
matrioshka_dievushka	I did, last night. Took trazadone and Ativan. Woke up 10 hours later. Not feeling better. Just far more triggered and alone. Nothing changes. I really believe they will be better off without me, no one cares and people are tired of listening to your pain. Have a couple of more hours till it gets dark. I think the poison has many chances of failing so I guess I'm going through hanging myself in the garden. There's a nice tree and at night you can see all the stars. I will clean the house and get more alcohol. Get the rope set and jump. I believe these people will be happy with this outcome.
matrioshka_dievushka	It's ok I'm still up and planning to do so until I pass out If u want pm me I'm here for you 
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you!
matrioshka_dievushka	They tell me I'm the problem. To grow up. 
matrioshka_dievushka	I (31F) started this relationship a little over than a year ago with this person (48M). He seemed like my prince in shiny armour as much corny that sounds. Strong, athletic, good job (coach for the national team in important sport) cult and smart. Seemed like a fairytale for a low class woman like myself. I've been in private schools and colleges but currently am unemployed and am the lowest of the low of the social scale. This person seemed very fixated with me and I felt the need to tell him who I was and where I come from. (Drugs, dangerous environment, violent hometown, just in conclusion not a perfect person). He left me that weekend. After having countless sex encounters and me refusing. I was devastated. We kept on going for a while, me unexplainable falling in love for this person. Cos when we were together I felt on top of the world. He just can't understand anxiety and depression. I come from a broken home and a very hard history of abuse. He left me on New Year's Eve, in a train station, in a bar in the middle of the night in a foreign city because I was talking to some other girls, I am heterosexual and have no problem in saying if I was a lesbian. I'm proud of this movement and always support the community. I've been in tournaments, helped him at work, with his second divorce, his children, etc. If I have a good time with his friends he would tell me I was a drunk and an embarrassment. Never did anything of that nature to give him reasons to think that. Last time we got back together I was happy but scared he would leave again. He did it yesterday after telling me he loved me and to trust him. I clearly expressed my anxiety because of the previous abandonment. He said everything was going to be fine. He stopped calling and texting only to tell me he didn't want to get upset. I called him in tears, he told me to get myself together and suck it up, and that we will talk later. He switched off his phone. Next morning I told him if we could talk he said nope, I'm done with you and there's nothing I can do for you. I had an anxiety attack. He blocked me after telling me to leave him alone. My son is currently with his father and my only family which is my mother is away cos she needs to think about herself and be happy. I tried to kill myself in January. Had a very painful recovery. I hoped for him to visit me in the hospital: I never intended to survive but after breakup number five or six I hoped for his mercy. Now I am at the same spot: have enough alcohol, poison, razors and a rope to hang myself. Tried reaching out to friends and him also. No answer. I feel destroyed. I have a car, should I kill myself on the highway? No, no innocent people should suffer for my mistakes. My sons family have stated clearly that they could have taken my son away when I attempted. I don't stand a chance. I'm a screw up. Just for worrying for a relationship and caring for others. There's no hope. I've been humiliated in every possible matter. I think I'm ready to give up now.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you. I hope to find peace. Pain is too much.
matrioshka_dievushka	Final words | I am writing my goodbye notes. Having my last beer and sitting with poison infront of me. Why should I stop? It's the best in the end for everyone.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you.  You are very kind and I really am grateful for your heartfelt response. I truly believe everything you say and you are so right about the feeling of being scared. I am scared of life. That's the truth. I bought some beers and just had a nice warm shower. I feel a bit at peace. I am not going through my plan. It won't solve anything. I just feel very disappointed and betrayed at some point. I feel also entitled to feel paranoid about this relationship. After one year of being discarded and humiliated time after time, hearing that it won't happen again and that you are protected and safe, only to be left alone again knowing perfectly well your struggles and pain, how can you not fear it will happen again? I trusted him and felt good in his company. I thought him being almost in his 50's gave him some kind of understanding and empathy. I expressed clearly my paranoia and fears to him. My anxiety and depression. Everything. He doesn't care. Nobody cares. Everyone says stop being a victim. I don't like being a victim but I feel truly violated mentally and physically. He said by text, there's nothing I can do for you, I have no interest in fixing anything and I don't want to be with you. Then proceeded to block me. Which I find very irritating and immature. I am a grown person, why can't you talk to me on the phone at least and tell me what's going on? I can listen and understand. I've had to let go very important people in my life. I believe I am a good person. This behaviour just makes it more painful. Like if I was some nut case and hopeless being. He told me I drove everyone around me insane.   I've been through many difficult things in my life. Abused at school and by a cousin. By the father of my child. I've lost pregnancies and been in a lot of emotional pain. I have never felt love by anyone in my family. I don't have a father, he passed away. He was one of the main reasons I left my hometown. Our last conversation face to face was that I had to leave, that nobody loved me and that I should do whatever the fuck I wanted with my life and to not go to his funeral. Years later he developed cancer and had a very painful death. We said goodbye over the phone, that was one of the most painful things I ever had to do. He was on morphine and other drugs, but I told him I loved him and that he had to rest. I have taken care of my siblings through that time, only to be told to go die already and vomit ( I struggle with bulimia and anorexia ) cos I was a crazy bitch. I have no contact with them. I don't want to self harm. I have scars all over my body from fifteen years ago when I started. Why should I hurt myself while nobody cares if I die or not?   My kid, he is the best. Excellent student and person. I am his world. I don't want him to grow like I did. Everything I do is for him. People like to beat me down and tell me I'm scum but I have fought from day one for him. Never asked child support or welfare. Always provided for him. Now that I'm at a bad and weak time people feel entitled to insult me, humiliate me or tell me I'm garbage. I feel it's unfair but, if people want me dead I can only think of staying alive just to make them angry. First thing my mother did when I attempted in January was call all my son's family, knowing perfectly well I could loose him. She said she thought I wouldn't survive. When I got released she was very angry, I really thinks she hates me.  Sorry this was so long. Conclusion: plans for killing myself are postponed and a bit of my background.  Love 
matrioshka_dievushka	Two weeks ago was determined to kill myself again, got encouraged via pm by a redditor. During those days I got back with my boyfriend only to be dumped again, by text, because I was worried about our relationship. I will write my will later and at night will get drunk and go through with it. | I'm done. No mistakes this time.
matrioshka_dievushka	It was a message that said that I should kill myself. Had a series of facts and links to more information. It shocked me and really didn't follow through. Then my relationship was on again and I was so happy and grateful I felt like finally life was going to be good. This person leaves me every now and then because I worry too much (I have really strong anxiety) and he doesn't understand the feeling of impending doom. He says I love you, you are beautiful etc. Then out of the blue he rejects me, tells me to leave or just don't talk to me. He left me at a train station alone tricking me saying he was going to park the car. He left. That day I attempted suicide. My life is crumbling. I am isolated. I devoted myself to this man. I helped him at work and with his family. He discards me when I'm not useful anymore. I feel humiliated and like a loser. Very sad and lonely. I've been having anxiety attacks for three days. I've really tried to make my life better but I have failed. I am a burden and I can't think of any other option for a low life like me. I've tried the rope and the technical issues for my final attempt. I don't see any exit. The pain is unbearable.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you. It means a lot you reply to my message. My son loves me. He says I'm the best mother in the world.  I am crying right now.
matrioshka_dievushka	I am an English teacher. Female, 31 years old.  I have a wonderful son, but separated from his father. He was very abusive psychologically and physically at the end. I have always worked in various jobs but am currently unemployed. I can't even afford my own place. I've been depressed since I can remember. I have attempted several times as a teenager with drugs and now as an adult with other methods. I am in a lot of emotional pain.  I have no friends, and practically no family because although I live with my mother, she is a high narcissist and hates when I cry or have a breakdown.  I am an embarrassment to society and my family.  Few things I like to do: paint, draw, excersise, have a really nice cold beer. Music is also very important to me. I like to read but currently I don't have the strength to do anything. I'm scared but kind of relieved that I can take my life finally with no mistakes.  Everyone hates me, thinks I'm a loser. I thought I had found love finally. I've been discarded at least five times in one year only to be taken back, use me for a couple of days and then dispose me as garbage. I've been crying for five hours.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you for reading my story. I believe I am a good person with millions of flaws of course. I just feel everyone would be better off without me.
matrioshka_dievushka	I hate my life. I'm useless. | I couldn't even kill myself yesterday. I was drunk enough to do it. I decided to give it one more chance. Everything is worthless. Everything is useless. I hate the person I am. I hate what I see in the mirror. Nobody cares about me. I don't know how much long I can keep up this charade. I'm pathetic and if I had a gun I would shoot myself without a doubt. I'm ugly, my face looks miserable. My hair is falling and dirty. I am in so much emotional pain I can't even begin to describe accurately what I feel. Desolation? Void?  I have been purgin for the last weeks, taking laxatives and sleeping pills. I don't have any strength in my body. I feel my mind is giving up.  I hate being me. I see no point. Maybe if I cut myself I won't go through suicide. I'm so tired. I haven't interacted with other human being in a week. I am isolated against my will and situations. This is a nightmare. I never wake up from this nightmare.
matrioshka_dievushka	<3
matrioshka_dievushka	Sorry guys I didn't went through with it I had everything set out and was ready but I didn't  Thank you for all the love 
matrioshka_dievushka	Hanging myself right now | Thank you everyone for being so amazing My journey ends here Too much pain Goodbye 
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you for your kindness. Same offer goes to you. I can't seem to get perspective though. I am alone at home and now loneliness is really hitting me. Not because of social media. But because my son left with his dad and won't be back in a couple of days. I have no energy, only to gather quarters and cents to buy beer. That's the only highlight of my day. I'm a sad pathetic person.
matrioshka_dievushka	Thank you so much! I can understand what you mean specially being pregnant. Back almost a decade I started my profile when I got pregnant and it still wasn't so negative and toxic as I believe it is now. I couldn't go through with that situation currently. I'm glad you are feeling better and thank you for the support :)  <3
LoweryFox	Does it ever get better.. | I started doing better..then something happened today that blew apart everything again..I don't think I'll ever heal from this..is it bad that now I don't see a problem of killing myself now..I just wanna die..
LoweryFox	I just don't see why..we grew up together since we were 4..I don't have anyone anymore..in reality this pushed me over the edge and I've been thinking of suicide all day..and it sounds nice bc I won't have to deal with this anymore..I won't have to feel this pain anymore..and it sounds like the only way out..
LoweryFox	About a month or so ago or so I had everything I wanted..a beautiful woman (5 year relationship) a career going and a house and so much more..but she walked out of my life and I was so distraught that I lost my job causing me to have to move out also..I never knew why she left but today she came back to me crying wanting me to take her back and I was so happy until I found out she was pregnant..by my only friend who I thought I could trust..he doesn't want the kid and I feel so betrayed..so lost..she was my first heart break..and I was doing well until today..I want to take her back but the fact she tried running off with my so thought friend and getting pregnant..I just can't even tho I do so bad..I just want to run..
LoweryFox	All I can do is lay in my bedroom..bc everytime I drive I want to flip my car..I really don't have anything left anymore..I have nothing going for me anymore, no friends to turn to..I don't think anyone will miss me now..at this point I'm just existing and I don't want to..I should be mad at what happened today but I'm just so done with my life that I can't be..
LoweryFox	I'll private message you if that's okay..
LoweryFox	I came bc I have really nothing and nobody left..I'm just so alone that it's tearing me apart. Idk what to do anymore and I need someone before this consumes me completely..in all honesty I lost everything I loved and cared about a month ago..
LoweryFox	I've been staying away from drugs and alcohol bc last time it made it worse bc I would always sober up and feel worse about it..but the past few days I've just been wanting to just take my seatbelt off and hit a tree..I've been lost and don't know what to do with myself anymore..I feel as if no one would truly be bothered..
LoweryFox	Birthday | Today was my birthday and the past week my depression has been getting worse..for the first time in years I'm thinking of suicide again..I hate feeling like this and I need someone 
LoweryFox	Really need a friend | I really don't know how to say this but I'll try my best. I've had alot happen here recently and I just need a friend or two I can message constantly back and forth and actually have conversations with and to seek out advice of how to deal with the pain and loneliness in my heart. I'm great at giving advice but when it comes to myself I'm lost..so please someone message me and please don't sugar coat..
LoweryFox	21 M looking for F (Ky) | Hi I just got out of a very long term relationship and I'm not looking for another. Just looking for a sincere friend to talk to about anything, even your deep thoughts. I just need a friend so I'm not just sitting around in my head before or after work
plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	A good friend of mine (m) broke up with one of my closest friends (f). He's talking about suicide and I don't know how to help. | Their breakup came as a surprise to everyone. Apparently she broke up with him. I don't think specifics matter that much here but then again I've never been in this situation before.   How can I help? 
plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	It's 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32 (then theoretically 50 but hasn't been observed). Due to quantum physics fuckery, after the third shell things start to get messy and sub-shells (s, p, d, f) fill up in weird order.  4s fills up before 3d, then 4p but after that 5s and 4d and so on. As it turns out, each shell's maximum is a noble gas configuration. Helium has only 1s filled, Neon has 1s, 2s, 2p filled, then Argon has 1s through 3p filled, giving it 8 outermost (valence) electrons, 2 in 3s and 6 in 3p. Krypton, the next noble gas, has 18 electrons more- 10 in 3d, 2 in 4s and 6 in 4p, giving it yet again, 8 valence electrons. Xenon adds 10 electrons to 4d, 2 in 5s and 6 in 5p. 8 valence electrons is the most stable configuration, so atoms strive for that. Sodium, for example, wants to give up its single, unstable valence electron and become +1 in order to have the electron configuration of Neon. Chlorine wants another electron to become -1 and have the electron configuration of Argon.   Hope that clears this up! If not, feel free to DM me and I'll do my best to answer.

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	Can't speak for Greek, but in Hebrew each of the 22 letters has a numeric value. It goes like 1, 2, ... 10, 20, ... 100, 200, 300, 400 so to write 21, for example, you'd need כ which is 20 + א which is 1 -> כא   This is how the Hebrew calendar counts days of the month, how we order the chapters and verses of the Bible, how we order the grades of compulsory education and so on, but it's very uncommon in things like streets and day-to-day life.   Because there are only 22 letters and none of them stand for thousands, we had to get creative, so we decided that a letter with one of these ׳ stands for that letter's value * 1000. So for the current Hebrew calendar year (5776) we write ה׳תשע״ו.  (ה = 5, ת = 400, ש = 300, ע = 70, ו = 6) These ״ are there to differentiate "numbers" and actual words.

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	So there are two types of shva: נע na "moving" and נח nach "resting". They both have the same niqqud (two vertical dots under the letter), and they usually sound a bit different, shva nach being a consonant without any vowels, and shva na being a consonant with a bit more of an /ɛ/ sound (like in elevator, dress, bet), but both can sound like each other depending on specific word and accent.  How do you differentiate between them? First, there are two rules you have to remember: a shva at the start of a word will always be a shva na, and a shva at the end of a word (if the last letter has niqqud) will always be a shva nach. If you have two shvas at the end of the word, one directly after another, they are both shva nach.  Now to the difficult bit. In order to find what type of shva it is when it is in the middle of a word, you have to change the word back to its "elementary form" צורת יסוד. For nouns צורת יסוד is the singular form without prefixes and suffixes, and for verbs it's the singular form in the specific tense the original verb was. So for example אֲנַחְנוּ אוֹכְלִים *anachnu ochlim* "we are eating" -> the צורת יסוד of אוֹכְלִים would be אוֹכֶל *ochel* (I) am eating. Notice how the khaf in אוכלים has no vowel, but in the צורת יסוד, in the verb אוכל, the khaf has an 'e' vowel. In this case, the shva in the khaf in אוכלים is **shva na**, because it originally was a vowel (= תנועה, *tnu'a* movement in Hebrew, so the shva is "moving".) If the shva originally was a shva and it hasn't changed, it's a **shva nach**. For example, in יִסְפְּרוּ *yisperu* (they) will count, both the samech and the pey have shva. We need to find the elementary form of יספרו, which is יִסְפֹּר *yispor* (he) will count. See how the shva in the samech stayed when we moved to the elementary form? Because the pey changed it's niqqud from the elementary form to the verb we are looking at, we conclude that the shva in the pey in יִסְפְּרוּ is a **shva na** (which usually sounds like more of an /ɛ/ sound, but can cause a consonant sound). Similarly but in the opposite way, because the samech has a shva in the elementary form and retains that shva in the verb we're looking at, we know the shva is **shva nach**.  The בגד כפת letters get a dagesh when they come after a shva nach. You can see that in יספרו- the samech has a **shva nach**, so the pey has a dagesh. So we say *yisperu* and not *yisferu*, and on the other hand we say כבלים *kvalim* "cables" and not *kbalim*, because the kaf has shva na (it is at the start of the word) and the bet does not get a dagesh.  I hope I was able to help! Feel free to pm me if you have any questions about Hebrew!

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	Hi there, Denden!
plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	This document is the original proposal, page 7:  There are a few ligatures which are very frequently used and are not native to Urdu but have been inherited from Arabic, for religious reasons. In Pakistan, it is required by law to begin all official govenment documents with the Bismillah ligature. However, everybody is clear that it is not Urdu, but Arabic, similar to ligatures already in the standard (e.g. FDFA and FDFB). If a person is typing Urdu, and is unfamiliar with Arabic and has Urdu (not Arabic) keyboard, it will be difficult (if not practically impossible) for the user to type this Arabic ligature. For this reason, and for the reason the two ligatures, referred to above, were introduced in the ISO standard, it is also proposed to include another ligature for Bismillah. This ligature is also part of UZT 1.01, the national standard code page of Government of Pakistan for Urdu.  TL;DR: It's an Arabic ligature commonly used in Urdu. It was added so someone using an Urdu keyboard can type it easier.  Shoutout and credit to /u/potsalium for answering this over at a /r/NoStupidQuestions thread

Also, there are some sites where you can enter a word and it will give you the word with the vowels (or nekudot). It's usually pretty accurate, but might end up confusing you more when the same consonants with different vowels give different words, kinda like "cut" and "cat", or "put" and "pot".  http://nakdan.morfix.co.il/nikud/Demo This is one I'd recommend, as it's quite simple and straightforward.

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	Yes, I am a native speaker. I should probably put a flair.  To answer your P.S.- there are six letters (abbreviated as בג״ד כפ״ת *beged kefet*) that whenever they are the first letter of a word, will always have a dagesh (in words that originate in Hebrew. So, in פילוסופיה Philosophy, which is a loan word originated in Greek, the pey does not have a dagesh). Gimel ג, Dalet ד and Tav ת historically used to be pronounced differently when they had dagesh. Tav without dagesh made a soft th sound like in 'three', for example. In modern Hebrew, however, they are pronounced the same with or without dagesh.  I hope that made it somewhat clearer!

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	You pointed out so many things I have never even thought are difficult, it's super interesting to me to hear that.   A small note about aiyn/aleph, samekh/sin, tet/tav and such: historically, all these pairs used to be pronounced differently. Since then many of these pronunciations became degenerate, and only the weird spelling remained. So yeah, that can really be confusing at times, haha.   Another note regarding bet/kaf/pey: these letters get a dagesh (b and not v, k and not kh, p and not f) when they are the first letter of a word, for example בית *bayit* house, פתוח *patuach* open (adj), כניסה *knisa* entrance. They also get a dagesh when they come after a consonant with a "shva nach", but that is more difficult to explain over a Reddit comment :D  If you have any questions regarding Hebrew I'd love to answer. You can pm me anytime if you'd like.

plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	Many people, even some who are native speakers, don't know this term. As you learn and speak the language you get an intuitive feel for when א ה ו י are אם קריאה and when they are consonants.   I am interested to know, how is your Hebrew learning going? Is it difficult for you?
plfwqekgqwnrgnw75731	Mostly when you write with niqqud you will see holam haser (a dot on the top left of the letter), but when writing without niqqud the vav is often added as an "אם קריאה" *em kri'a* which is supposed to help you read the word. Aleph א, yod י and he ה can also be used as אם קריאה.

Burning_Rozes	Is it just me or dealing with my depression I don't need an entire group of people knowing how I feel.. but more like just that one person.. |

Burning_Rozes	Was I just a cure to your fucking boredom? | 
Burning_Rozes	My therapy was kinda weird.. it starts off awkwardly .. then they ask a weird question like "why are you here?" So you gotta explain to them why.. and with each problem they ask an in-depth question..  sometimes they see you every week or every 2 weeks ..my therapist told me that they didn't believe in anti depressants because it's a cycle.. once you come off them you go back to depression.. but honestly I actually needed it but they told me that's the reason they didn't want to.. your therapist becomes your best friend sorta at least that's what I heard .. mine didn't quite understand me.. and soon after I stopped. I didn't feel the need to go to someone who kept telling me one thing over and over .. I expect someone to take consideration for my feelings and not act like depression can be fixed over night

Reagan_here	I haven't, it's on my travel list though. I completely understand what you mean, there's something so freeing about being in a new place where no one knows you. I had a similar experience when I went to Peru, I was free from everything back home that was holding me back and I was able to just be myself. It didn't matter if I embarrassed myself because I'd never see these people again! That thinking enabled me to practice my Spanish and just really be happy. It's really freeing to travel alone.
Reagan_here	I could just use someone to talk to tbh | Everything in my life is sorta falling apart and I wish I was dead. I haven't seen any of my friends in three months, I guess we aren't really friends anymore seeing as I dropped off the face of the earth. I'm chronically ill so I'm always having to talk to doctors and about being sick, I haven't had a conversation that doesn't involve my illness in months, it's always "look at this new study!" or "my symptoms are flaring" or strangers asking "why do you have a cane?".   I'd really like to just have a conversation with someone about normal things. There's a cute girl in my English class I think I have a crush on and I got a 90% on my first quiz in my college trig class! Just normal young people stuff. 
Reagan_here	I don't think gender really has anything to do with how lonely you are. Maybe you need to step back and reexamine what you're saying. You start off by saying "most of your friends" well that means you have at least three friends, correct? Does that mean just because you're a male you are more lonely than a girl with no friends?   From reading your post and some of your responses, it really seems like maybe having some perspective would help you. You say that "I've seen people accomplish things the things I've tried to in half the time with half the effort", how do you know they aren't working harder than you? At most, you probably spend a few hours a week that person, you can't possibly judge their whole life based on that. Going back to the loneliness thing, it's a similar story, someone can be just as lonely in a room full of people than they would be alone in their beds.   This all is not to invalidate your feelings, feelings are irrational after all, but it's important to know when you are being irrational and to try to correct the behavior. For example, when your friends were telling you about their experience with loneliness they were trying to relate to you, to help you feel less alone, but it seems like you just disregarded their experience. Instead, try to be more emotionally open with them, recognize that you are coming from different perspectives but are experiencing the same things.
Reagan_here	Where is my will to live?
Reagan_here	I'm just laying with my cat, I think I might make some meringues. I'm not sure though because they never actually work out.
Reagan_here	I don't want to be "that person" but I have a few suggestions if that's ok! I want to say that I'm the same age as your daughter, I really understand the frustration that comes with being a sick teenager and that taking medications sucks. At my last visit with my neurologist, I finally said "this is enough, I'm done with medications" and to my surprise, there are so many other options!   The best I've found is the Cefaly, it's expensive and mildly painful, but twenty minutes of use and I'll be in tip-top shape. Relief lasts about 6 hours for me but I just use it twice in one day if I need to.   The other option I'm doing is PT. It seems weird, but is actually really helpful!   There are also a few migraine medications that tend to have few side effects, my neurologists go-to is propanol, it's technically used for high blood pressure but a lot of people find it helpful. The only thing to really worry about is low blood pressure/low heart rate, but that can be accommodated if she just ups her sodium intake.   I also want to add that you are a superstar, it is *hard* dealing with a  sick teenager, not to mention incompetent doctors on top of that. Hell, it's hard to deal with non-sick teen girls! Remeber to take care of yourself!
Reagan_here	If you love history, I totally suggest Peru. There are ruins pretty much everywhere and it has such a rich past. And of course, Macchu Picchu is as amazing as everyone says it is! If you like hiking, there's a ton of great trails you can backpack on.   I honestly hate the way that everyone always wants to go to resorts for vacation, it get's boring after two days! Come on people, get out, see the world!
Reagan_here	If a man always has to initiate the conversation, how do women make friends with other women? Or how do men become friends with other men? And do women absolutely never initiate a conversation with a man?   Also, do you actually think that every woman just has flocks of men coming up to them asking them to be friends and they just ignore whichever ones aren't cool enough? No, you can't just wait around for friends to find you, you have to be open to them and yes, initiate conversations, but that's true regardless of gender.
Reagan_here	I sure hope you've never met me before, that would be super weird. What's your favorite color?
Reagan_here	How exciting you're going to Rome! What are you most excited about?
Reagan_here	One time I ate an entire pineapple in one sitting and I could legitimately see chunks come out only 4 hours later (typically that should be 24-48 hours for reference). Granted I was also just recovering from a stomach bug so that may have played into it.
Reagan_here	I have a 12 year old cat, can confirm she's still a kitten. Just today she bit off one of my new headphone earpieces and frequently wakes me up at 3am with her zoomies. The only real difference is that she likes to snuggle a little more and has some trouble jumping onto the bed.
Reagan_here	I have EDS if you have any questions! Also totally head over to /r/ehlersdanlos ! I'm a mod so I might be a little biased, but I think we have the kindest people on reddit. 
Reagan_here	I understand, it sounds more like he was uneducated on EDS vs didn't think you had it. It's super frustrating, my first rheumatologist (who claimed EDS experience) said my skin wasn't stretchy because he could pull his skin just as far, the dude was 50 years old and full of wrinkles compared to my 15 year old self. Instead to him I just had benign hypermobility and anxiety, lol nope. Thankfully my new doctors are a ton more educated and willing to learn. 
Reagan_here	Just in case you still weren't sure of the JHS/EDS difference thing, I figured I could explain it.   JHS (now Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder) is a disorder that shares pretty much all of the symptoms of hEDS, expect it's not a connective tissue disorder. HSD can be just as severe as hEDS, they just don't have the translucent skin, easy bruising, prolapses, marfanoid habitus, stretchy skin, ect. People with HSD can have common comorbid conditions like POTS and GP. The conditions are extremely similar, the distinction is really made to help researchers narrow down the genetic cause of hEDS. 
Reagan_here	I'm fairly sure that EDS people are at a higher risk of developing early onset osteoarthritis, just because the joints are unstable and rubbing against each other wrong. The good(ish) thing about treating EDS is that you only can really treat the symptoms, regardless of if you have EDS, the treatment for arthritis of the spine is going to be (practically) the same. The only real difference would be with PT, just making sure you aren't hyperextending your spine during exercises and focusing a little more on stabilizing. It's like that for any comorbid condition of EDS, it might be helpful to ask your doctors what they would do if you didn't have EDS, that way they don't get stuck up on it.   Some people go so far as to not even seek an official EDS diagnosis, as long as you are educated on the condition and know what risks it could pose (and how to look out for them) there isn't much more benefit (medically). Although personally, I find it reassuring to have a confirmation that it is EDS and I'm not crazy. I also needed to get checked for vascular type because of some of my symptoms. 
Reagan_here	I gained 50lbs in a month from it, seriously fuck seroquel. All I could do was sleep and eat. 
Reagan_here	Definitely! I actually just made a post on /r/ehlersdanlos about this same thing [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/6yvff9/if_i_give_it_the_option_to_my_body_will_sleep_for/?st=j7kpa43v&sh=de9d0f96) Since you're new to the whole EDS thing, I suggest looking into the common comorbid conditions, mainly [POTS](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30) which is know to cause fairly severe fatigue. Some people also believe that narcolepsy is more common with EDSers, so you may want to look out for those symptoms. It could also just be because you're chronically ill.  The best news I can give you is that there is treatment for fatigue. A lot of people with severe fatigue take stimulants, including me! I take Vyvanse 20mg and it gets rid of the fog in my brain, I no longer have to take a nap every few hours and it's really cut down on my daytime sleepiness. 
Reagan_here	I'm super sorry to hear that, for some reason I just always assumed it was an easy dx, but it definitely sounds just as challenging to figure out as my genetic disorder (spent a year being told I was just a hypochondriac after my bloods came back normal, nope! Just shit collagen). I guess it's more of an invisible illness issue! I hope your treatment is going well, my mom's best friend has lupus and it's just been horrible seeing everything she's been through. Although after her last kidney transplant she's really doing well. Thankfully medications get better every year and hopefully someday it can be treated in a better manner.   Thanks for sharing your experience!
Reagan_here	If you have any questions about EDS you can ask them at /r/ehlersdanlos ! 
Reagan_here	Find a children's hospital near you that allows volunteers! Typically you can go and read books or do crafts with noncritical patients. It can be emotionally draining but it's so nice for the kids and family. It gives the parents a few minutes to step away and helps the kid to just have some fun and forget their stuck in the hospital. If you want to, you can contact "child life services" or if they have a specific division for volunteers. 
Reagan_here	I'm shocked to hear that it takes a long time to get a lupus dx, when I went to my PCP with widespread joint pain the first thing she did was run a shit ton of panels (we had to spread the blood work over two days because of the amount of vials). Is that not usually the go-to when people present with autoimmune type issues?
Reagan_here	I totally understand! Turns out I actually have a genetic disorder that half of my doctors have never heard of. Getting a diagnosis has been a pain in the ass, it's a shame that people with autoimmune diseases face the same problems

My dad moved out four years ago because his job needed him to move and he didn't want to force my sister out of her high school. I've been seeing him every two weeks since then and life has been relatively stable-ish. Things are fine as long as he doesn't come to our house, we usually meet at our beach house. Something about him being at home just makes him super pissed off and one of his surprise visits home left me in the psych ward for a few weeks.   Now all of a sudden he's sold off the company he moved for and he's being payed to not work (non competition agreement or something) and he's moving back in with me and mom. I don't know what to do, he's not going to be working so he'll get bored and make up things to yell about. Since I'm disabled I just take night classes at the community college so I'm going to have to spend all day with him and I know he's going to talk about how lazy I am and how I'm disrespectful for not taking care of him (I'm the one that's in a wheelchair! I physically can't!!!). I've also developed a hoarding issue since he moved out (I've kept in contained to my bedroom thankfully) so I've been sleeping in the guest room but he's going to get pissed at me and throw everything away which just makes me want to hoard more.   My mom waited to tell me until I was on the way to see my therapist (literally an hour and a half ago) so my therapist was trying to help me process and think of what to do but all she could think of was getting the police involved or having an actual conversation with him about how much he's killing me and I just can't do that and I'm pretty much disassociated so I can't think. Im just so overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.   If my mom leaves him I lose my military insurance, which means I can't see any of my specialists and we can't afford my medications and treatments on my moms salary . My sister also would loose her college tuition and all she's ever wanted was to be a doctor so it's not fair for me to take the away from her.   I just don't know what to do, I feel like my life is collapsing around me and I can't breathe. I just really want to die but I know then my dad would blame my mom and probably kill her I don't know.   My mom keeps asking me to tell her what to do and I just don't know! I'm a child for fucks sake, I should be worried about homecoming not how long could I survive without health insurance or if my dad will kill my mom.   I love him and I want everything to be ok and I don't know what to do. 
Reagan_here	I think mindfulness is an important aspect of a well rounded treatment plan, it has to be used in conjunction with other things in order to really be effective. I honestly think everyone with a chronic health condition should see a therapist, not because it will necessarily help the condition, but because depression is a common side effect of constant pain.   Although fuck doctors that just say to see a therapist and assume everyone has conversion disorder. 
Reagan_here	What was your experience with Mayo like? I know some people who did the peds rehab program and they just seemed really *weird* about things. Like if you fainted from POTS you had to wear a helmet for two days and got your phone taken away. It was all very weird and sorta seemed like it treated POTS like a conversion disorder. 
Reagan_here	Flushing is honestly the worst! I get really bad facial flushing (probably mcas, but who knows) and it feels like my face is just melting off. It's the worst sensation
Reagan_here	Let's talk pain management | So recently I did a big no-no and stopped all my medication cold turkey. I know it was a bad decision and I really let my impulsive teenage qualities show through. I had done it because the side effects just weren't worth it and I've been steadily getting worse on them, not to alarm anyone, but the pain is generally so constant and horrible that suicide has crossed my mind. Instead of being a whiny teen girl, I figured what I need to do is figure out what I can actually do for pain management.  Here's what I'm currently doing:  * 15mg mobic (brings pain from a 7 to a 6.75, gave me an ulcer)  * 300mg Effexor   * Topical pain ointments (helps with muscle aches, doesn't touch joint pain)  * Meditation/deep breathing  * CBT  What I'm starting/considering moving forward:  * PT starts in a week! I'm hoping it's a game changer but I know it's a long process  * Stop the mobic completely, it's not worth the stomach issues. I've tried ever NSAID in the book and they just don't work for me.  * I'm getting a Cefaly in two weeks to help with my migraines * Nerve block in my neck  * I took tramadol once and it was crazy helpful, but I'm worried about addiction and all that nasty stuff. Last year my cousin ODed on heroin and it's just made opioids a hard no, not to mention at 17, I have to consider what effect this could have on my neurological development.   * Medical Cannabis? I'm way too worried about looking like a stoner to ask my doctors about this as an option. I've only ever smoked twice, and I ended up with bronchitis a few weeks later. Also the same problems with neurological development put me off.  * I'm starting a biofeedback study in 5 weeks, it's more aimed at anxiety, but I'm imagining it will help  I honestly just don't know how to have a conversation about pain with my doctors. I feel like I'm catastrophizing if I say how bad it really is but then I just end up down playing it. I also don't "look" like I'm in as much pain because it's just so constant I've adjusted to it. I can often be found just silently crying while I carry on doing a task, I just try to live a normal life. For example, I dislocated my kneecap in the middle of class a few months ago, I didn't make a big deal out of it, hell, I didn't even have the nurse come put it back in place for me. I just popped the sucker back in and cried for a bit.   Anyone have any advice or suggestions? I can't keep living like this. 
Reagan_here	No worries, I'm honestly just really weird with medications I think, I've never had any withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose/stopping effexor. It's been a week since I last took it and the only difference is I'm super depressed. I'm starting it again tomorrow though, it's definitely necessary to stabilize my mood. Thanks for the concern though, bodies are weird sometimes. 
Reagan_here	John Green is your new god. Listen to crash course all the time. Memorize it. Breathe it. Become it. 
Reagan_here	Should I not bother with a microbio degree? | I'm in my freshman year of college and for the past several years I've had my heart set on getting a bachelors in microbiology. I just honestly love it, I've never had a passion in the same way. Although now that I've been trying to figure out my post-college plans I've realized that it's not the most employable degree. I know a lot of people suggest doing a comp sci minor and going into that side of science, but I just don't love it like I love good ol' lab work. You need me to streak 50 plates? Hell yea' I'm loving it.   I live in a good area for jobs (DC) but I'm still worried that I'll be completely unemployable. Do I need to grow up and realize that it's a stupid degree choice?  
Reagan_here	My community college actually offers that program! And we have a 96% pass rate! I'm definitely going to meet with my advisor and see about getting started 
Reagan_here	My only exposure is really a dad with a PhD in it. I also took "design tech" freshman year of high school and coded an html website about my cats. 
Reagan_here	Thank you! I'm so relieved to hear that! 
Reagan_here	Thank you! 
Reagan_here	Would there be any benefit if I just did a double major in math and microbiology? I'm just not cut out for compsci
Reagan_here	Thank you so much for all the amazing information! It's definitely helping me. It's crazy that I didn't know about this before, it's just been drilled into my head that the only real options for a science degree was research, that's definitely not the case.   As for questions, what's the worst part about being a lab technologist?  
Reagan_here	There's a difference between "this is disturbing and gross" and "this has triggered self harming urges that are extremely overwhelming". They aren't there to tell people what's spooky, it's to keep people safe. 
Reagan_here	Can we please get a trigger warning on this? I don't mean to be that person but I definitely should not have read that. 
Reagan_here	Wow! How on earth do you manage hEDS and being a doctor?! I was originally looking into a career in medicine but my doctors convinced me that it was not possible with how sick I am. In a cruel twist of fate I actually see my doctors at my dream medical school. Luckily I've found that I'm way more passionate for lab work, so I'm happy. 
Reagan_here	I'm aware it's unhealthy, I'm just used to nosleep having trigger warnings on posts like this, so it caught me off guard. I just wanted to say something so it could be added to the post in hopes of helping someone who might not react well to the subject matter. For some reason people struggling with mental health issues are really drawn to the horror genre and I think we can all agree that having a tag on a post isn't hurting anything.   But if you were actually worried about my well being, I'm fine. I'm 2 years clean, it takes a little more to throw me. 
Reagan_here	There's really nothing I can say other than I am so sorry. Losing a pet can be extremely traumatic, but you have time to say goodbye and make the rest of his/her life as comfortable as possible. Something you might want to consider is reaching out to your friends and letting them know you're going through a tough time right now. It's ok for you to grieve and it's important to have people around to support you. Lastly, I just want you to know this isn't your fault, blaming yourself will just hurt you in the long run. Can you give your cat a nice snuggle for me? 
Reagan_here	I'm definitely starting with research asap. I'm at community college right now, but my transfer school is always looking for undergrads to help in research so I should hopefully start once I transfer. I'm on a five year plan so I'll hopefully graduate with 3 years lab experience. 
Reagan_here	You can go to the sidebar and uncheck the box that says "show trigger warnings". Boom, now it doesn't affect you and people can stay safe. 
Reagan_here	I was thinking of taking a few of my colleges medical lab technician classes, do you think that would be beneficial? If I complete the whole program I can take the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Board of Certification exam. I could do this at the same time as my bachelors.   Do you think having the certification would be a benefit if I want to go into a microbiology career? 
Reagan_here	Eh maybe it's just me, but I have a 6 month old bright purple acne scar on my chin, along with several other lesser scars on my pale-as-paper face. I think it more so depends on how you scar vs what your skin tone is 
Reagan_here	Girls don't get emotional on their period, it's before. It's Pre Menstrual Symptoms. Pre as in before. 
Reagan_here	Well yes, but they're emotional in the same way a man would be emotional if they felt like they really had to shit for a week straight, not hormones emotional.  
Reagan_here	I'm 17 and I need a cane and it fucking sucks. I'm just so tired of not being able to walk or do normal teenage things. My best friend is applying to universities and I'm scheduling doctors appointments. I had to drop out of high school and all I want is to be in stupid classes and fall in love with stupid girls and talk about stupid drama. But no, I have to worry about surgeries and medication interactions and doctors. My other best friend is at college and having sex and living the life, meanwhile I'd probably end up with a dislocated hip and worsen my prolapse if I even thought about sleeping with someone. It sucks being young and sick. John Green made me think this shit was awesome. 
Reagan_here	You're a freaking superhero! You have a human inside of you! How awesome is that?!? I can't even imagine how difficult pregnancy with EDS must be, but look at you go! I don't have any advice or anything, I just think you're awesome. I hope you have a boring rest of your pregnancy!
Reagan_here	Have you tried a Celafy for migraines? It seems absurd that electrocuting your forehead helps, but it is the most magical thing ever. I went from crying in pain to no migraine in 20 minutes. My neurologist had one at his office that he let my try before I took the plunge and bought my own. 
Reagan_here	👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I am so sick of the logic "omg they're hypermobile obviously it's EDS!!!" It hurts people who legitimately have EDS because it makes it seem like no big deal. 
Reagan_here	I don't have any advice, I just want to say that a lot of people are in the same situation as you (me included) and it fucking sucks. Did you talk to your doctor about how you were concerned about the side effects? Honestly, I've been on an SNRI for the past year and the sexual side effects suck, not to be tmi, but god I'm 17, I should be able to have sexual pleasure. I'm in the prime of my life for fucks sake.   Anyways, sorry for my own rant, I really hope you get some solid pain management on board. Have you tried hydrotherapy? Just floating helps to take the pressure off your joints. 
Reagan_here	If I give it the option to, my body will sleep for 13+ hours | Is anyone else having this issue? It started after high school ended in June, but it's been more and more obvious the last few weeks (aka when I started leaving my house). I'm tired by the end of the day, but not what I would consider tired enough to sleep for over half a day.   Previously I was only needing 9 hours a night to be fairly functional the next day, but now I'm exhausted if I get any less than 12. I've been having a migraine flare, so that could be contributing, but this is sorta ridiculous. I'm also not sure how restful this sleep is, I've been having spine issues so I'm imagining it's possible I'm waking up every 30 minutes from pain.   Does anyone else need excessive amounts of sleep? Would this warrant a visit to the PCP? I'm seeing my neurologist again in 2 months, should I just bring it up then? 
Reagan_here	Check out glassesusa.com, if you watch for a deal you can get prescription sunglasses for ~$50
Reagan_here	Wow, I just looked at the symptoms for narcolepsy and it fits me to a tee, I assumed everyone experienced episodes where they randomly just get really weak! I'm honestly not sure if it makes sense to pursue a diagnosis though, I'm already taking a stimulant and an SNRI (that's looking like the main treatment for narcolepsy). 
Reagan_here	Oh yeah no, I'm on .2mg of florinef and take 2g of salt tablets a day (along with an uncomfortable amount on all my food), not to mention perpetually chugging water. I'm sorta at the "last line of defense" 
Reagan_here	Yeah, I think I'll check in with her, I'm supposed to see her to update on how my ulcer is going so I'll kill two birds with one stone.  I don't want to seem like I'm disregarding his opinion, I think he's a great doctor, I just think maybe I explained how I was functioning wrong. Like, I told him that I needed to start using a wheelchair but didn't clarify that it was because my knee instability, not my pots. So to him it looked like I was worse because of deconditioning, ergo I just needed to walk more, when in reality it's just a fact of life. 
Reagan_here	Do you take "holidays"? I'm on vyvanse 20mg and I take a drug holiday (basically just don't take it) every weekend in order to prevent tolerance. 
Reagan_here	That is true, I think I've managed to forget that, you know, I'm sick and sick bodies do things differently.
Reagan_here	Yep, I have severe POTS, my resting heart rate doesn't go below 110. But my cardiologist says I'm not sick enough to get saline infusions so...
Reagan_here	Have you seen an orthopedic surgeon? Sometimes the only option is to physically tighten the ligament. 
Reagan_here	I've dislocated my left knee cap 5 times now, while it's not as serious as a knee dislocations, holy fuck it hurts. It hurt just as much the 5th time as the first too. I actually need to walk with a cane now because the ligaments are completely fucked, sorta like walking with a perpetually torn ACL (expect not as painful, just the instability). 
Reagan_here	Tbh with a name like queef burger, I have no clue why you wouldn't have all the friends. 
Reagan_here	Bet, are you ready to deal with spamming cat pictures?
Reagan_here	I adopted a cat in december and she's the most amazing person I've ever met. It's not necessarily a moment in time, but she's given me the greatest happiness in my life.   Would you rather lick a lizard or kiss a king crab?
Reagan_here	Nah dude I fucking love it
Reagan_here	Yeah I imagine I am, if only I had friends I could ask lol
Reagan_here	Why did you last cry?
Reagan_here	How to make friends? | So long story short I'm super sick^(TM), I don't have any friends and I honestly have no clue how to completely start over a friend group. I recently had to drop out of high school (for my senior year) and I enrolled in my local community college. I'm taking night classes so I'm fairly sure that it's going to be a majority of older people around me (aka I can't befriend them).   I'm going to join the robotics team but I don't know what to do besides that. It's also hard because I can't really go to parties (drinking alcohol would literally kill me and I have shit impulse control). I've also been alone so long that I don't know how to interact with people in a normal way, I'm assuming it's frowned upon to just randomly tell people about how you're dying but that's pretty much the only aspect of my personality at this point.   I don't want people to feel bad for me, I want people who I can talk to and make jokes with, but as soon as the "little crippled girl" starts talking people just want to spew shit about how "brave" I am, bitch I'm just getting some lunch. In order to make people more comfortable with my mobility aids I try to make self deprecating jokes but I'm thinking they just come across as too strong.   How do people start from scratch with a social life? How can I try to make the best of my senior/freshman year? How do I make myself seem like I've actually had conversations that aren't about my health? What do people take about?
Reagan_here	I think it's one of those situations where there's just no good outcome. I think that my local shelter actually took the animals who were already in the shelter pre-harvey in order to make room for displaced animals. You have to think though, if no one is moving animals out of the shelters, there's no where to put other ones. They need somewhere for displaced pets, they can't survive otherwise. It's really sad that some people may lose pets but at least they aren't dead.
Reagan_here	I want to let you know that shelters from all over the country drove down to Texas to rescue animals from flooding shelters. I'm sure an innumerable amount of animals lost their lives, but it wasn't a completely lost cause. My local shelter (all the way from Waldorf Maryland!) drove down and rescued over a hundred animals and people are swarming to adopt them. In fact, I'm going by tomorrow to pick up a baby pup!   [Here's the video from the local news station](http://wtop.com/charles-county/2017/08/md_animal_shelter_welcomes_dogs_cats_rescued_from_texas/slide/1/)
Reagan_here	I'm so sorry for your loss, just know that you did the right thing. 
Reagan_here	I hate sneezing for exactly this reason!   Edit to say that it helps if I brace with a pillow against my chest
Reagan_here	I want to say that those are all symptoms of Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder, personally I wouldn't spend time chasing an EDS diagnosis as you don't have anything that couldn't be explained by HSD. Instead I'd suggest focusing on treatment (PT, PT, and more PT). Also feel free to stay around on the subreddit, we have a few other people with HSD instead of EDS. 
Reagan_here	[Check out this recent thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/6whar6/mature_question/?st=J72M6DS4&sh=ae7c6839) 
Reagan_here	Our "mascot" is a zebra. The common medical saying is "when you hear hoofbeats, think horses" but we're the zebras
Reagan_here	Something you also might want to consider is eating high sodium foods beforehand, it keeps you blood pressure up so you don't get as tired or light headed
Reagan_here	My favorite! My pet peeve is those youtube videos of people burning F451, how could someone be so ignorant? 
Reagan_here	I'm going to community college for a bit, just to figure things out. My high school has a weird program thing where I can finish my required credits at college and they'll give me a high school diploma, so I'm doing that. I'm too sick to spend 7 hours a day at school, instead we're doing 3 hours twice a week + an online class. It was a bit of a mess though because I missed all the paper work deadlines (I was hoping I'd be well enough to go to high school but...) and classes start on Tuesday. Eventually my mom and I gave them the ultimatum of they either get the paperwork done or I was dropping out and lawyering up (the school had some not so legal discrimination issues and we agreed to not mention it if they took care of my school for senior year).   Overall, super stressful but I'm so excited it's over and I'm extra excited to go to college! I feel like an adult now! 
Reagan_here	Medically approved bulimia is really what this is. It's not fixing the root issue.
Reagan_here	It's really reassuring to hear that! I plan on going to U of MD (go terps!) after community college and it's always weird how many people say that state schools/community colleges suck. Go ahead and pay x5 as much for the same degree!   I'm awaiting genetic testing, but most likely the new clEDS variant. It's a TNXB mutation and pretty much the worst of cEDS and hEDS. My skin sucks but so do my joints, pretty much. 
Reagan_here	I can't stand the "spoonie" community for just that reason. I swear they just want to be sick. Plus it's been really frustrating because they all act like they have hEDS just because they're hypermobile. I know one girl who had a geneticist (who was an EDS specialist) say she didn't have it, yet she just says the doctor is wrong. She does gymnastics yet claims that walking dislocated her hip, it's ridiculous and is really harmful for people who actually have EDS.   Although, a bmi of 15 is really low, I know that typically anorexia patients are tubed at 14. Has anyone on your team ever brought it up? 
Reagan_here	No problem! We all have days like that! I hope your SSDI gets approved, I just got over a major paperwork hassle (officially unenrolling for high school and registering for college) and I've been completely high strung for the past month, so much so that I failed my math placement test 😐. I totally wish you the best!
Reagan_here	I'm glad that your coping well! I've found that cutting out processed foods, citrus, and most meat has really helped my stomach issues.  It's amazing how much diet really can help with GI issues, so many people go running to the doctor when they feel a tiny bit nauseous and it's like "no shit becky you eat McDonald's twice a day". My dad even wanted to take my acid reflux medication because he had heartburn from over eating, it takes weeks to start working! You can't just take one!   Sorry about the vEDS, it must be even more difficult to see all these people acting like they have EDS (and it's going to kill them) when you actually could die from it. 
Reagan_here	Are you guys looking for volunteers? Maybe someone to just come and play with the dogs? I'm the the DC area and really want to pet some dogs and do some good. 
Reagan_here	I honestly was sure this was /r/proed 
Reagan_here	Im sorry 💕 I'm in a similar position, my brother just moved back in and all he eats is fast food (he went to McDonald's twice yesterday, for example) yet his BMI is 16. It's ridiculous. He always asks me if I want any fast food and has completely filled the cupboards with binge food. My mom even bought him frozen pancakes (my literal kryptonite). 
Reagan_here	I stayed at the Willka Rumi in Urubama, but I think they might only host larger groups. If you can find time to stop in Urubama I definitely would. 
Reagan_here	I'm moderately jealous, my doctor gave me some ibuprofen and just popped that sucker back in. Granted I have dislocations a few times a month so GA each time isn't feasible. (Connective tissue disorder, my ligaments are really weak and don't keep things in place) 
Reagan_here	Honestly this really reminded me how much I'm not taking care of my body. I have a few chronic illnesses and lately I've just stopped taking my medication, it's been two weeks and i know I'm damaging my body by not taking them. I need to get back on track 
Reagan_here	Every doctor (minus my neurologist) absolutely hates that I know more about my condition than they do. I get it, I have a rare-ish illness (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome), but if they don't want to educate themselves I have to correct them. They much prefer when I act like I don't know anything about my body and their word is law. 
Reagan_here	I always get anxious ordering fast food and a diet coke, I just want to tell the cashier "I fasted all day to have these large fries and regular coke is too sweet, please don't judge me" Granted I'm also not 350lbs so I'm pretty sure no one cares.
Reagan_here	They put you under GA for a dislocated shoulder? Did they have to do surgery or just putting the joint back together? 
Reagan_here	I think the biggest difference between emotional abuse and just plan yelling is how the child's emotions are taken care of. In an emotionally abusive situation the child would get in even more trouble for getting upset. This typically leads to children bottling up emotions and/or disassociating because the brain knows that emotions=bad so it tries to stop any emotional response. Meanwhile in a normal household a parent would typically apologize or deescalate the situation, generally just make sure that the child knows that they are still loved.   For example, a kid doesn't clean the cat's litter box. A normal parent might get upset and take away a privilege. In an abusive home, the child would get called a worthless piece of trash and if they started crying the adult would then go on to threaten to kill their cat in front of them (that was a fun night growing up).  I'm not saying Virgie isn't exaggerating, she probably is, just that emotional abuse is more than just a parent yelling.
Reagan_here	I don't know if it's this pots flare messing with my brain or what but I just spent 5 minutes laughing at that first picture. Is that even logistically possible? 
Reagan_here	Do you have anything specific you could mention? I have widespread joint pain due to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, also I'm on effexor so I can't take cymbalta/lyrica. 
Reagan_here	I definitely think that psychiatric medications are over prescribed and I think it's because of the overarching American Dream of "I want it and I want it NOW". While before medication used to only be used in severe cases that didn't respond to therapy and other life style modifications (aka getting off your ass). Now, people go to see their PCP because they've been feeling upset because they got broken up with and leave with a script for Prozac, Zyprexa, and a sprinkle of Valium, most of the time they don't even start therapy.   It's a deep seated issue within our culture, it's the same reason we're facing antibiotic resistance and surgery to cut your stomach in half. The problem isn't with the medication, it's with the people who don't want to work to get better. 
Reagan_here	¡Hola! Does anyone have some favorite recipes they could share with me? | I spent two weeks in Peru a few years ago and today while going through my pictures from the trip I was hit with the "travel bug" and desperately want to go back. Since that's not an option for me right now, I was wondering if anyone would share some of their favorite local recipes, a majority of the ones I've found online have been very "americanized" and I would like to have food like I did in Peru. My favorite foods were quinoa, chicken, and all the potatoes!  (Lo siento para la mala traducción, soy horrible al hablar español) Yo fui a perú hace 3 años y quiero ir otra vez pero yo estoy demasiado enfermo. En cambio, quiero cocinar la comida de perú. Las recetas en línea es muy "Americano" y me gustaría las recetas local. ¿Puedes compartir sus recetas favoritas? Me gusta realmente la quinoa, el pollo, y las papas. 
Reagan_here	Although I do really do appreciate being told that killing myself is a "do" thing versus a "try" thing. I just have not been putting the effort into it, I need to FORCE myself through the burning of my esophagus until the bleach really does some good damage. I need to see the silverlining, the world will be so much of a better place when I am dead. Thank you for giving me the perfect motivation, I think I'll now be able to pull myself up the the bootstraps and stop being such a fucking pussy and kill myself. 
Ruinedmylifeinamonth	How did I ruin my life so fast? | How do I even begin. I'm about to just let my life go, because I've already fucked it beyond seemingly repair.  I'm 27, gay white male living in Texas. I just totally fucked up my life.   I just found out I am HIV positive and another std.  I started sleeping around exactly one month ago, mostly unprotected. 14 people I should contact. Most of them were not "high risk" contacts but this particular strain of chlamydia is resistant.    During that month I did meth for the first time, and have gotten addicted in less than two weeks. I am shocked at everything about this drug. It is the closest thing to Satan on earth.   I cannot believe that, just a month ago, I was successful and had a decently good life. After beating homelessness for 6 months, and keeping my shit together then, I am so angry at myself for not being in control now. I wonder why all the recklessness and what triggered that.   I guess I have always wanted to kill myself (I say it to myself nearly every day) but I never had thought it would be because or this. I am doing research and will have to pass along all my findings to someone else, I have done nothing else with my life, barely have done anything else other than good grades 3.92 mcl and PBK, and I am so ashamed of my life now.   I cannot go on. I have access to nitrogen lines, and have tracked my O2 sats, and you are out in 15 seconds. I just don't want my lab partners to find my body.  
Ruinedmylifeinamonth	Thank you for responding. I'm just numb as fuck right now. I don't even feel like I have a soul anymore.  You don't have to reply. 
Ruinedmylifeinamonth	Had any one else just totally thrown their life away? | [removed]
Ruinedmylifeinamonth	With what?
SelmaSongs	Feels like its all been building up to this |   When I was about 9 years old I had a close friend who would beg me to come over her home.  My mother, at the time, was addicted to cocaine and never present.  Our fridge and cabinets were bare, and I had already stolen (and had been caught) from the local C-town. So I agreed to go to her home for the night, hoping to get dinner.     For the next two years I was raped by her grandfather. As was she, alongside me, and her younger sister Jeanine.  He would make us do things to each other, and told me every time "you know if you tell anyone, I'll have to hurt them".  He always assured me he was old, and taking his own life would be easy. He would bring out his gun and show it to me, sometimes making me hold it. When I was 13 he passed away, and the next year Jeanine hung herself. This has been living inside of me all these years.     The past 7 years I've lived with a man who I fell head over heels for.  He was perfect, funny, smart and knew about my past.  To him, in the beginning, I wasn't flawed or tainted.  One night, during an argument, he shoved me against a wall.  I was scared, and began crying.  He held me and told me "i will never ever hit you. I'm so sorry. I will never be the man my father was."  The first punch came only a few months later. I found myself so obsessed with the fact that he loved me despite my past, that I didn't leave.  Over the next years he forbid me from seeing my friends, my family, and the beatings got worse.  But something inside of me wouldn't let me leave. What if I never found someone that accepted me again, and what if it was really just me making him act like this.  He'd tell me he never treated any other woman like this, and it was my fault for being a virus.  He wants a regular woman, someone who didn't have an "old mans dick" inside of me. That "women like me" ask to get raped.  Once I  begin to cry, it gets worse, and everything around me goes to black.  And then its just me, and the past, playing again and again...over and over...as the man I love laughs at me.   In 2013 my sister committed suicide. One of our last conversations was her crying, asking me why she wasn't enough for me to realize I had to get out of this relationship. Begging me to come live with her, and that she lived in agony knowing of my situation.  I've always blamed myself.  In 2015, during the same month my sister had passed, my best friend died of an opiate overdose, and I was the last person he texted- asking me to come visit him (he lived 12 blocks away). But I was with my boyfriend, and he wouldn't allow me to go out.  The next day he was found dead. I have never forgiven myself.    Now we both live in NYC, and all my friends and family have long abandoned me for not leaving him.  He recently told me I need to leave the house in two weeks, because he needs to have sex with other women.  I have no family, or friends to turn to. Shelters are full, and the street terrifies me.  I've been attempting suicide for as long as I can remember, before the rape. Back when my mother became abusive and chose her drug over me. I feel like it's all building up to this. I drink every day, more than anyone I've ever met.  I've never been more afraid of people, and my day to day has gotten so foggy.  Happiness is something I can't remember, I spend my days in a studio apartment, my body is covered in self harm scars that will never fade.  I hear this mans voice in my head whenever i See myself in a mirror, whenever I make a mistake. It never goes away. I am not at peace, and I feel like there is only one way out now.  The damage is within me, and eating me alive, and I just want to be free. If my sister could do it, so can I. He tells me all the time I'm being selfish by staying alive, because I couldve saved them. And I bring nothing but burden to everyone I meet. I know this is why my mother disowned me, and why my father ignored my calls.    I work in a field that involved me being around a lot of different types of medicine, and I've been researching. I think I found a good cocktail.  I haven't been as happy as I was when I found out the medicine was available to me in a long, long time.  I've made so many bad choices, and took so m any lives for granted.  What if you can start again? And even if not, even if its all a vast nothingness, it would be so much better than this life.  I hope for the courage and strength to finally do what needs to be done, and be at peace.  
keltwolf	I need help to figure out | What do I have on handf to end it? Some alcohol to numb but can't slit my wrists, pills would be good.
keltwolf	Mi uncle was there....I cant talk to  him.
keltwolf	Good bye
keltwolf	Your 3rd, or whatever paragraph, says it well. I think of you guys as my friends. At this point, only friends. We are all screwed, so lets not slam each pther.
keltwolf	OK...you are God that knows all, anD everything! And how is waiting for total babes coming over to you working out?
keltwolf	Not a trol, so a moron. This happens. So yes, delusional,.  
keltwolf	You know what this breed? The FA dude trying for a FA lady. It can work, but given the forced nature. On his part, or hers, or both. 2 Socially awkward people say yes. and go on. If they do, it falls apart. Odds are, they don't. And they all live with the woulda, coul;da 
keltwolf	Emergency and nothing | As someone in Irmas path. Central Florida. I'm here for small numbers (I have a mother with dementia, deal with it), so small. Its not much, but I'm trying. 
keltwolf	It's very easy, actually. You approach her, talk TO her, not AT her. You actually find out about her. This does require you to talk and LISTEN to her. Dude...she could be interesting! Blown mind! We are all basically FA. Some of us take it to the next level. Ask her. If she's attached, she will tell you, but you will make her day! And, hopefully her other! If she's single but not interested, again, hopefully she's tactful. No thanks I'm waiting or similar. Move on. Don't just skulk away! Wish her a nice day as you are leaving. Pump the ladies up. She will share this with her friends. So he asked you out, and just left? Shithead. No, he was nice, said have a nice day with a smile. He was nice. Idea implanted. Not all of us guys are shitheads. 
keltwolf	She was very chatty. Again, I'm guessing she was close to end of shift or break and needed the break. I go with being very nice, jus a really friendly girl. Hey, I can dream! She wanted me! Don't pop my bubble dude or dudette!!! LOL
keltwolf	Thank you. Still several hours from the Keys. Then several hours from there. Guessing tommorow I might not be able to post this. Biggest issue will be power loss. That's all. 
keltwolf	No reply
keltwolf	It says that you are an adventurous lady with an eye for style.
keltwolf	Mid ring is way too tight. | So going with the large ring. Had 1x of me backing out. Since I went to the large, much less pulling or yanking on the skin around the balls or top of cock. No pulling out. Still some pinching and grabbing. Awkward to sit down and even walk. Need to figure something out soon. Last few days locked have been great. Felt like I was about to cum from stimuli, but just not there.
keltwolf	Uhh...huh? Sorry. Didn't trigger this. 
keltwolf	Rightg away, it's a slab of flash in the your mouth. But it's so much more. It's fresh skin, and even treats (like his drooling). It's feeling his balls bounce on your tongue. And then taking him into your mouth, down. You don't have to swallow, but if you can, or you try, he will love you. Well, he won't, he'll love your throat. Use your tongue.
keltwolf	Not a joke. And for the above, a ring? yes. No ring, she's fair game. Same as a guy. If I was rocking a wedding band and a girl chatted me, thanks but no. If no ring, you are free to be chatted. 
keltwolf	I might have missed the point here. If I missed it, I'll take a stab. You'd think we would understand. We'd think you would do the same.  Its not that the same. We are all visually driven. She looks hot, he's a fucking god. I have seen ladies in yoga pants and tight tops that would rival a gym. And she's still trying to hide. Guys, not so much. They will show it. Ladies, if you keep walking around like that, my cage will be more and more painful. 
keltwolf	OK...I'm a bi guy, but that doesn't matter. Lets pick a guy...Brad, Mel, Ryan Renolds, whoever. Yes, I think they are all hot. Based on some hoestyle things, wouldn't ever get with them. Someone like giovani ribiso, his actions, yeah I'd get with him. Not attracted, but based on. So that blows the above out. She's a basket case, or a fucking mess, so I got her. How about I have that GOT IT look to her. Oh....yes, looks go both ways!! I like a fuller figure and masculine type face, but for you, you want a face tp sit on, on more .
keltwolf	She was a young cashier...so young...and the nuggets were just so young and breaded and firm. She was about 25 to my 52. A little funny that I went for them, but when I offered a decent recipe for them she was into it. I think that was it. On the bus later, I was like she wanted me, I had a dinner date, she was the one, we were getting married. I don['t even know her name. 
keltwolf	Oh, I'm 50, but not bad for 45.
keltwolf	Grocery store cashier, maybe 25/30 | I'm 50. She commented on me getting nuggets, not making fun, just like you getting nuggets. I exsplained a fancy thing, cheese, salsa, and more. She was like damn, never thought that way, sounds good. Ladies, was she being a cashier in the south? Was she kicking a new way to serve her kids? Or maybe, me? HAHA
keltwolf	Rot gut vodka here. Scrounged the last bit of change. What do you think about chatting and getting help tomorrow? Just us, couldn't hurt?
keltwolf	Please, don't let that asshat get to you. Yeah, the initial WTF, but just forget him. Yes, FA guys can act like "normal" guys, but so can the ladies. We are all human and prone to the pros and cons of said sapiens. I didn't see the convo, so just speaking in general. The truth hurts and I don't always want to hear it. Sometimes I'm more open and receptive, others times not at all. Still, if there is mostly truth in the message, you can always come back to it and take in a little at a time. Males can console other males, same with females. But for me, it is through women that I can get constructive criticism and insight into how to better myself for a woman. Unfortunately, online and texting can't convey the nuances of face to face talking, facial expressions, tonal changes, etc. It's black and white, no gray areas with text. Please, keep sharing your insights for the rest of us males that could benefit from your perspective. Thereby hopefully another female to benefit by getting a new and improved (OK, slightly improved) FA dude.
keltwolf	Yes, I know all this. I accept that I did bad things as a good person. I still see how much of a shit I was. Yeah, therapy, that I don't have money for. Or even drugs.
keltwolf	Me. My own worst enemy. I want and need to move past the history, and who I truly am.
keltwolf	Yes, I'm a coward. Will I be rejected, I don't know. Will I ever know? I don't know. Thanks to a female (I think female, :)), she is helping me. Not sure that I'm helping her. But I'm trying. Payback and all that. Point being...you never know where SHE, or HE is. Is this my she...would be nice, but age/location. I never say never. A good female friend can work wonders. Don't get attached, use her for what she is willing to share. More females seem to like this. Give them their space. And by all that is right with the world, try and pick up if SHE'S the one into you!
keltwolf	Well, can't fault you at all. You could always consider me a friend. Or at least a good acquaintance. Best of luck!
keltwolf	Or...you ask the FA lady out...to her face. Yeah, you have to do this. I want to be asked to hang out via phone or text. But a phone call? Yes, old school, but they didn't have us loosers then. She smiles at you, shows interest, ask her out. No slick anything. Hi, could we meet up for X sometime? 
keltwolf	OK...didn't get beyond 4. FA girls want the whole magilla. The god damned bitches!!!!  Now as, a FA male, not even a dude. our point is to attract a female. OK, Simple. If we attract a largere portion of that female (assuming its 1 female), then wouldn't that be score? Assuming fem FA felt the same way? I never bathe but have a good online presence. She will never meet meet me (I hope), based on that. Online helps us weed out some traits we don't like. But you should meet everyone. Can't get past the Kale, fine. Can't get past his obnoxiousness? Fine. Guys....tone it down. It's not all a game. Ask her how she is, not some gamespeak. How was her day, would she like a littl;e time. That there is a big one. Offer her time away to just veg. If she likes you, she will come back. This isn't your mom or sister. This isn't your queen in a quest!!! This is a person wanting to chat with you as a person. Drop the swords and crap. Ask her how she is. How was her day. Tell her you thought about her today you better mean it. Don't do the dream thing. Lame.
keltwolf	Hi kiddies....Daddy here. Guess what, there aint no spectrum. It's a crock. Spectrum is code for socially awkward. That's me. Bi polar and adult ADD, yeah, thats me, and there are others out there. Maybe not diagnosed, maybe "not on the spectrum". Basically, that means your parents didn't raise you right. So stop trying to have an issue when you don't. I keep trying to go without meds so as NOT to not have an issue. I fight every single fucking day to stay alive. When my mother forgets who she is, and who I am, I want to jump in front of a truck. I don't. I tried 2x, both lame. But I wanted out. I still want out. How's your fucking spectrum working now? You feel the pain of living? The ulimate loss if you kill yourself, how to explain. I want to never wake up from this pain, yet know that my freedom will cause so much pain. 
keltwolf	Speaker meeting is they have someone, or several people come in and tell their story. Non speaker meetings are more of a free for all. Anyone can talk about an issue they are dealing with, or you go around the room and share or pass. Mens and womens meetings are just that. Same as LGTB, young peoples, special focus type meetings, the focus is alcohol but also issues more related to those groups.
keltwolf	And then 2400bps came out and we thought we were hot shit! Good old BBS's! The Night Exchange, Skyline out of CT. Those were the day.
keltwolf	Well, hel-LOOOO! How YOU doing?
keltwolf	Your friend likes the cock, huh?
keltwolf	I sort of have the same situation. I had gastric bypass back in 2004 and lost as of now about 120lbs (but was 150 at my best). Problem is, it comes off so fast, the skin can't recover. Been stretched for so long, that I probably have 15-20lbs of loose skin/flab. If I could afford the plastic surgery to get it removed, I'd be much better off. Smaller tummy that Spanx could hide. But this is too much. I used to have a laced waist cincher that I loved, but got tossed in a combo purge/house gutting. Don't really have any other clothes except a couple pair of panties and some stockings, panythose, and tights. I'd guess Spanx (or similar type) to pull it in as much as it can, and looser tops with skirts/pants/shorts on lower body.
keltwolf	I'll take you at your word, but still say it was later that afternoon or next day! That bikini has served her well!
keltwolf	Exactly however the hell she tells me to!!! Only hope that includes a couple hours of face sitting though.
keltwolf	Other than the ravages of time on the material and elastic, you could keep on wearing it! But, now you don't have a bathing suit, so I'm waiting for you to post pictures of your next trip to the beach. Should look much better! I'd bet money those were taken the same day!
keltwolf	Works for me!!
keltwolf	Way out of my league!
keltwolf	Fun day out | So, spent the last 2 days and nights self locked, very sore in the morning with the mid sized ring. A bit of teasing myself during the day. Today, store hopping to grab last minute hurricane Irma needs, so decided to stay locked and added my metal plug. The cage I have is on the large size, as has been pointed out to me :) and doesn't have that sharp downward bend that other cages seem to have. This forces me to point the cage straight down, and in some shorts I think it's noticeable to those looking and in the know. I had loose cargo pants on, and I swear sometimes it felt like I was trying to lift up a bit. With the plug in my ass, the large amount of visible stimuli in the stores, there was some swelling going on, just not sustained. Getting in/out of the car with the tight squeezing of the ring and added motion to the plug was a whole lot of sensations! Added was the fact that I was not alone, and those with me are not in the need to know realm. Back home and still locked and plugged. 
keltwolf	About my only real life friend. We met back in NY through another friend. She's in Vegas and I'm not, we chat on the phone and text, and I intimated about it. Pretty certain she knows what I'm talking about as she knows I am definitely on the kinky side of things. She's not. We respect each others boundaries. Depending on who's out and about when I'm in certain shorts, whoever decides to check out my groin area will have something to think about. Oh, and of course you guys and whoever has read my recent CL ads.
keltwolf	Eternal loneliness. Although loneliness in itself isn't weird.
keltwolf	Sexy babe, check. Big boobs, check. Boots...HOT!!!!!!
keltwolf	So very pretty. If I wasn't so intimidated (and old), would love to ask you out.
keltwolf	Thank you!! Maybe I kept trying too late at night and was too tired, and the brain was asleep already. Glad I finally got it right enough for you guys. Appreciate what you mods do!
keltwolf	Would love to pick you up just as you are for our date! The first of many.
keltwolf	You are gorgeous!
keltwolf	Verification try #4, after this I'm done | 
keltwolf	HAHA
keltwolf	Well then, I'll go grab my trowel and will dig some up!!
keltwolf	All day, everyday! And a dozen times on Sundays!
keltwolf	So, so cute!!
keltwolf	Your tag says to pet often. Are there other options I can choose from???
keltwolf	Would've sat down beside you and try to strike up a conversation.
keltwolf	Would love t help her out! However she likes! She is sexy as hell
keltwolf	You make a sign with your username and todays date. Then post that with your cage visible in the same picture. Make sure you either write backwards (so it looks right in the pic), or figure something like that out. I've been having a tough time getting it all correct, so if you look on the right of the screen and scroll down, there's a list of moderators. They should be better able to assist you better.
keltwolf	Basically have one IRL friend. She lives in Vegas, I'm in FL. We will text and chat, but it's always her bitching about this or that, with me maybe getting in a few words here and there. It's draining. Other than FB friends that we share posts with, that's it. Biggest female interaction of late was the cashier at a grocery store asking about the pack of chicken nuggets I was buying. Was in the mood, they were Perdue so better quality. I told her what I planned to do with them after she made a little joke about them being kids food. She got real interested with my choices. Stupid me should've tried to pimp hand that into an invite, but didn't. 1st, felt it was just idle chatter to kill time for her, and 2nd, am probably double her age and then some. 
keltwolf	3rd times a charm?? | 
keltwolf	I think I'd like to get to know you better. A lot better. So pretty.
keltwolf	Call or text him! Just checking that you got home OK was him being a good guy. Asking about work requires a response other than yes home thanks. Works into, had a crappy work day but maybe you can brighten my evening? Or had a decent day, wanna grab coffee? It's a convo starter. Coming from an insecure, anxiety riddled male, if I were to be in his shoes and sent you the work question I'd be hoping and praying to get a response like I stated. He's interested, or was.
keltwolf	Verification redo | 
keltwolf	I was holding the sign. Can't write backwards so it reads right. 1st one the writing was backwards and not too clear I guess. I'll try and redo it.
keltwolf	Hope this one passes the test.
keltwolf	Nice!
keltwolf	You ain't lying! Def a cutie.
keltwolf	Would give her my best shot!
keltwolf	Husband and MIL are at fault. By the same token, my wife miscarried 2x. Both times I was there throughout it all. First time we didn't know and she passed the baby at home on our bed. Traumatic. I was there for her, loving, attentive, getting her whatever she asked for, cuddling when she wanted, giving her space when she didn't. She shut down and never talked to me about it. Either one. I was there too. Yes, it happened to her, but we were a couple. So fast forward, we ended up mainly room mates, me using alcohol to cope with never being able to talk about this, and now we are no longer married. So it goes both ways. You are in the right. Will you get over it? Don't know, but hope you do. Maybe counseling will help. Will your relationship survive? Depends on how much forgiveness you have, and if hubby removes his head from his ass. Best of luck!
keltwolf	Yes, but it certianly also makes it look very suckable.
keltwolf	Thank you. Sorry if I didn't make it clear. That's why I didn't add anything on patching.
keltwolf	Same here. I get a job, go hypermanic and lose it. Then comes the depression. The cycle never ends.
keltwolf	https://imgur.com/a/bQPgY So she's really getting daring and wants anyone in Sanford that sees her to stop and try and get her to blow you. She wants to, just scared about popping her cherry.
keltwolf	Justine at it again-Album in comments | 
keltwolf	You'd have to cap off the wires after removing the switch, then use electrical tape to tape the wire nuts on. You'd have to turn the breaker off to do this safely.
keltwolf	Would love for you to do her doggy style with me tongueing her from underneath!
keltwolf	Only helps with CL posting for sex only. And even then, they flake out.
keltwolf	Appropriate;y named, as you always slay me! I just got a jeweled plug and metal cage too. Wish you were closer, we could hold each others keys. Gorgeous as always!
keltwolf	Thanks!
keltwolf	WOW!!! You're gorgeous!!!
keltwolf	You just suck it up and do it. Either that or have someone post them for you.
keltwolf	Two sexy girls with me in the middle??
keltwolf	Yes, I too would love to find someone local to supply me with their meat.
keltwolf	No slip outs, but it's snug, so a little irritation. 
keltwolf	Ok, doing ad we speak 
keltwolf	Newest Sissy Justine 503-516 | 
keltwolf	With my setup as it is, I slipped out the back. Yeah, I get that small. Would a smaller ring help that? I know a smaller cage is needed. Was going to use a zip tie or 2 to snug up the gaps. Not sure how a smaller ring would work. Any explanations? | 
keltwolf	Where honey? Central FL?
keltwolf	She got an appreciative check out by a dude, but is still too shy to just ask for dick. Encourage the fucking slut to suck her first cock! Short of coming to me so I can properly deflower her. 
keltwolf	OMG!!! So sexy and hot! If only you lived closer, and were into it, having you as my keyholder would be hot.
keltwolf	CB900F was almost my 1st. Ended up being a CB1000C Honda, then a Kawi Concours that I tricked out to go bad on the street. That got wrecked parked in a lot. Then went to a Triumph Sprint 900. Stared dragging knees on that machine. Gave it up as I couldn't trust my judgement. So want to get back into riding. 
keltwolf	What bike???????? 
keltwolf	I would love it if you didn't. Just stay the same.
keltwolf	That smile and those boobs will never let you down!
keltwolf	Teasing and torturing myself | 
keltwolf	For me you more than overqualify for wifely material!!!
keltwolf	OK, so I slipped out the back end today after wearing it all night. It cam with 3 rings, I was using the largest ring. Would stepping down to the middle sized ring, or the smallest help with this? It's going to be awhile before I can get a smaller cage, so looking to make this work for now. It appears to be a design flaw allowing a little too much play between the ring and interaction with the cage that allows the extra room, and a shorter cage doesn't look like it would solve this. For a temp fix I might add a zip tie or 2 between the bottom of the cage and ring to take up any slack.
keltwolf	Hello, I'm a self locked guy. If I'm locked, you can't cum.  If maybe you got some ice, it would help me keep your thoughts in mind. Or Not. I could tease and deny you, and if you don't reply, you tease and deny me. Interesting. I'm in FL, 52mw. Right off the bat not sure of how we can do this, but give me a minute and I'm sure we could come up with som fun. 
keltwolf	[Request] 52 m4A Orlando - Looking for keyholder and Dom/Domme | New in chastity and would love to serve a keyholder (M/F/T) in whatever capacity they desire. Am bi, so open to all.
keltwolf	Ahh...I had it around the lock only. I could still hear it, but doubt anyone else would. I'll just do that, thanks!
MaybePunk	Does it also almost frustrate you guys how "normal" the symptoms of depression seem to be? | Like to an onlooker this could almost appear to be extreme laziness and shit.  But no I'm not actually "ill" i just need to get a grip of myself and stop being such a tired, moody, boring little shit.
MaybePunk	I had someone say this a few days ago. They don't seem to be able to grasp that I feel depressed littleraly all of the time.
MaybePunk	I get you, I mean do people think that going around doctors and counselling every 2 weeks is my favourite hobby or something?
MaybePunk	I get what you mean, my family is extremely dissapointed with me but I've learnt that I need to stop trying to live up to their standards. Right now I'm proud of myself for still being alive and sort of managing to look after myself.
MaybePunk	Yes, whenever anyone even starts saying "Have you tried...?" there's a 99.99% chance that I already have.
MaybePunk	My mum says the same thing "Back in my day this was just called laziness, now it's" Depression"".
MaybePunk	If we could feel better whenever we wanted we would all just choose happiness though, right?
MaybePunk	I'm sorry, it looks like it's been a long ride for you (if that phrase makes any sense, sorry I'm tired). Your post gave me quite a bit of encouragement to keep going. Best of luck btw :) I hope things turn out well for you. Keep sharing your experience and don't be ashamed of it!
MaybePunk	Yes like no shit, thank you guys, you cured me for pointing that out... Really, I never knew.
MaybePunk	Same, I littleraly just stopped caring though.
MaybePunk	Very true
MaybePunk	Same
MaybePunk	> .....If we think about flying we don't turn into an airplane.  Yes, this ^ omg
MaybePunk	They could, I mean I'd say it's always worth a try
MaybePunk	I get what you mean. But recovery isn't a straight line is it? We all have ups and downs and sometimes relapse. I'm sure she won't find you stupid or anything, that's most likely just your depression talking. And I mean she is a therapist, I'm sure she's seen people having ups, downs, being at rock bottom etc. Etc.
MaybePunk	Wow... I... I feel the same way...
MaybePunk	I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope absolutely not all Hope is lost. I mean changing medication could possibly make you feel better.
MaybePunk	I don't understand how this is supposed to help OP in any way
MaybePunk	Omg I feel your pain. Sorry I can't exactly offer any advice.
MaybePunk	I know, best of luck to you also. It honestly is a daily struggle.
MaybePunk	Yeah, it's really great to hear :D
MaybePunk	I'm so glad you are making progress! Posts like these really do give me a lot of hope.
MaybePunk	I think I get what you mean, do you want to talk about it?
MaybePunk	I could have guessed, what's COBRA?
MaybePunk	I get what you mean, I personally know that there are solutions but honestly I'm just tired of waiting.
MaybePunk	Hmmm... I was almost about to say "try medication" but the I realised that there most likely isn't any medication that would resolve your issue exactly (or maybe there is, I'm not really sure I only really know things on depression/suicidal thoughts)  I'd say try antidepressants if you feel depressed but if you don't think they will be applicable then.... Hmmm...  I'll try to possibly think of something and if I have another idea I'll pop back and let you know. In the mean time you can vent to me anytime. Best of luck random stranger on the Internet. I hope you get better!
MaybePunk	From everything I read it appears that you did the right thing. As a suicidal person I would find what you said very comforting.
MaybePunk	I personally think that you did the right thing
MaybePunk	Do you live in a country that doesn't have free health care?
MaybePunk	I definitely think you should try that :)
MaybePunk	Honestly I really don't know what went on.
MaybePunk	I've had my dose increased fairly recently and it was "working" even on the lowest dosage.
MaybePunk	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. Sorry that I can't exactly offer very much advice. Have you considered counselling/theraphy or medication?
MaybePunk	Have you considered seeing a different psychiatrist? That could possibly change things around. And thank you, I've started fluoxetine just over a month ago, I felt a bit better after about 2 weeks and had a fairly decent (almost a) month on them. Then I went back to school and it all crashed. 
MaybePunk	Depression is a liar, people really do care about you. It's hard to believe, I know, but trust me.
MaybePunk	I think that your friends would most likely be supportive.
MaybePunk	Have you tried a different medication or any other treatment?
MaybePunk	I'm probably going to be in a similar situation soon. Sadly there's nothing that can really be done about it. Have you tried any other treatments? I think there are over things out there for treatment resistant depression but I haven't really looked.  Sorry what I'm saying probably isn't very reassuring at all. I just hope you get better, feel free to message me if you want to vent anytime. Best of luck.
MaybePunk	How come? Do you have any acquaintances at all?
MaybePunk	Oh I forgot the most obvious one, I'd say. At least where I live there are many counselling places (? That's really not the right term is it, I'm tired. Apologies) which you can simply find the details online for and ring up and book an appointment.
MaybePunk	Do you go to school? College? anything like that? I'm sure places like schools could refer you somewhere unless they have a councillor on site.  Even going to your doctors office or some form of community centre could help you find someone who could help point you in the right direction.  Do you have any trusted friends who you could open up to? Or some people who you know have struggled with mental illness because I'm sure they'll be willing to give you a helping hand.  If you get very desperate you could go to accident and emergency especially if you are suicidal. I mean whatever keeps you alive, right?
MaybePunk	That may have happened to me... I started medication just over a month ago. After 2 weeks I started feeling some effects and had a fairly nice (almost a) month after that, it wasn't perfect but it was better than any other time in the past 2 years... I went back to school and it all got just as bad as before if not even worse.   Have you considered going back to your GP/ whoever prescribed you the antidepressants if you haven't already?
MaybePunk	Have you considered trying counselling or theraphy? That could possibly help.
MaybePunk	Sadly I can't really help you personally but have you considered counselling/theraphy?
MaybePunk	If you haven't already, I'd say go back to the GP/whoever prescribed you the meds and tell them what happened.
MaybePunk	What made you feel better?
MaybePunk	Shit, I'm so sorry to hear that, you seem worse off than me. Do you want to talk about it?
MaybePunk	Are there any friends who you could talk to?
MaybePunk	I get what you mean, is anything in particular making you suicidal?
MaybePunk	I promised myself that I would stay but I don't want to do this anymore | I promised myself that I would stay at least another year... Killing myself is pointless anyway and I know I want to get better and not just die in itself... I'm just so exhausted and it gets worse everyday... I'm just existing at this point and trying to sleep as much as possible.
MaybePunk	I get what you mean. I sadly can't really offer any advice but feel free to message me if you want to vent.
MaybePunk	I feel your pain
MaybePunk	Yiu can message me also
MaybePunk	Oh... Ok...
MaybePunk	I get you
MaybePunk	Ouch, my brain
MaybePunk	It's also hard for me to actually list things that I'm not scared of to some degree.
MaybePunk	I think like that but I have depression
MaybePunk	Pretty similar here with the first part, I really want to teach myself so many things but just don't know where to start.
MaybePunk	Possibly depression
MaybePunk	Small crying thing
MaybePunk	Intelligence 
MaybePunk	I always wanted to know whether cherry/apricot/stone fruit really do have seeds that contain enough cyanide to kill you. I'm just sorry that it could have cost your life.
MaybePunk	It wasn't an extremely close one but I remember visiting a Scottish island with very tall cliffs and puffins. We were in a hurry to get the boat back and we were rushing around a path that was very close to a cliff edge. At one point, where the path did a U turn, I considered simply jumping the gap, assuming that it was simply heather or bushes of some sort below but decided against it. I walk around the bend and look down... It was a very deep crevasse, if I had even attempted to jump I would have not made it and killed myself. 
MaybePunk	Left
MaybePunk	Psychology, it's the only thing I truly like.
MaybePunk	I just want to be happy with a job I love
MaybePunk	I'm basically running around in a lab coat... neat!
MaybePunk	Whether my depression is actually getting better or if this is just a slightly better episode. Also trying to figure what my fucked up emotions are doing.
MaybePunk	I hate chewing ice but I love frozen grapes
MaybePunk	Or I just roll over and wait until my alarm turns off itself
MaybePunk	Yes...?
MaybePunk	Young psychological issues
MaybePunk	I miss being suicidal | This probably sounds disgusting but somehow I miss being suicidal. I hate that feeling so much but simultaneously crave it, maybe it's because I secretly hope I don't recover and eventually kill myself.
MaybePunk	I just hope I recover, but simultaneously for some reason I hope it never gets better and I eventually kill myself.
MaybePunk	Ik it's fucked up, isn't it?
MaybePunk	Yeah I agree
MaybePunk	What do you mean?
MaybePunk	I wish I could do the same but I just can't cry, I wish I could... It would make me feel better.
MaybePunk	Well I hope both of us recover one day and don't crave this feeling anymore, if that makes any sense.
MaybePunk	Yeah haha, I try to be. I know that depression makes people irrational as hell.
MaybePunk	Yeah, nothing really makes me cry either so it's not like anything is going to be able to trigger it either.
MaybePunk	> We crave what we feel because its hard to experience something so unfamiliar.  Plus often times people come together to notice you and give support when you are at that point.  Sometimes I wish I could go back into the mental hospital just so I feel important and not have to think about life. When you feel like shit and have someone basically doing everything for you it's just nice.    I get what you mean, I don't like doing so but sometimes I feel like I can use depression as an excuse.    > And the thoughts of suicide has its own beneficial feeling.  It's like things are final and can come to an end at any moment, its like a sense of relief that you could just stop existing and not worry about anything or experience depression again.  Yeah, I have this sort of attitude of "Well fuck this thing, if it goes badly enough I can just kill myself" 
MaybePunk	Depression is so fucked
MaybePunk	Yeah, I prefer being sad to depressed
MaybePunk	Yeah I get what you mean, sometimes I'm like "Well if I fuck up badly enough I can just kill myself, that's always an option"
MaybePunk	What do you mean?
MaybePunk	Hey I might not be the best person to help but I'm transgender myself so feel free to message me
MaybePunk	Young I have psychological issues
MaybePunk	God... I feel this so much, it's sounds almost like something I would write myself... I might not be much help but feel free to message me any time.

MaybePunk	-8.25 and -10.25, hi guys!!!
MaybePunk	I get you, I have a friend a bit like you. She cries a lot but it doesn't make her feel better at all and she hates getting sympathy, I wish I could swap with her.
MaybePunk	I'd give you advice but I really don't have anything even for myself let alone other people. I just remember crying and being upset about a really personal issue and I was almost happy that I managed to get it all out.
MaybePunk	Well I just started antidepressants like 3 days ago, so I have pretty high hopes for them.  How are you doing man?
MaybePunk	My grades have been slipping for the past 2 years, I might not even do well enough to get into uni. It's making me feel so hopeless.
MaybePunk	What makes you think you're pathetic?
MaybePunk	Np man 
MaybePunk	I'm glad it helped you :)
insomnessu	I'm trapped, I can't do anything, I just wanna die. | I used to be a happy person, an excelent student, someone full of goals, dreams and energy to do things... but now I changed, I just feel desolated, frustrated, depressed. I just wanna die.  Things are really reallyyyy fucked up in the country where I live, people are killing each other for just a couple of dollars and we're about to become a dictatorship. I, literally, can't do anything to leave because I can't afford the fucking flight. I have a place to go, I have a cousin in other country who can receive me, I have the oportunity to wok there but...   I Can't Afford The Fucking Goddamnit Flight   And my cousin can't lend me the money. And it's been a year and a half, I've been trying everything to make money but it's just impossible. PTCs just wasted what I earned in bad referals. In my country we don't get surveys, I didn't get jobs as freelancer... I don't know what else to do.  I'm trapped. Here. In hell. And I can't do anything to get out. It's been too much time trying and I'm just tired now...  I'm giving up. I can't handle anymore the frustration, the fear of living in one of the most dangerous cities in the world, the anxiety, the feeling of having no hope for the future... I can't handle this anymore. I'm not just poor but in a society where I can't get out of this situation. It's everything, I don't have to keep suffering if it's pointless. It's not worth it. I'm sorry for my family but at least I won't have to deal with this shit anymore.
insomnessu	Thanks God it's not just me, redheads are gorgeous <3
insomnessu	Well, the comment was deleted but... I'll leave my reply here.  Aaawwwww you're right with that, It's just that it feels odd that everybody is showing pictures of themselves in the their campaigns and, well... But maybe if I explain my situation it could work. Actually you gave me a veeery good idea with the "post something else than yourself". I could make a video with my voice without showing my aspect, I didn't think of that before. And well, yes, I think I have to show my name, but at least I won't be recognized by strangers. 
eacrataes	Life is going really well for me. | Hi everyone. I'm a 32 year old male. I think I've been battling with depression since I was a teenager, but have never had problems with every day life. Any suicidal thoughts are expelled quickly and have never ever considered that to be an option for any of my problems. I have never seen a therapist to know if I truly have had, or still suffer from depression, but I've always gone to work, done my thing, smiled and on the outside am generally happy. I've had the occasional loss of a girlfriend, pet, or person I've known that makes me unhappy for awhile. For instance, when my fiance left me, I would cry uncontrollably over the dumbest shit and would always make me think about her. It took me years to get over that and start positive thinking again.  Lately, like within the last several months, I've been happier than I ever have been. Legitimately happy about life, my relationship, where my life is headed, and all has a positive outlook. Just the other day, while at work doing normal work stuff, I literally had a moment of clarity and realization about how happy I truly am. A real moment of happiness I've never felt before. I'm over the moon to have had that experience after feeling down for so many years!  But today, as I was leaving to go spend a couple days with my girlfriend, I had another moment of clarity about how well things are going, followed by an overwhelming sense of dread that it's all going to end. I've been sitting here crying for twenty minutes and can't help but think about how I'm going to fuck it all up. Consciously I know that these thoughts are completely unfounded; there's been absolutely nothing to lead me to believe that my life will implode. My question is: Is this normal to have these thoughts? Does everyone think that way sometimes, or is that some form of depression clawing at my brain? To me, it doesn't feel right to have those thoughts; which is why I'm posting. I'd like to hear others' opinions on it. Maybe recommend some books to read about fear of failure? 
eacrataes	My buddies and I will always ask "hippie or trailer park women?" To new guys to the group to get a judge of character.

eacrataes	Because of this whole damn debacle, if we start to get auto kicked every time we team kill, im doomed. I only play with irl friends and i suck pretty bad; so i probably have more team kills (knockouts included) than i do total kills in squad mode.   But hey, it's their own damn faults for scaring the shit out of me.

eacrataes	Age gap of 8 years and IQ gap of 32 points. Deep conversations are non-existent. We have separate friends and separate lives. I have to spend a lot of time to myself in order to not become extremely frustrated. I've become a bit of a condescending asshole when it comes to her naïveté.   Sex is great, although I'm seriously considering ending the relationship soon. It's always been a finite thing in my mind anyway. 
eacrataes	St. Louis city also charges a 1% earnings tax on everything you earn.   It applies to businesses who do work in the city too, even if you're out of the county/state. You get a permit to do work in the city? You're paying that tax.   Edit: also forgot to add, they're serious about it. My boss had a warrant for his arrest because he had an employee do few hours of work in the city and ignored the $.92 (yes, 92 cents) earnings tax. They finally withdrew the warrant after two years this week.

eacrataes	Can confirm. Started a new career path at 30, now 32 and heading in to my junior year. Look like an ODB.

eacrataes	/r/totallynotrobots 
eacrataes	Not just requiring ID to vote, because I absolutely agree with you that ID needs to be present at a polling location in order to vote; but there's so many more ways voter suppression happens than just ID requirements.   1. Changing polling locations. An election official can make this call just days before an election.  2. Changing polling hours or eliminating early voting days. This may be particularly problematic in urban counties where long polling lines are most likely, as Henry Grabar reported last fall.  3. Reducing the number of polling places. This raises the same problem as above, particularly when the eliminated polling places had disproportionately served minority communities.  4. At-large elections. At-large elections for school-board members or city councils often dilute the voting power of minorities who have greater influence in single-candidate district elections. In an at-large election, a cohesive voting block with 51 percent of the vote can elect 100 percent of the officials.  5. Packing majority-minority districts. Election maps drawn to push all of a community's minorities in one or a handful of districts can dilute their voting power.  6. Dividing minority districts. Similarly, election maps can slice minority communities into multiple districts so that they have no cumulative influence in any one place. The line between these two tactics is a fine one (and also illustrates why the VRA was useful for assessing facts on the ground).  7. Voter ID laws: This increasingly popular tactic, sometimes likened to a modern-day poll tax, has the potential to disenfranchise voters who don't have a driver's license, or who don't have the money or ability to obtain one (a disproportionate share of these people are minorities). Such laws can also have a disproportionate impact in cities, where many people don't own cars.  8. Onerous candidate qualifications. In 2007, a Texas provision tried to limit those people eligible to become water district supervisors to landowners who were registered to vote.  9. Changing multi-lingual voter assistance. Making it harder for non-English language speakers to vote is a good way to dilute their power.  10. Changing election dates. Another trick that may not require legislative approval.  11. Creating new elections. In 2006, the DOJ objected to a plan in the Houston area that would have eliminated some joint elections and required voters to travel to multiple polling places.  12. Canceling elections. We're not even really sure how Kilmichael, Mississippi, thought they could get away with this.
eacrataes	All jokes aside, he has started a voter fraud commission. They're supposedly tackling fraud like this documentary shows, but are ignoring the larger, and much more widespread problem of voter suppression. 
eacrataes	In his opening statement, he said he absolutely did not meet with any russian officials at the mayflower hotel AT ALL. Then, he follows up with "I do not recall."  Which is it, AG?
eacrataes	I think the centrist and leftists as a whole are working on that one. 
eacrataes	[That's a penis!](http://imgur.com/gallery/tTc9cKQ)
eacrataes	I call bs. Not a single "angry boyfriend" response and I see 3/7 profile pictures with a male. 
eacrataes	Not necessarily. People vary so much on this, even on an individual level. And in no way are we taught to see color or shape first, were taught to view the gestalt, then get more specific from there. 
eacrataes	Yeah, I really liked the Legacy of the Force comic with Cade Skywalker. I was surprised that and canon were used in the same sentence.
eacrataes	These are all current canon and not legacy?
eacrataes	You see, back in '99 we had this thing called AOL Instant Messenger.
eacrataes	Sometimes, yes. But mostly, there were big open chatrooms you could join. "A/S/L" was a big thing used.
eacrataes	It was a big chatroom and you could join other chat rooms and whatnot. Always meeting new people on it. 
eacrataes	Owned horses all my life. I'm 32. This is fairly normal behavior for a horse when they reach a small body of water. Most are reluctant to approach (streams can be rocky and hurt the feet.)   Rider was obviously new and just looked like they lost their balance. Holding on to the reigns is fairly normal on falling off, too. There's not much else to hold on to.   Overall, it's fairly typical fall. When I was a kid, that happened to me a time or two I'm sure. 
eacrataes	It looks like a Fresian. They're big horses, but usually not used for any draft activities. Clydes are much larger. 
eacrataes	Looks like a Fresian. You see them in movies quite a bit. It's definitely not a clydesdale. 
eacrataes	This is normal behavior for a horse crossing a small stream like this. They know sometimes sharp rocks can be under water, so they avoid if they can.   Source: family of horse owners. Owned them all my life. I'm 32.

eacrataes	Hydra in human, ultra in wolf. Abilities would fit this way, too.
eacrataes	Hydralisk(Human) to Ultralisk(Wolf)
eacrataes	I'd love to see a genre-bend for some of these skins. It would be very cool for greymane to have a Hydralisk skin and in worgen form, turns in to an Ultralisk.  .  Hydralisk:  Gilnean Cocktail > Acid Spit  Inner beast > ias upgrade from campaign  Darkflight > tunnels and teleports to enemy, changing to Ultralisk  Cursed bullet > lots of acid? lol  .  Ultralisk:  Razorswipe > Cleave  Inner beast > glowing blades  Disengage > burrows back in to a Hydralisk  Go for the throat > charge animation and massive damage
eacrataes	While I agree with the science behind this, I can now feel empathy for people involved in coal. My family has been small time beef and dairy cattle farmers for generations now. We even own a couple small Purina feed stores. I am afraid of the stigma of my family's chosen professions and for the future of our business model. If people are looked down on for owning cattle, pigs, chickens, or any other meat producing animal, we will lose a ton of business because the people we serve are small-time guys with usually less than 50 head.   I really like that we're advocating things on an individual level to combat climate change because our government doesn't seem to recognize the "elephant in the atmosphere," so to speak, but I would ask caution in the way that we go about this problem. Condemning and ridiculing people for eating meat (which could be an evolution of the topic of this thread) could cripple small time farmers and the people who serve them.   I attend the most liberal school, in the most liberal city in my state, in the most liberal building (fine arts) and get plenty of shit for eating meat already. So, perhaps I am overreacting based on what I've been exposed to the last couple years. I hope to have a civil discussion on my dissenting opinion if anyone replies.   Have a great evening!
eacrataes	It's left leaning news, not fake. Take the trolling back to t_d. 
eacrataes	I dislike trump as much as the next guy but even the CNN article says the subpoenas were issued "within recent weeks." And the subpoenas are for Flynn's case, not any other.   Now, this could mean that Trump has been looking to fire Comey ever since they went out. It's pretty shitty that this is just now being reported on, but the media is getting a huge spike in ratings because of the headline.   This is still going to lead to bad for Trump's administration and good things for the American people, but god damnit can we stop telling half truths in the clickbait-esque headlines?

So I blew up their social media and slammed them with shitty reviews. They finally called me and said they'd take it back... almost. They took back the stone and left me with the wedding set. I promptly went to a pawn shop expecting to get $800 or so for it, nope, offered $120. I waited for years before I found someone that wanted to trade something for the set without a stone.   I'm now the proud owner of a 1975 Honda CB500t hard tail.   Also fuck diamonds. Fuck marriage. Fuck ShaneCo.

eacrataes	> tell people "PC's better"   You said it again, man. You sure you don't have white hair and a yellow, muscular figure?
eacrataes	I think I've proved my point already. You're arguing from a standpoint that your device is superior simply because you can play from the toilet.
eacrataes	The point of a PC isn't to be a tiny, handheld device. And as far as emulators go, this BOTW build is better than most PSX2 emulated ROMs have run for me in the past. Zero crashes. Zero lag. What more do you want?  What delay do you speak of? Input lag? There's zero input lag between my controller and the Cemu.  And hey, you're the one who said PCMR. 
eacrataes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvgr1-NQg8  Here's how. Doesn't take a godlike pc to do it, either. Plenty of other videos with a stable BOTW on the 1.7.4 Cemu release.

eacrataes	Question about plagiarism in an academic setting. | I'm in a graphic design program currently and a peer in my classroom is tracing images of anime characters and passing them off as his own. We're in a bit of an argument about it and he seems to think since he traced it himself, he's not plagiarizing anything. His portfolio is literally full of these images.   Is it okay to do that in an academic setting? I know it's absolutely illegal to try and sell said images, but this is more of a grey area for my limited, non-lawyer, mind.
eacrataes	It's literally from a video game cover. Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. Appreciate the feedback. I don't want to snitch on him, because honestly, it doesn't affect me. I just want him to stop for his own sake before a professor catches on and he gets expelled.

eacrataes	I'm still in school. So there's that. I currently work at a sign shop part time. Agencies don't want anything to do with me right now. 
eacrataes	Work doesn't provide any portfolio quality work. I motivate my own ass every damn day because I want a better job. 
eacrataes	Does this website change?
eacrataes	His head.
eacrataes	> The bike by safety standards is crap. Visually the bike isn't that appealing. If you like it then ride it. >   Pot, meet kettle?  Motorcycles by definition are crap for safety. If we were that fucking worried about it, then we'd never ride. Also, stop hating on people's bikes. Half of your comments are purist bullshit. 
wxcazee	I don't often shower. But when I do, I use a hell lot of water! | And I shower with water so hot I could burn my skin.  r / DrunkThoughts
wxcazee	Sometimes I like to think that my family is just an hallucination and I'm like Wall-E: Alone in my appartment for infinity since infinity. Depression is helluvadrug. | [removed]
wxcazee	Describe in one sentence how a low dose of Kratom makes you feel | [removed]
wxcazee	Beautiful
wxcazee	What drugs gave you the most satisfying shit ever? | For me :  weed. Also, caffeine when you didn't shit for 2 days.  Seriously, shitting while on drugs is an underrated pleasure.
wxcazee	I'm not sure
wxcazee	Kratom makes me feel normal though I have no tolerance? | I get no euphoria from kratom. However, I feel... "normal"?  It's strange to not feel lethargic. Just being able get off my bed and walk.  I feel calm. Able. I feel silence. What is normal anyway?
wxcazee	Do you suffer from any mental illness? Narcolepsy? I know someone who takes coffee+amps just to get up in the morning. 
wxcazee	"Comfirm" | 
wxcazee	It was a kratom 15x extract, I took 0.5 grams every two days. I didn't feel like it was a high dose, as I didn't get the euphoria, only the anxiety suppression
wxcazee	I don't think so. But I have a grandfather with dementia I think.
wxcazee	Can Kratom worsen hypnagogic hallucinations? | It may simply be a coincidence. I feel like my closed eye visuals are much more clear and the patterns are much more sharp since I started to take kratom. They can be freaky sometimes.  Also, sometimes I hear noises as if a phone fell from a table. Or I wake up because someone seemed to ring the doorbell. It sounded very real and it only happens when I'm half-awake or half-asleep. I read on Wikipedia that it is perfectly normal to have this kind of hallucinations.  When it happens at night, it really freaks me out. Sometimes I see a humanoid shadow in the corner of my eye and I turn back and realize it's just a pile of clothes. It may seem stupid but its really scary when it happens and it only lasts 0.1 seconds.
wxcazee	Withdrawal symptoms after only 3 uses? | I tried kratom 3 times this month. It gave me a feeling of calmness but no euphoria. The 3rd time I felt nothing except anger. I always took it on an empty stomach, then ate a small snack.  I am experiencing what looks and feel like kratom withdrawal symptoms. (Can't copy paste).
wxcazee	I always thought depression was a normal part of growing up. Just like growing taller and having more teeth... | How could I be so blind?
wxcazee	My sister told me she was pregnant. She was happy as fuck. I didn't give a fuck. | 
wxcazee	Anyone else feel no euphoria from Alcohol, Kratom and L-theanine, only intense anger? | Is it me? Or is it normal from time to time?  I rarely take alcohol or kratom. Maybe thrice a month (not mixed). I have a very low tolerance to these substances (I think). So how is it possible that I get no pleasure from them?
wxcazee	How to know if you're emotionally blunt? I don't care about terror attacks. | How do you know you are emotionally blunt if you have no way to compare your emotions to your "normal" state since you are depressed for so long that you don't remember how it feels like to be normal?  If I don't give a fuck about terror attacks, does that mean I am a monster? Even though I dislike terrorists?  I don't know
wxcazee	My sister is like a stranger to me
wxcazee	How to know if you are depressed if you are too lazy to see a professional? | 
wxcazee	When drugs and painkillers have no effect at all | 
wxcazee	I took L-theanine on a Saturday morning and I didn't take caffein the day before.
wxcazee	I tried kratom. It is a really powerful drug. And it doesn't feel like a "drug", it really feels like a medicine. I don't get euphoria from kratom but I really feel the peacefulness and silence.  However, I am afraid I can't take kratom for my everyday anxiety because it decreases my overall cognitive performance (while high) and I work as a programmer. It's a drug after all.
wxcazee	Does that mean it wasn't L-theanine?
throwthisawaynerdboy	Can't. | I don't want to do this alone. 
throwthisawaynerdboy	more like a witch! burn him! burn him at the stake! He turned me into a newt!
throwthisawaynerdboy	no, i think you're thinking of "glitter and cum"

throwthisawaynerdboy	amen to that. if i dont eat at work, dinner is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a glass of hot-honey whiskey on the rocks. and its fabulous.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Pineapples are the devil's dildos.

throwthisawaynerdboy	This made me laugh so hard I woke my room mate up. We both then proceeded to laugh for about ten minutes after that. We kept reading it like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski.

throwthisawaynerdboy	Hi! I'm located in the US, and looking to trade. | [removed]
throwthisawaynerdboy	*claps*  But seriously. I am always willing to lend a hand. or two. or mouth. to a reptilian dong in need. because one day, it could be my dong in need.
throwthisawaynerdboy	hey T-Rex Boner....does that mean you're......untouchable?  or unflappable. 
throwthisawaynerdboy	Now that's what I call comedy bang bang!!
throwthisawaynerdboy	My dignity. Failing that, this super awesome silver surfer tshirt that I swear my ex did something with. 
throwthisawaynerdboy	So is fear pee. Its hotter and burnier than normal pee. So yes. Fear pee (and some discretion) are parts of valor. Better is subjective.
throwthisawaynerdboy	PSA: Robotics Expert hacking from afar! | You can hack a robot from a distance by looking at it through your gun scope. Great for sabotage. Just set a protectron out walking around, wait in the shadows, and hack to either incite or initiate self destruct. Did this with a sentry bot once. Fun times!

throwthisawaynerdboy	You show me a freezing flamer and I'll show you Nathan Lane on an iceberg.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Yup, same here. Just think its something my character would do.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Yes. All I wanna do is hide and check my inventory. Not asking much.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Nice to see a fellow shotgunner. You can all keep your fancy lasers, nothing is quite as good as psycho jet vatsing someone's head clean off with a shotty.
throwthisawaynerdboy	He tried to have sex with the wind and the rain, banged a pulpit in a church, and an electric chair. I dont think a dude locked in a room with him is going to be that far of a stretch.  Heh, stretch.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Agreed. Always stuck in my head when I'm not playing. 
throwthisawaynerdboy	Least, it would be....except fallout. :-P
throwthisawaynerdboy	I just pick up everything. I'm like an autastic guy just scouring the commonwealth for literally anything I can pick up. I've tagged every resource.

throwthisawaynerdboy	A question about bobbleheads, youre special, and stats.... | So, we basically all know you can raise all your stats to 11, if you get the bobbleheads after you get your stats to ten. And if the youre special book raises one of your stats one point as well, does that mean you can have one stat at 12, and the rest at 11? (not taking into account bonuses from gear, obvs )

throwthisawaynerdboy	I want my power armor to have its own set of armored nipples.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Agreed! As a bald guy, I'm always disappointed when that's not an option. Been bald for most of my life, and a good portion of my gaming life. It just seems like such a no brainer to me.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Ahh, thanks!
throwthisawaynerdboy	Thanks!
throwthisawaynerdboy	I had actually preordered both, played the beta for battlefront and then cancelled my preorder for battlefront and put the money toward Fallout 4. It wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't good enough for me to buy it only a week after. I mean, maybe in three weeks once I get through all 400 hours of gameplay. :-P
throwthisawaynerdboy	Question: I've heard you rip your pip boy off the arm of a dead scientist | Apparently this was in a video I missed. Or its just wild speculation? Am confused plz hep. Sorry I dumb

throwthisawaynerdboy	I took mine to the vet to get spayed, and they said if I needed to bring her back due to complications, they were going to have to charge me fifty extra dollars to put her under because she was "really fiesty", according to the vet tech. I'm so proud she lived up to her namesake. I can picture her weapon x style tearing vet techs to shreds. 
throwthisawaynerdboy	Holy shit. I too have a cat that looks just like this with the name Harley Quinn. Had she been a boy, Harvey Dent.
throwthisawaynerdboy	A question about side quests vs main story (possible spoilers) | I was just curious to know what everyone thought, is it better to finish all the side quests first and then the main story, or vice versa? I know the dialogue for side quests changes post main story and I was wondering if it was worth it to do one before the other,and how the dialogue affected the game any.
throwthisawaynerdboy	Yeah buffalo woooooo! Same here!
throwthisawaynerdboy	I'm a guy, but I just had to comment and say I love that you have an equal respect for mr pibb as I do. Dr. Pepper is fine, I guess, but side by side deliciousness test goes to Mr Pibb every god damn time.
Throwaway033292293	What do you do if it doesn't get better? | 
neprasta420	NEVER, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, PSYCHOANALYZE YOURSELF IF YOU'RE IN A BAD PLACE | Tried to analyze myself and my problems. Ended up blaming everything that has ever happened around me onto myself and walked away from it hating myself even more.
neprasta420	Slowly being pushed into considering suicide. | I feel every little shred of my sanity unraveling under the constant strain of shit going wrong, people hating you, disappointing everyone that's supposed to care about you and all the other horse-fuckery that keeps piling itself onto that ever growing heap. Just slowly losing every hope I ever held. Don't know if I'm looking for help, consolation or what, just needed to express that frustration, because the few people who I could have vented to, don't hold me in a any standing where they would be willing to help anymore.
neprasta420	Sometimes, parents' words should be treated with contempt, especially if it fucks your life over.
neprasta420	Shitty bitch doesn't deserve an inkling of affection and fuck that sleazeball of an asshole friend. Honestly reading this, it feels like that bitch was using you to get at your friend man. hope the heartache wards off soon. :) 
neprasta420	Here to... best place to put some order to disorganized thoughts.
neprasta420	You're 15 I'm guessing, given that you said you are in the 10th. Firstly, stop cutting your wrists, yes, I understand the replacing emotional anguish with physical pain argument, but, clearly in your case, you can't seem to supplant the anguish, so aren't you only, subjecting yourself to 2 different pains. Secondly, again, you're fifteen, trust me little man, these girlies you've been "dating", nowhere near what a real relationship will feel like when you have the emotional maturity to understand its implications, that's still a few years down the line, by the way. Next, friends trying to leave the group, kid you'll realize soon enough, everybody has got to do what is right by them, is it a betrayal? Yes. but they were able to lower themselves to carry out that betrayal, so the question you need to ask yourself here is, where they ever actually trustworthy. If not, what's there to be hurt about. If they were, well, not much that can be done besides taking it all in your stride and moving on. so, no. don't kill yourself kid, life is long and none of the damage done is irreparable, you have a long road ahead of you to become happy and find friendship, love and acceptance.
neprasta420	I'm not much older than you man, all I can say is, don't do it. you're young and have a lot to live for. And about all those issues, bad grades nothing learned and wasted time, try a little harder, yes, it feels right now like no amount of effort can do any good but it will, trust me. Friends lost, okay this I cannot abjectly give you a good answer to, but, if it was a very close friend you lost, think about what changed and why that affected your relation, if its trivial there's a chance, that kid wasn't really your friend, if it was a major spat, can it be reconciled? if not, move on and let the past lay where it is, you make a lot of better friends when you're a little older. And finally video games, bro, you're 16, you're supposed to be hooked on video games, but that ties back to all the education kerfuffle earlier, manage your time well, those 4 problems will resolve themselves together. All the best and I hope to never see you here again. You still have a life to live. Go live it. 
neprasta420	I literally cried reading that because I empathize so deeply with it. Felling that elation and having it ripped away so suddenly leaves a deep mark.  
neprasta420	I would again like to draw your attention to "if you're in a bad place". That darkness is oppressive, left me feeling... unable to feel good about myself. When I was able to clear my head a bit and get out of that funk, I saw it for what it was, assholes trying to diminish my sense of self-worth. 
neprasta420	Previous experience man, just thought it would be good to share the experience and stop someone following in the tragedy.
neprasta420	I probably am, but that's my point, being in that black hole made me blame every wrong around me onto myself, to some extent even projecting negative character traits of these toxic acquaintances onto myself. 
neprasta420	Love from Nepal friend. I care.
neprasta420	Thanks for the kind words, hope I can, been on a slow burn for a while though, only recently found the means to express the discontent.
neprasta420	I can definitely empathize with this my friend. sometimes, no matter what you do, it feel unappreciated and leaves you feeling like shit
neprasta420	if your question is that people who are playing using apk downloads being banned then i doubt it since i believe niantic themselves released the apks to various websites
neprasta420	around where on sanepa height did you find the bulbasaur i need candy to evolve my current bulbasaur
neprasta420	i'm sorry if i seemed rude, i was just making a comparison between how different it is between here and there
neprasta420	its more like the bud is potent but we don't have very good growers so you've got seeded bud and stuff, but its pretty strong
neprasta420	it looks like his kief has a lot of plant matter though
neprasta420	i live in Nepal, i score an ounce for $3-4
neprasta420	you got that for 10 bucks, i live in nepal, for 10 bucks i got an ounce of that bud 
bikramxo	I feel lonely. | :(
bikramxo	I'm feeling suicidal. | I hate my life so much. 
bikramxo	I agree with this. Thank you. 
bikramxo	I guess 
bikramxo	I hate my appearance, I hate myself, I don't know what I'm doing with my life, no one likes me, I have no friends, I fear for my future. Everything is just a mess right now. 
bikramxo	It sucks :(
bikramxo	Thank you. I hope you get through this too. 
bikramxo	Thank you ❤️
bikramxo	Do you agree IYRTITL is one of Drake's best? | I know it's just a mixtape, but I personally prefer it over views and more life. 
bikramxo	I feel your pain. 
bikramxo	We all are :(
bikramxo	Me too
bikramxo	I feel you completely.
bikramxo	No
bikramxo	Cool. I like more modern hip-hop like Eminem, Drake and Kendrick Lamar. 
bikramxo	It's not scary here at all. 
bikramxo	Pop, r&b and hip-hop.
bikramxo	Na bro
bikramxo	I'm 19 and live in the UK. Wbu? 
bikramxo	Does anyone else deactivate social media when depressed? | I often deactivate Facebook and Instagram when I feel depressed because I hate seeing how good everyone's lives are compared to mine, and I like deactivating social media because it gives me space away from everything, and I can be left alone. 
bikramxo	I agree. 
bikramxo	Okay I'll give it a try. 
bikramxo	It's been pretty rough in London since these attacks. I love listening to music. 
bikramxo	I'm getting small breakouts again, | I've been off accutane for 8 months now and my skin is clear, but I've been getting small breakouts recently. My skin is normal, not too oily or dry. I wash my face twice a day in the morning and before I sleep with just water, but I'm beginning to think I should maybe use a cleanser, maybe that would help with the breakouts. Any ideas on what I should do? 
bikramxo	I'm sorry for your loss.
bikramxo	I thought I was the only one who does this. 
bikramxo	Personally I think it's useful and entertaining sometimes, but most times I don't like being on it. 
bikramxo	Nowadays I just use my phone to listen to music too.
bikramxo	What does the album title "beauty behind the madness" actually mean? | Is the title of the album describing Abel's lifestyle or something?
bikramxo	I agree with this. 
bikramxo	I understand. The only reason I really stopped is because summer arrived and I didn't want to have to constantly cover up my cuts or scars by wearing long sleeves.
bikramxo	Thank you for your kind words. 
bikramxo	I feel like cutting | :(
bikramxo	Please don't cut. I'm here if you need to talk to someone. 
bikramxo	Please stop doing it. I hope everything works out for you and I hope you find the happiness you deserve. 
bikramxo	Lmao stay pressed 😂
bikramxo	I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold 
bikramxo	Very true.
bikramxo	I feel like self harming again. | In January I relapsed after 10 months. I stopped again in March, but now I feel like self harming again. How do I stop these urges? 
bikramxo	Don't forget shameless.
bikramxo	Honest opinion on beauty behind the madness? | I think it's under appreciated to be honest.
bikramxo	My favourite Beyoncé album is self titled and my favourite song on there is "mine". 
bikramxo	Everyone under appreciates XO 😔
bikramxo	I feel like no one likes me | I try to talk to people, but no one takes any interest in me. I don't really have any friends or anyone to talk to and it makes me sad. 
bikramxo	I'm 19 years old. I feel like I'm wasting my youth being sad and lonely when I should be out there in the world doing fun things and meeting new people. 
bikramxo	What to do when you are feeling depressed again? | 
bikramxo	Thank you 
bikramxo	I feel so low right now | :( 
bikramxo	What do we know about Eminem's new album so far? | [removed]

Arra_y	Fear of hell? | I really really really wanna kill myself but I know that if I kill myself I will go to hell. Man it's the worst form of trap. But I am going to hell anyways so why not just make it faster? is hell worse than this? Man I wish I wasn't born religious would've been dead years ago.
Arra_y	people who have smoked | would u compare pmo addiction to masterbation addiction
Arra_y	What was your "This n!gga gay" moment? | 
Arra_y	Chrome keeps crashing | I have been a chrome user for a long time but however during the past maybe 6 months I have been experiencing a consistent crash. the crash happens randomly maybe 10 times a day. It happens while I am on youtube, reading an article/ pdf etc or doing anything else. I am contemplating between switching to Firefox.
Arra_y	I have adblocker,video downloader professional , tampermonkey, 
Arra_y	5'8 and below is short
Arra_y	Dude don't over think it.  Yea being short sucks but there are people who are tall but can't walk. there are people 6'7 who can't get off bed. be happy at least that you can stay healthy
Arra_y	Why you shouldn't work out as a short guy! | 
Arra_y	Please help me! | I am a college student and masturbation will screw my grades like it did last semester. Here is how instead of studying here is how I spend my free days.    - wakeup  - feel excited eat breakfast  - study for about 2 hours   - after that the urge to masturbate starts  - I go to bed to lay down  - get up force my self to study  - the urge is too strong  - take a hot bath  - eat lunch  - at around noon give to the urge and masterbate  - get overwhelmed with guilt and go to sleep.  I had so many ambitions this semester but this addiction is gonna stop me from reaching it! 
Arra_y	How can I develop the kinks to want it more?
Arra_y	How to become submissive male? | Hi, I really want to become a submissive male. The idea of enjoying women controlling, giving ruined orgasms and such are very appealing but I am no a sub male. What can I do to develop this fetish further if you will. Thank you
Arra_y	Do whatever you gotta do to get the job done.
Arra_y	if you have hgh deficiency tho
Arra_y	Haha midget aint sexy. midget a midget XD
Arra_y	fuk off
Arra_y	Honestly don't ignore it. Just realize that this a battle you have been assigned with in your life. 
Arra_y	"Be khanifident!"
Arra_y	We will recieve those comments. But first let's get in the "heightism doesn't exist" comments out of the way 
Arra_y	hmm, he thinks he superior
Arra_y	How tall was the person
Arra_y	another advantage of being short. People will realize you are less of a man and treat you like a kid XD
Arra_y	piss off mate
Arra_y	I agree with you 100% 
Arra_y	he is mentally ill
Arra_y	taking growth hormones don't make you tall idiot. Why do you like to belittle short people?
Arra_y	"growth hormones can make you taller"  you are tall so you just randomly troll here. please gtfo
Arra_y	sigh. Whatever dude. I am done at this point. I am just hoping that one day genetics can be modified and short people get the option to get tall. 
Arra_y	you are mentally ill. 
Arra_y	This guy is a troll and hates short men. Please get a life I have reported you already
Arra_y	you are probably above 5'10 so you wouldn't understand
Arra_y	Why you should date short men. Despite what society has taught you through heightism. | 
Arra_y	it will only make you tall if you have hgh deficiency. please stop hating short men. Enjoy your flock of women and leave us alone.
Arra_y	it will only make you tall if you have hgh deficiency. please stop hating short men. Enjoy your flock of women and leave us alone.
Arra_y	society teaches women to discriminate against short men 
Arra_y	countries would write in books about how the men of another country were short eventho they werent just to paint a pic of imfiriority
Arra_y	so then why cant racists  choose who they live with?
Arra_y	I know right 5'6 is not short for women. The fact that she seeks out a short people forum and then bitch about how short guys feel when she is not even short herself shows she hates short men. I wish I could down vote her
Arra_y	If I had to guess you are above 5'10 and want short people to feel like they are not facing heightism and that being short is not a problem. you want to do this because you don't want scientists and researchers  to find solutions to make individuals increase in height in a safe way.  there are people in india getting their shins busted open just so they can increase a few inches but you don't care about those people do you?   Instead of trying to act like heightsim doesn't exist. give people hope in the future that things will be better and science will find a way to make people taller.
Arra_y	Women should be blind to height. height just like color you can't change. Would it be ok for a guy or girl to discriminate against different races?  how would it look like if a guy tells a girl "Hey I don't wanna be with you because you are too pale for my taste". That would be shallow and judgmental. heightism is an accepted form of stereotyping bullying of society.
Arra_y	through out human history short men are considered inferior.
Arra_y	no some people are born in a racist neighborhood and can't change who they are taught to discriminate against.
Arra_y	Another lady on tinder | 
Arra_y	atleat you can change those traits. you can't change height  
Arra_y	Drank a ton of milk. All I gained from it is a bladder full of piss 
Arra_y	wow....
Arra_y	Well you are just reapeting what i am saying. Women shouldnt choose one height over the other. Please dont repeat me lol
Arra_y	Well of course that is what i am saying. I agree with you 100%. Women shouldn't hold as a criteria. I had this girl once tell me that she doesn't want to marry a short guy because she doesn't want to infect her gene or her offsprings. How do you think that makes a person feels. :(
Arra_y	I am pretty sure leg lengthening is the only scientific way to increase height at the moment.
Arra_y	no one should wear snapbacks
Arra_y	Yes that is true
Arra_y	Welcome brother, thats part of being short
Arra_y	no, just eat your veggies drink your milk and you will reach 6ft before you know it. You won't have to deal with the disability of being short 
Arra_y	yea
Arra_y	Awesome dud. link it up
Arra_y	you are ignorant of heightism. being 5'7 is not that bad. imagine if your dad was 5'2 do you think height would not be a problem for him? Since you are above average you are blind to heightism. 
Arra_y	Yes I agree with them
Arra_y	you are probably over 6ft...
Arra_y	I was going down on my grandma and tasted horse semen, so I though "oh, that's how she died!"
Arra_y	I will be independent soon.
Arra_y	I am originally from a small town and my family is known for being tall. my uncles are really tall so are my cousins. So having someone so short is like having a streak breaker in the family 
Arra_y	see my comment history
Arra_y	Yea anime is just like those naruto shows. I personally think naruto is the worst anime ever to be made.
Arra_y	Family guy peter becomes 6'3 ! | 
Arra_y	What does my comment history tell you about me? | [removed]
Arra_y	I was going down on my grandma and tasted horse semen, so I though "oh, that's how she died!"
Arra_y	my uncles say things like "come sit on my lap",they carry me cuz i am skinny and they just piss me off
Arra_y	The average height in the us is around 5'10. I agree that people 5'10 and above shouldn't really worry about height. they can literally just say they are 6ft and be believed. however when you are 5'5 for instance. everyone comments on your height. My family comments on my height a lot and I wanna kms.
Arra_y	It's the fact that you need to eat fecal matter daily. Eat fecal matter buba
Arra_y	stfu
Arra_y	you look like a muslim. You islam diareah eater shit fart eater. looks like you got some fecal matter on you
Arra_y	I agree with you 100% brother
Arra_y	"little missery". ok nice one. I don't care if my life wastes away. I think it would have been better if I had died the moment I stoped growing XD. Please someone on this sub dox me and kill me please.
Arra_y	When you ask his height and it begins with 6' | 
Arra_y	what do you mean?
Arra_y	I was going down on my grandma and tasted horse semen, so I though "oh, that's how she died!"
Arra_y	sound like you are a homo. Go eat fecal matter or maybe sodomize your fraternity brother. 
Arra_y	You can start by eating fecal matter and feces. Also why are you desperately seeking fart sniffing?
Arra_y	Deport all immigrants. We need to deport immigrants. Eat fecal matter op. Eat fecal matter for me please shemale. you are a shemale chaser
Arra_y	All of you here are shemale chasers and fart sniffers. Stop sniffing fart you butt eaters
Arra_y	Just blew a thick feces for this shithead 8===D I sharted for her lol. I let loose some fecal matter | 
Arra_y	No need to roast you. islam has already done that
Arra_y	Read my post history. | [removed]
Arra_y	haha it's much like naruto the worst anime ever. Anime sucks and those who watch it have mental illness. Anime is getting shut down. Anime sucks
Arra_y	no every country is obsessed with height.
Arra_y	hahahahah you are funny. hahahahaahha you are very funny lol I haven't laughed like this in years lol you are the funniest person on this sub. We need more people like you bro. keep up the good work!!
Arra_y	fact
Arra_y	There is no need to explain it dude. If a female asks your height tell her "7" and before she says another word say "uncut" or "cut"
Arra_y	Feces on my feet
Arra_y	hahahahaha
Arra_y	gtfo go to /tall you asshole mother fucker
Arra_y	aww lol
Arra_y	is it funny?
Arra_y	yea, lack of dating is the only thing short men face..
Arra_y	yea, lack of dating is the only thing short men face..
Arra_y	I relate dude. 
Arra_y	"whiny little boys", well, what do you call someone who shops at the "boys" section
Arra_y	I sharted and farted on their feet. then a block of feces came out and I sharted alot. then I pissed fart. I farted sharted and spread my feces . I let out my feces to the air and let my feces run like rain.
Arra_y	I kid you not this happened! | 
Arra_y	tall men vs short men | 
lproxsme18	okay then yes you did the right thing. There isn't much else you can probably do from there. I hope your friend turns out okay and good job at looking out for her.
lproxsme18	yeah i have felt it before... right now it just feels empty and doesn't hurt but i know it will eventually.
lproxsme18	you live near a cliff that you could fall off of and die?
lproxsme18	yeah anytime you have a real concern for someones safety you should reach out. Has she ever admitted to suicidal thoughts or actions? Did she ever say she would hurt herself or kill herself?
lproxsme18	no death is painless 
lproxsme18	that is a very slow painful and unlikely death... i have seen some really awful attempts and god its just makes me sick to look at it. For your own sake do not try to do this.
lproxsme18	i have a plan but no day. | and the thoughts are only getting worse, they are constant now but i still feel so empty, i wish i could feel the darkness that is hovering over me. i hope i can fall into the deep depression soon so i will have the motive to end it. im so tired of living.
lproxsme18	ive wanted to kill myself since i was 9... so lets say about 20 years ive wanted to end it. Ive tried and it's not easy to do it, thats why im still here. But each attempt i get better at it. I think if i attempt again im not going to fuck up.
lproxsme18	me too
lproxsme18	yeah i figure im either going to get myself killed, snap and kill someone, or kill myself. I have thought of so many fucked up things. ive thought about going to school with a fake gun and taking an officer's real one. ive gotten roadrage and wanted to kill someone with my car. ive almost snapped and wanted to stab someone. Disclaimer (i have thought about theses things but never done them, and would never do them)
lproxsme18	depends on the method... most attempts are painful in some way or another but if you combine 2 different attempts then you will almost definitely succeed.  
lproxsme18	well thats good! sounds like things are going better than they were before.
lproxsme18	your welcome 
lproxsme18	thanks but i dont think im running a normal race, its more of a marathon and im going to just quit and be glad i made it as far as i could 
lproxsme18	yep baby steps! its alway hard for the first few months to get used to stuff just like any other change in your life. 
lproxsme18	wow sorry you are feeling so bad. i wish i knew what to say to this... maybe all i can offer is to listen.
lproxsme18	naw maybe this teacher is just wack, it wont mess up the rest of college for you
lproxsme18	wow thats weird... idk if i have ever heard of such a thing. Have you seen anyone about all this???   also im curious, do you feel like being as smart as you are as a curse? Like do you ever wish you were more average?
lproxsme18	do you have your GED you could probably do the test to get it so you can find work
lproxsme18	thats cool i live in California, that is on the west coast, its below Oregon. I hear it is very pretty there. Have you looked into joining so groups to get to know people. Colleges usually have lots of clubs   
lproxsme18	thanks... but no one else responded so im not really convinced
lproxsme18	that may be true but it takes a long time to see improvement. think of depression as being like getting healthy and losing weight. going to the gym for 8 days doesn't get you results... it has to be constant before you see a difference, and you have to slowly make a lifestyle change, thats the hardest part 
lproxsme18	i dont have a date but i know how. | ive have had depression for 13 years and ive attempted suicide a couple of times. I know i will end it someday but i dont have a date set. I have several methods, and the one I used last time would have worked if someone hadn't have found me. Just felt like i had to get it off my chest.  
lproxsme18	do you see a therapist? maybe talking it out would help you more than pills. They give pills to keep you from flipping out its not a solution but a temporary fix to a complex problem. Most people take pills and do talk therapy. 
lproxsme18	thanks and you too.
lproxsme18	why tomorrow? any reason why?
lproxsme18	God doesn't really do this stuff to us in my opinion. I feel like maybe he does the good but life, society, genetics, people do the evil. Maybe god is more of an observer because if he did control all aspects of our life then that would mean we have no free will. That would also mean we are either destined for happiness or sadness. That would mean that god made Hitler with the sole intention of killing his own people. 
lproxsme18	i understand how you feel. lack of energy and being lazy is part of depression. I know no one seems to understand that as im getting the same stuff thrown at me too. Your family just doesn't understand its not your fault its your depression. People snap at you and say mean things but a lot of times they dont mean it.
lproxsme18	its 3am... i have no job, no life, no school, if i stay up late i dont have to "live" or deal with people.
lproxsme18	okay and no problem, there is a lot of support going on on those sites and a lot of fans sharing stories, positive messages, and hope.
lproxsme18	yeah, im kinda in a I want to be depressed mood right now too. You probably think of it as happy as it is something you know you should have enjoyed. 
lproxsme18	I don't know when but I want to do it. | ive have had depression for 13 years and ive attempted suicide a couple of times. I know i will end it someday but i dont have a date set. I have several methods, and the one I used last time would have worked if someone hadn't have found me. Just felt like i had to get it off my chest. I dont need advice.
lproxsme18	Formosa??? had to google it... so i guess its what Americans call Taiwan? you said you are going to school here. What state you living in and what school are you going too? what are your studies?  
lproxsme18	okay that makes sense... as you could probably tell im from 'Merica! so probably what you call i think... university??? is what we call college...
lproxsme18	there is joy but no such thing as true happiness... no one is constantly happy. We more or less cycle through moods, so there are seconds to days where you experience joy, sadness, anger, satisfied ect. We just aren't feeling the other feeling.
lproxsme18	damn... sorry life is treating you like shit.  Do you mind if i ask how things ended up the way it is currently?
lproxsme18	write it down and hand it to the therapist. 
lproxsme18	what do you do for a living?
lproxsme18	what country are you from?
lproxsme18	you could be my friend?
lproxsme18	things may change... I have a memory that i wish i could relive. I got to see my favorite band live and meet them in person backstage. I was tired and so unexcited for some reason like i wasn't even enjoying myself... Now the lead singer is dead and i will never have another chance again to meet him.
lproxsme18	this is your chance to show everyone that you are 10 times better than them. the best way to hurt people is by surpassing them and proving them wrong. you feel like shit so what do you have to lose?
lproxsme18	how are you in college at 16???
lproxsme18	lol it would... its been awhile since i took psych so i don't know if i described it right but essentially your brain is like lets just kinda shut down. the word brain fog is used to describe what you are probably experiencing, its something people with depression get.
lproxsme18	have you been to any of Linkin Park websites, or follow twitter for them or his wife? they are doing a lot in the wake of his death. Lots of suicide awareness stuff posted.I think the hashtag they are using is #fuckdepression. I know what you mean, i have had quite a few relatives pass over the last couple years.   "erase myself, and let go of what ive done...."  "Put to rest what you thought of me While I clean this slate With the hands of uncertainty" 
lproxsme18	good for you for being a gentlemen.
lproxsme18	why fuck me??? well it depends on who you are and what you look like... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   jk but i am a female... unless you are a girl or a gay guy then its not going to work out. 
lproxsme18	thanks lol it was like 4am or something... its 3:30 am right now... anyway i get all weird when im up late.
lproxsme18	ha your username is funny... but in all seriousness i feel ya.
lproxsme18	i don't think reproducing is immoral but i don't want kids and there are wayyy to many people in this world. im all for less people and children. The earth can't sustain our population and we are ruining what we have left.
lproxsme18	yes its like your brain is dying in a way...you have these transmitters in your brain and it sends messages and stuff. When you are depressed your connections slow down and parts kinda stop working. look up images of the brain on depression vs normal 
lproxsme18	it is isn't it....i just realized how weird that is its like part of the sentence is just repeated backwards. 
lproxsme18	i miss him :( 
lproxsme18	Thank you. There is a stigma attached to mental illness... usually the only ones that reach out to us are other depressed people or people who work in the field of psychology. Most people dont want to talk about it or even hear about it, let alone acknowledge that what we feel is real. You're experiencing depression and you're reaching out to this community with new understanding, we really do appreciate it when people like you let us know that "you get it."  hope things go better at your new job, and you know maybe this will be a better fit for you even though you are upset about the job you just lost. Take care of yourself and good luck
lproxsme18	fuck what??? why are we yelling fuck???
lproxsme18	im curious how our info and identities are protected. If you submit this info and DNA will it be available to 3rd party use. So could the info be used against us. We know that in the US, idk if anything has changed yet, that insurance companies, banks, employers, law enforcement ect have access to your personal information possibly including medical records. They can use this against you to discriminate. That means that if they deem you "high risk" they might not approve you of loans, give you higher quotes, refuse to offer services, ect
lproxsme18	it also depends on the severity of the depression... some people experience just feeling a bit down while others are in their own personal hell.  my boyfriend has the feeling down and crappy and gets really sad on occasion but he doesn't have it as bad as me. I have really bad spells of depression with suicidal thoughts and attempts.   So it can vary from person to person too
lproxsme18	when that happens you got to leave the room and let yourself calm down. Breath... its important. you could also go to see your therapist if you have one or read about how to better manage anger.  I know what you are going through. i get crazy mad, luckily i haven't hurt anyone but i have been close. I get horrible road rage. and once i got so mad at my father i went into the kitchen and was fully prepared to either stab him or me.  fyi im female so it can happen to anyone, its not like you know only a guy thing.
lproxsme18	that girl... she is so stupid... if you are fucked up dont go to get more alcohol to get more fucked up. then she flirts...omg please don't think we are all terrible people... some of us are just stupider than others. I would never do something like that and im sorry that happened to you. 
lproxsme18	your username... are you the swed???
lproxsme18	i have video games that im not even playing i just lay in bed and stare at my computer
lproxsme18	wow, thats kinda weird. i had a bad relationship with a teacher once in college. im snarky and a smartass and would make dumb comments to my friend. I would be sarcastic and i guess he didn't understand and would get angry. I think he was going through some shit and just could not even at the time. It was only after i missed some class and had to come in with a note from a hospital that he let up. I think he felt bad after that and was super nice to me.
lproxsme18	that doesn't mean you dont believe in critical thinking... that doesn't even make sense.
lproxsme18	oh man you got me... i know, i keep getting talks about how i stay in my room all day on the internet... ughhh I guess im sucking at hiding it.
lproxsme18	my family doesnt even joke they just come in and scold me like im 10 for being on the computer
lproxsme18	i know, people love you and care about you, you just cant feel it.
lproxsme18	it would be better to raise it again than to suffer and kill yourself.
lproxsme18	yep... like i said im not meaning to sound rude. You do kinda make me think of the character. Do you talk the way you write???
lproxsme18	i didn't mean for it to sound offensive i'm not good with words. I mean that most people are probably below your thinking level so you got to work with them, just like we do with children. You can talk to a child even though they do not have the same knowledge as an adult.
lproxsme18	but we're talking college so no one can make you stop going or drop unless you like punch someone in class or whatever
lproxsme18	what did you write?
lproxsme18	yep 
lproxsme18	Tell her to stay calm and do what they ask, if she acts normal and follow directions they will let her go. Also she has the right to speak to a patient's rights advocate. They would be the ones that could call a hearing and ask that she be let go. 
lproxsme18	yeah i guess it is part of the disease 
lproxsme18	that likely wont work but will make you regret you did. I wish i could die too but im not going to do it where i live cus i live with my family.
lproxsme18	what is your diagnosis??? No offence but you come off as narcissistic which would make people not want to interact with you. I understand that you want to be and talk with people who are equally smart but not everyone is a freaking genius or whatever.   You sound like Sherlock Homes from the BBC show with Benedict Cumberbatch. 
lproxsme18	why would they do that??? why would they think that???
lproxsme18	have you ever seen a doctor? As far as love goes I know it hurts but you will go through many heartbreaks before you find someone you "love" and would want to be with.
lproxsme18	she needs to get help. If you don't want to go to her mother then go to someone at school, an adult, school counselor and tell them. She will be soo mad, but all threats of suicide need to be taken seriously 
lproxsme18	i have never heard of such a thing but idk if that is really going to do it for you... it might end up breaking you without the build up part. 
lproxsme18	in the states they can only break confidentiality if you are a threat to yourself and others. So if you did confess to like abusing a child or threatened to hurt yourself you lose your rights.
lproxsme18	I LOVE LINKIN PARK! Favorite band of all time. "cus i draw regret from the truth of a thousand lies, so let mercy come and wash away.... what ive done"  are you super depressed about Chester? I am too.
lproxsme18	thats really dramatic and sad. dont do that to the dog he/she loves you. Also parents can be awful but they love you too.
lproxsme18	why are you going to kill yourself?
lproxsme18	yep, well i mean if people are on the train that hits you they will see the bloodbath of a train hitting a body.
lproxsme18	because they are fucking stupid meat canoes who don't know what fucking emotions and sadness is.
lproxsme18	that is really hard. do you think you love him??? do you think you would want to be with him if he got better? 
lproxsme18	okay then you still have hope and thats good. Sorry to hear he is in such a bad place right now. Remember to take care of yourself too and stay clean. I know its a lot to try and help someone who is suffering and you are an amazing person for staying this long and saving his life. Even if things don't work out, keep your head up and know that you have given everything in you to get this far, never give up and never give in! Wishing you the best of luck, and that everything turns out good :D stay healthy k
lproxsme18	aww your so sweet! im a little teary eyed... anyway awesome! i'm a female idk if its apparent for some reason everyone assumes im a dude. And yeah feel free to chat whenever, im here about every day.
lproxsme18	no it makes sense to me. I have talked about stuff like this with others and its a common human fear. My mom thought the same thing when she was a kid. She was a kid when martin luther king jr. was assassinated, Kennedy was assassinated, and they were doing drills for a nuclear bomb incase Russia decided to kill us. All cold war crap.  we are kinda seeing the same thing again. Russia up to no good, crazy North Korea, all sorts of natural disasters and i wonder the same thing. Thing is, is we can't stop this from happening, we can't stop a meteor or anything but don't worry about it. If it happens it happens. It likely won't hurt if something like that happened because it would happen before you could blink. I just pray that if something bad like that happens, that it will be quick and painless.
lproxsme18	yeah my boyfriend has told me that. He tells me often that he wish he could kinda start over too. (we both have depression) I totally get where you are coming from.
lproxsme18	i know what you mean, i hate asking for it and i seldom want it. I know that its the healthy thing to do but i prefer to live in my misery. 
lproxsme18	thing is, you have to force yourself to do stuff now, that is what depression does to you. I have spent the whole summer just laying around on my bed and i am just now slowly trying to do the things i used to enjoy. I don't get the same satisfaction but at least im making an effort. I know that sucks to hear but over time you will like doing those things a little more.
lproxsme18	so you want to escape your life then... do you mean you want to die? or is it like going to sleep and not waking up again thing.
lproxsme18	well what did you like to do for fun?
lproxsme18	i know i often see my life ending like in 3rd person, fantasising about it. its like a movie in my head every time. I always see it in my head when i drive at night, just sitting at a stop light and imagining being hit and everything slows down and it just ends.
lproxsme18	but you ruin a lot of peoples lives like that... assuming by high speed you mean like the ones that commuters ride.
lproxsme18	so is this a girlfriend? like are you dating her? have you talked to anyone about this besides here? you seem maybe a little obsessed... do you think that may be it?
lproxsme18	yeah that is just how depression is. i keep coming here too and i find that i need help but i just don't feel like im getting it or that maybe I dont know what to say. I end up messaging other people all day and i just end up feeling sucky because its not enough
lproxsme18	yeah i know what you mean.
SAT01	I just need to know that someone cares :( | Please?
SAT01	What's so good about my grammar?
SAT01	I'm just in a bit of a shit situation socially. I have no friends and my family life is terrible as well. I'm 16 so I'm basically just holding my breath that high school will end soon and I can go to University and hopefully start over :)   Thanks for caring too ❤️
SAT01	I'm lonely, so I'm mainly just trying to meet people right now :/  Also thanks for caring - I really needed it today :)
SAT01	You don't seem like a particularly nice person based off of your post history :/
SAT01	Feel worse after socializing | Does anyone else feel worse after socializing and talking with others. I had to do a group project and I joined one that had my crush and a guy I know sort of well. I thought things were going well: my crush was laughing at like everything I was saying and the other two people seemed to like me as well. Towards the end of the period I started feeling like shit though. I realized that I was only making people laugh by putting some other guy down; and also that, in reality, none of these people cared about me at all - I was just comic relief I guess :( I literally have no real friends and I just can't seem to make any - it doesn't help either that whenever I do talk to people I just hate myself even more for some reason. 
SAT01	What cancelled video game do you wish was still going to come out? | 
SAT01	Heeyyyy - only 88 days away!!!
SAT01	I have a neurological condition called Neurofibromatosis Type 2. Basically just a bunch of non-cancerous tumours all over my body and in my head. It's one in 42,000 - so a lot less than 1% lol. 0.002% actually :)
SAT01	This made me really sad to read :(  Your wife sounds like she was a very strong person. Best of luck to you and your son going forward :)
SAT01	You're not alone. You have me and everyone else on this sub :)
SAT01	Do your families know about your PMO addiction? | My mom, dad, and brother all know about my issues lol.  Anyone else?
SAT01	I talked about it a bit with my dad and he understood pretty well what I was saying, though I don't think he really feels super strongly about it -  sort of a similar response to your mom I think. My mom and brother both know I think but we've never actually had a discussion about it or anything like that. I've just mentioned things off-hand, you know? My two best friends are both on NoFap so they're my primary outlet for this kinda thing.
SAT01	Fair enough
SAT01	Would you ever consider letting them know? It helps to have the support of your family, although I understand if maybe your not super close to them or think it might be more than a little uncomfortable.
SAT01	Is it normal for longer keys to feel a little different than others? | So I just got my first mechanical keyboard - a cherry MX Blue Ducky Zero - and I'm really enjoying it. It definitely feels a little strange coming from years of using nothing but membranes, but pretty neat nonetheless. A few of the keys, however, feel a bit different than others - namely the enter and backspace keys, which feel a tiny bit more mushy than the rest. Is this normal?  Thanks
SAT01	oh ok. Which would you say you prefer?  Thanks again (I'm typing extra cause it's just fun to type on lol)
SAT01	oh ok. How common are cherry stabilizers VS the alternative?  Sorry I'm kind of a mech noob honestly.   Thanks
SAT01	Question about installing an SSD | So I need to install an SSD into my PC, and I'm wondering if it's as simple as just connecting the SATA DATA and SATA Power, or whether there is anything else that I need to do - inside or outside of the OS. Also, do I need to format it, and if so, how?  Thanks and help is much appreciated!
SAT01	I love the movie. Perfect representation of being lost in life imo and making crazy choices thinking that they'll make you happy - though in reality they won't. All the shots of Ben floating through the pool are a perfect representation of what it feels like to be floating through life - something which I feel a lot of college grads can relate to. I'm 16 - so I haven't even started college - and I still related to it. Gonna have to disagree with Mr. Ebert on this one.
SAT01	Just relapsed....
SAT01	Thoughts on Ducky Keyboards? | I just wanted to know what your guys' opinions were on Ducky boards - whether they're any good etc. I've been in the market recently for my first mechanical keyboard, and I came across [this one](https://m.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/ducky-dk2108s-zero-shine-blue-cherry-mx-blue-led-mechanical-keyboard/10753269). It has the backlighting I want and the switch types I want as well. I also have a $100 best buy gift card which I need to use up anyways! It's also worth mentioning that I do live in Canada, and mechanical keyboards are quite scarce here - especially when shopping online.  Thanks!
SAT01	How much did you pay for it? Thanks for the help too man!
SAT01	I messaged you.
SAT01	Me too! What's ur favourite Wes Anderson movie - mine's Rushmore.  Also, what's your favourite Indie band?
SAT01	You sound a lot like me and I'm 16 (guy) as well. I've never had a penpal or anything like that though, but message me if you're interested in chatting!
SAT01	I can't find most cooler master boards anywhere (I live in Canada). That one is also quite expensive. 
SAT01	What about the Ducky Shine Zero? It's at best buy and I have a one hundred dollar gift card. Would that be a good one to go with?
SAT01	That last line made smile :) I'm 16 btw - just got diagnosed last year but had issues since birth. One of the tumours is pushing on my brain stem but I have some time left which is why they're pursuing treatment rather than surgery. I'm really sorry that you have to deal with all of this - and I really hope that it doesn't develop further in your case or cause you anymore unnecessary  pain. I too love music and the connection that I have with it; and the knowledge that I can't really experience it anymore to the degree that I used to - and that someday I probably won't be able to at all - does make me quite sad sometimes. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about better than almost anyone - like you said though: We're just special ;)  Good luck and I hope all goes well! 
SAT01	RoseWill RK-9300 VS Cooler Master MasterKeys Pro M | I'm trying to decide on my first mechanical keyboard. I like Cherry MX Blue and both of these boards have it, while still remaining fairly inexpensive. I think I'm leaning more towards the Rosewill one because the backlighting is blue and fits the rest of my setup; it also comes with what looks like a built in wrist rest - though I could be wrong about that. If you have any other suggestions then let me know please.  Thank you
SAT01	That's probably just because Corsair is such a popular brand, and because so many people use them. 
SAT01	Best No Frills Cherry MX Blue Keyboard? | Title says it all. Under 150$ Canadian would be good as well.  Thanks in advance!
SAT01	I have NF2 (Neurofibromatosis Type 2). I have two in my head - one of which is causing hearing loss - though there are many others as well all over the rest of my body. I have problems with vision and balance as well.
SAT01	Is it Neurofibromatosis? I have an acoustic shwannoma as well and I'm currently undergoing treatment with Avastin.   Thanks for the response and I hope all is well!
SAT01	Oh sorry about that. I'm okay with either full or 90%. I need a number pad.  I'll check out that thread too.
SAT01	oh I see
SAT01	I like that Corsair one but you can only get The Mx blues with red leds which kinda bothers me since the rest of my setup has blue leds.
SAT01	Hey. I know that this is an old post but I just wanted to ask you if you could tell me the exact name of your condition. I'm just wondering because what you described sounds a lot like the medical problems that I am currently undergoing. I too have hearing loss in one of my ears caused by tumours in my head, but I am undergoing treatment rather than getting surgery. My hearing in my left ear is almost gone, and the tumour is pushing on my brain stem as well. Haven't seen the movie but sounds good.  Thanks 
SAT01	What do you mean by lack of customization. Please correct me if I'm wrong but they seem incredibly customizable - atleast as far as what I've read.
SAT01	What's a good full size cherry mx blue keyboard under $150? 
SAT01	I have low self-esteem and low self worth so I belittle other people to make myself feel better.
SAT01	Why does this sub hate Corsair so much? | I've been spending a decent amount of time here and I see a lot of hate on Corsair that I've just never noticed anywhere else on the internet - or in real life for that matter. I don't own a Corsair board or anything like that - I'm just curious as to why they get so much hate around here.  Thanks  
SAT01	Thank you. This makes me feel a lot better :)
SAT01	I'm a terrible person | I'm mean to literally everyone. I legitimately don't know how to be a nice, kind hearted person - it's just not something I can do. And then I wonder why I have no friends and no one wants to be around me. I'm even mean to my own family, and they've done literally everything for me. When I say that they would be better off without me, I really mean it. They would be. Obviously if I died then they would be way worse off due to the grief surrounding my death - my mom has even gone as far as to say that if I died, she would kill herself - but if I just never existed and was never born then they absolutely would be - and that's not debatable. I'm even mean to my own dog - and he is the nicest, cutest dog probably ever to exist. I can't go more than 5 minutes without insulting someone. I just insulted my dad not 10 minutes ago, and I felt so bad about it that I went and cried in the bathroom for 10 minutes. But I'm gonna do it again, not because I want to - but because I don't know how not to. I treat the few friends I have left like shit too. I want to change so badly but this shitty behaviour has become so ingrained in me that I honestly feel like I can't at this point.  Just had to get this out.

SAT01	Dont care about sex really. Would rather cuddle...
SAT01	I think I'm going to do that as well. Get as far as I can in the Absolute Beginner level class and then just move on to the one you're talking about without finishing.
SAT01	Can you take as long as you want if the course is self paced? | I'm currently taking a course and it says that in 4 weeks the course content will be archived. It's a self paced course.  Thanks
SAT01	Question about course start dates | So there is a course I want to take in Python which starts on the 30th of August, however there are 2 other courses in Python which I would like to take before that one so as to gain a basic understanding of it. If I don't take the course that starts on August 30th, will I have to wait until August 30th next year to take it, or will it be available before then?  Sorry if this is an insanely dumb question  Thanks in advance

SAT01	could you please link it?  I googled it and there are a few  Thanks
SAT01	ELI5 Why will the solar eclipse burn my eyeballs if I look directly at it? | [removed]
SAT01	People say things that they don't mean when in states of extreme emotion. I can't tell you how many times I've told my parents or my brother that I hate them, only to feel remorse immediately after. And you know what, they always forgive me - because they know that I'm just being emotional, and that I don't actually mean it. You had every right to be angry with him - especially considering his history with alcoholism - and I think it's honestly time to let this go. Talk to him about it.  Hope this helps
SAT01	Alienated my former best friend | We were such good friends for years and now we're just not. I shit talked him and treated him poorly - now he's moved on and has friends who actually treat him well. It's all my fault too :(
SAT01	Most shower thoughts aren't thought up in the shower | [removed]
SAT01	I apologized and he forgave me. I hang out with him sometimes still but it's nothing like it was before :(

SAT01	I don't understand. Can someone please fill me in?
SAT01	This is just kinda the way he sings tbh
SAT01	Apparently 1 in 200 men are direct descendants of Genghis Khan - which means that at least a few people reading this have his blood flowing through their veins.
SAT01	My mom says she notices me talking to myself a lot
SAT01	What makes you wish the human race didn't exist? | 
SAT01	Too much going on and I just can't keep up | Anyone?  Feels like there is just too much going on in the world and in life in general, to the point where I just can't keep up anymore. I have OCD so feeling like I have no control or understanding really gets to me.
SAT01	I'm so sorry for your loss. No one should ever have to go through something like that :(
SAT01	I don't feel like I'm wasting my youth - I feel like I'm wasting my life.
SAT01	So many people do this I can't even word it man - it's just that no one talks about it. Fantasizing and daydreaming are pretty commonplace for most people - especially those struggling with depression - to the point where it is listed as an actual condition: Maladaptive Daydreaming. You're not a loser for doing this, and if you are, then so are millions of others - including myself.   Edit: Just look up "daydream" on r/depression - you'll see. Maladaptive Daydreaming even has its own sub too.
SAT01	Good Job man. Use that space for ebooks instead or something.
SAT01	I'm a terrible pet owner | I have the cutest little dog you've ever seen in you're entire life - but I don't treat him well at all. I'm not abusive or anything; I just don't show him as much love as I should. One day he's gonna die and I'm gonna wish I treated him better :(  The worst part is that I was the one who wanted him.
SAT01	I have OCD as well and it's managed to take all the enjoyment out of all of my hobbies - so I understand how you feel man.
SAT01	I'll do this. Thank you.
SAT01	I agree that masturbating is okay for the most part, but Porn in particular can be incredibly addictive if used as a coping mechanism imo - just like drugs and/or alcohol.
SAT01	I've been trying NoFap for the past few weeks, and I'm honestly starting to seriously doubt its validity. The way they talk about it makes it seem like not jacking off will give you superhuman abilities or something - all sounds way too good to be true imo.
SAT01	Anyone else here listen to The Smiths | I'm absolutely obsessed with them. I know that this probably sounds cheesy as absolute hell, but I seriously feel like Morrissey speaks to me on a level that no one else can - not even people in my actual life. "I Know It's Over" is easily my favourite by them, and might actually be my favourite song about depression and loneliness period, if not one of my favourite songs of all time - I cry whenever I hear it. There's also a really good cover by Jeff Buckley if you're interested. I've been dealing with depression and social isolation for a long while now and they never cease to be able to cheer me up. Their songs might not be happy, but they sure are relatable - and feeling like you're not alone is one of the best things you can feel imo.  Anyone else?
SAT01	I cant go on, I'll go on
SAT01	Ya they're good too!
SAT01	It's so common - I mean I feel like more people do it than they would care to admit.
SAT01	Like the optimism!
SAT01	Reminds me of something by Jackson Pollock - which is definitely a compliment :)
SAT01	Same situation man. I'm considering just ending it before school starts back up honestly.
SAT01	Great Movie. Very Kafkaesque. 
SAT01	I feel like people just use this line nowadays to justify being awful people.
SAT01	He seemed to have had - by most accounts - a pretty miserable life. His relationship with his dad being a particularly interesting aspect imo.
SAT01	The Metamorphosis. Especially good if you can relate to it - which isn't really a good thing imo.
SAT01	Close enough
SAT01	Your fantasy should be to be happy - not to be dead.
SAT01	They have a few hits actually
SAT01	They have a few in the UK
SAT01	There is a light that never goes out
SAT01	I'm sorry man :(
SAT01	Eyes
SAT01	Obligatory 
SAT01	The line is actually "I am the son and the heir" not "I am the sun and the air."
SAT01	Go see a doctor
SAT01	That's cool - like not cool but interesting. Well put!
SAT01	I won a chocolate fountain in a raffle one time. Never used it and parents just sold it recently  :(
SAT01	At least you're having sex.... Unlike some people :(

El_Mucho_Danko	I really want to die. Help me. | I am fifteen years old and I think about suicide Every. Single. Fucking. Day  I want to kill myself because I feel like a failure. Ever since I was young everyone says I'm "smart" that I have a lot of potential in everything I do.   I don't feel that way.

I'm always broke, girls don't take interest even though people say I'm a 7/10, I want to kill myself.

girlygurl214	I grew up very sheltered, now I'm suicidal. | I grew up by two parents who never taught me anything, so I had extreme social anxiety. I spoke in whispers growing up to everyone and my family would tell me it was my fault I was like this. It would always take me longer to learn stuff than anyone else my age. In school, I was constantly bullied because I was quiet and sheltered, but they wouldn't bully any of the other quiet kids. Every time I would speak to my parents, they would tell me it was my fault I was quiet, talked to myself, and was bullied. I went to the army (basic training) when I was 19, and completely embarrassed myself by being a lost cause and not knowing what everyone else knew. I even ran down one time and forgot my hat and rifle (if this was war I would've gotten the whole platoon killed). I thought it was adhd like what my parents had told me, but everyone told me it was my parents fault. I came here and started working, and struggled, and was threatened to be fired every job I went to. I also felt like I was excluded. Every time I told my mom, she said "oh well that's because it is minimum wage, college is the only way to stop all this harrassing" when my brother is a software developer and in his first software job with educated people he was also bullied for being sheltered. That has literally become her catchphrase, that I need to go to college. I am starting school for an associates degree in accounting this week, but I don't feel it's gonna do any good like what she says. May look good on a resume, but that's it. I was never in a relationship. I am scared as hell to have kids and they'll turn out like me, because their mother didn't know anything to teach them. People always speak about being abused, neglected, abandoned by their parents, but it makes them nothing like i am, not being independent, being completely lost. I am now 21 and depressed, even considering suicide.
girlygurl214	I wrote this letter to my mom, how does it sound? | Mom, do you really think your life is tiring because you work two jobs when I did the exact same thing?   Do you think your life is tiring because your husband cheated on you?   Were you the one who had a speech impediment and didn't talk to anyone until she was 7, was embarrassed and didn't know what was wrong with her, and was always blamed and told it was her fault by her own parents?   Were you the one who's parents never taught her anything, so she grew up not knowing how to solve the most basic problems?  Were you the one who grew up not being taught any social skills, not knowing how to make any friends, or even how to start conversations?  Were you the one who was bullied consistently in school, and who would not even know how to stand up for herself when people were tormenting her?  Were you the one who would sit alone by herself when people were talking and having conversations with each other?  Were you the one who was not involved in any clubs, activities, or sports?  Were you the one who would act very socially awkward and say the wrong thing wherever she went?  Were you the one when she turned 19, when she was in her first social situation, did not have a clue what to do and did not know what everyone else knew, and literally embarrassed herself??  Were the the one who did not know how to work or get along with anyone when she started working?  Were you the one who was threatened to get fired every job she went to?  Were you the one who has been taken advantage of by mostly everyone she met in her life?  Mom, are you the one who has been sheltered all her life?  Mom, are you the one who has no idea how to start a relationship?  Mom, are you the one who can not be dependent and do anything by herself, not even wake up on time without someone waking her up?  Mom, are you the one who's father has never spoken to her about anything real, just what she ate during the day or how much she makes an hour?  Mom, are you the one so scared to have kids because you're afraid they will turn out the same way, from a mother who knows nothing about what to teach them?  Mom, please don't tell me you're upset because you're in another country then your family, you work two jobs, or your husband had control over you. Every story you tell me when you were younger involves your circle of friends, your parents supporting anything with your friends, and going anywhere she wanted with her friends. People always talk about being abused, neglected, mistreated when they were younger, but the thing is they know what to do. I am the opposite-I feel like I have no parents and on top of that, haven't learned anything these past 21 years I've been alive. Every day I have to deal with these thoughts in my head. I wish you knew how I felt instead of saying "just be more positive" or blaming it all on dad. Every time someone talks about their crappy childhood, I smirk in my head, thinking, "Well, at least that didn't make you a socially awkward animal like I am." I am the only one out of the people I met who are this way.  Mom, stop trying to feel sorry for yourself.
girlygurl214	Why do people think i look younger with makeup? | I'm 20, ppl think im 15 or 16 with makeup on. When i put little or no makeup, ppl think im 23 or 24. its confusing, i thought makeup was supposed to make you look older. Any tips on putting on makeup so i look older?
girlygurl214	Should i switch medications? | [removed]
nordmarrow	I'm so overwhelmed, I don't think I can be alive | I've been dealing with depression that's been ignored since I was a child. I've dealt with wanting to slit my throat for years. I have no one, I'm almost positive no one will ever love me, and certain circumstances strongly limit my choices in life and in the future. I don't feel like I can deal with this anymore. I feel trapped in a box so small I cant even move, it's excruciating. I've had so many close calls with suicide recently, I've had the knife up against my throat and I wanted to do it so badly.   I don't know what to do anymore, I want to kill myself so much. 
nordmarrow	thank you haha 
nordmarrow	I hope your road is smooth :) and thank you very much 
nordmarrow	I was in a group chat and the people in it were discussing trans suicide statistics. This person claimed that none of the suicides were due to bullying, and I politely disagreed and provided my own statistics. They then invited me to a private chat and basically told me to kill myself, because I've had a lot of problems with suicidal thoughts recently, but have fought through them.  TL;DR - I lived, bitch 
nordmarrow	CW suicide mention - was talking about trans suicide statistics | 
nordmarrow	The first thing that came to my mind when I read this was the eggplant emoji lmao. Disappointing about your packer, though, hopefully you can get the color out 
nordmarrow	That's exciting! Wednesday is almost here haha. And thank you for the nice wish :) 
nordmarrow	That's wonderful! Congrats on all the success :) 
nordmarrow	I'm sorry to hear that, man :( I hope everything improves for you very soon!
nordmarrow	Coworkers can be great haha
nordmarrow	Are you happy? | I'm really not doing so well right now. I would love to hear some success stories. 
nordmarrow	Whoa, nice! 
nordmarrow	That sounds amazing, I'm glad you're there!
nordmarrow	This is really encouraging to hear about actually, that despite all the hell going on, things are still ok. I'm glad you're at that point :) 
nordmarrow	Congrats on the top surgery and future name change! I'm glad things are looking up for you, that's really nice to hear 
nordmarrow	The love of an animal is the purest thing, haha. I hope everything works out for you, I'm sorry you have to deal with the possibility of your family reacting badly :( 
nordmarrow	That's awesome, I'm glad life is improving :)
nordmarrow	Thank you for the encouragement, I really appreciate it 
nordmarrow	That's a really nice view of things, I'm glad you're happy! 
nordmarrow	20 miles is great! Congrats! 
nordmarrow	Haha you go man, that's really great to hear. I'm sure everything will work out great for you
nordmarrow	This does make me very happy, I'm very glad that you're making this progress :) thank you for sharing
nordmarrow	That sounds great! Best of luck to you :)
nordmarrow	Good luck on your date, and with college! I would definitely consider yours a success story, I wish the best of luck to you :) 
nordmarrow	That's amazing!! I'm super happy for you, thank you for sharing 
nordmarrow	This is so nice to hear, I'm glad that such a small task is such a bright part of your day! Thank you for sharing this 
nordmarrow	What a victory! Those moments are great 
nordmarrow	- When my short friends complain about how tall I am (I'm not tall, they're just very short lol) - When I find myself rubbing my neck/jaw area when I'm worried/thinking  - Being gross, a la eating food off the floor, burping freely when no one's around, etc - Having very short nails  - Wood carving - Surprisingly, wearing necklaces. Like the ones made from a black chain or a simple cord  - Working  - Listening to metal or rap music  - Talking about history with my dad   I know a few of these are based on very strict/old-timey gender roles, but they still make me feel a lot more manly and better about myself and they're not hurting anybody in the process so I'll take it! 
nordmarrow	What are some important things/resources to give to a therapist regarding transgender people? | Hi, I'm a transman who is seeing a therapist, and she is very accepting and kind but doesn't seem to have a lot of experience with trans patients and is fairly in the dark about the subject. I've offered to help her with research and give her some resources/information, but I don't really know where to start.   What would be some good topics to inform her about? Additionally, what would be some good resources for her if she wanted to maybe get the information herself? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, this is appearing to be a much bigger project and wider than I initially thought, since it's all so normal to me!  
nordmarrow	How long did it take your friends to use the right name/pronouns? | I was just wondering about other guys' experiences with close friends. When you came out to them, how long did it take them to use the right name/pronouns for you, if they were accepting? 
nordmarrow	Thanks for the encouragement, and congrats on working things out! 
nordmarrow	Thank you! 
nordmarrow	Bringing in an article sounds like a very good idea, thank you for sharing. It's always comforting to hear success stories, I'm glad things worked out well for you! 
nordmarrow	Any advice for coming out to a therapist? | I recently started seeing a therapist, and she's very nice and seems very open, but I'm not completely sure about where she stands on trans topics. I really want to come out to her next week so that she can help me through figuring out if/how/when I tell my friends and family, because I don't think I could do it on my own without some form of guidance, but I'm very, very nervous. If anyone has any advice at all for this, I would be very grateful!     
nordmarrow	Any experiences with school counselors? | Not being out to anyone is starting to wear on me, plus it's getting to the point where I really need to get myself a binder. I'm currently a Junior, and while I live in a very liberal area, the counselor has been less than helpful in years past, so I'm hesitant to go.  Has anyone gone to the school counselor for trans-related issues? If you have, what was your experience?    (about the binder thing; I read somewhere that it could be a possibility to talk to your counselor and they could help you out with getting a binder if you can't have it shipped to your house. That honestly doesn't sound like a real thing to me, but I suppose it's worth looking into unless someone can say with certainty that it's impossible) 
nordmarrow	I almost never have periods, and it's great, (though a bit worrying) so I feel ya. For advice, I would of course recommend talking to your doctor about your concerns, knowing some of the warning signs of a period starting, etc. But also: Just from my personal experience, I think you should be very cautious about taking birth control, because it's often given to people with irregular periods. I started taking it (as was my doctor's instruction) and it severely and very negatively impacted my mental health. I spoke to my doctor about it, and all she did was prescribe even stronger ones (because they had not been successful in bringing my period back) and the anxiety and depression just got worse. I stopped taking the pills because I couldn't deal with it anymore and now I'm more or less fine. So, yeah, if you do end up going on birth control please please just be on the lookout for these effects so that you can stop them as soon as possible. From what I've seen, they don't really tell you about them, though many people have all had the same experience.   Good luck! 
nordmarrow	How can I ask for a masculine haircut without actually asking for one? | I'm sorry I can't go into much more detail, but long story short I am very in the closet and desperately need a way to ask for a masculine haircut without directly ASKING for one (even though I tried that, and was given a short-feminine haircut anyway because what I had wanted wouldn't "look good," but that's another issue)  I always see such kind, supportive, and helpful people in this community so I figured I could try asking you guys. Any advice would be much appreciated!   
nordmarrow	I feel like confidence is a big part of this. I'm very shy and quiet so I often get people who think they can/should be making decisions for me, haha. Good for you for going with the kind of hair you like, and thank you for the encouragement! 
marlymarly	Thanks to my medication, I am finally doing really well | There seems to be a lack of success stories here, so I thought I would share mine.  I've had depression for a decade now. It has ranged from moderate to severe, and I was low functioning. Around four years ago, I finally got help from a psychiatrist and psychologist.   Therapy fixed a lot of my problems, especially the social aspect. However, my mood remained unstable despite being on medication. Last year it got so bad that I had to be hospitalized.  After going through five therapists, four psychiatrists, and countless medications, I have finally found my personal mix!  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my body. I feel emotions again, and even more importantly, I feel motivated again. I got a job lined up, a clean house, I'm reconnecting with my friends, and a new boyfriend.  My medication:  * Viibryd 40mg (SSRI) * Vraylar 1.5mg (Atypical antipsychotic) * Gabapentin 300mg (For sleep/mood) * Klonopin .25-.5mg (As needed for anxiety) * Adderall 30mg XR (For energy/possible ADHD)
marlymarly	Thank you. I wish you the best of luck with whatever brought you to r/depression.
marlymarly	Yup. Without my insurance I'd be spending around $2,000 a month on medication. For comparison, that's x3 my rent. 
marlymarly	So do you! 
marlymarly	Good luck! My best advice is to find a psych who takes you seriously. 
marlymarly	I still struggle to afford my meds as my SSRI and adjunctive (vraylar) are name brand. But yes, I am extremely lucky, both in comparison to other countries and my own. Where do you live, if you don't mind me asking? 
marlymarly	Thank you and you too! 
marlymarly	Thank you. I have only been stable for three months now, so relapse is something I do worry about. Best of luck to you. 
marlymarly	Yep I'm still on it. It took almost four years of trying different medication before my doctor put me on it and diagnosed me with ADHD. It's not scary at all. She started with a low dose (I have anxiety) and we worked our way up to 30mg xr. My anxiety is actually better now and I have only a few mild side effects. 
marlymarly	I got accommodations in college. You'll need a note from your doctor stating your medical condition, accommodations you want, and why these accommodations will help you. Then you'd give the letter to the disability resource center and they'll approve/deny your accommodations. It's generally pretty easy to get accommodations in my experience. I applied for almost all of the ones my college offered and then used them as needed. Better to have the option and not need it than need the accommodation and not have it, you know?  Common accommodations for ADHD:  * Note taker (free of charge) * 1.5x time on tests * low distraction environment for tests 
marlymarly	I recently took a pre-employment drug test. I'm on Adderall and Klonopin (and a bunch of other drugs). I called the drug testing company before I took the test. They said that they kept medication confidential. I'm pretty sure your medication is covered under HIPPA.
marlymarly	I'm a pharmacy technician. By law, the active ingredients and release mechanism of medication have to be the same between manufacturers. You're most likely just suffering from a placebo effect.  Edit: If you're really concerned, you can request a specific manufacturer. Just know that it'll take a few days for your pharmacy to get the meds and your pharmacy staff will talk about you behind your back lol
marlymarly	It sounds like you need to see an experienced psychiatrist who is open to medication other than antidepressants. Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and stimulants are good options. Unfortunately, it will be hard to find the right medication, but I hope that trying something totally different will give you a glimmer of hope. I believe you are a candidate for TMS/ECT at this point as well. I would talk to your doctor about if it.   
marlymarly	This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but as someone who has fought their depression tooth and nail for the past decade, I don't have a lot of sympathy for depressed people who don't want to get better (key word want-- I have nothing against people who can't afford help)  It isn't her fault she's depressed; it's an illness no less real than depression. However, she still has the choice to take small steps towards getting better. Therapy is a good start. Just from my experience, it is impossible to have a healthy and happy relationship with a depressed person who wants to stay depressed. Perhaps you just have to be there for her until she decides to get better.
marlymarly	It really depends on the medication. Wellbutrin is generally a good option for sluggishness and brain fog. In my case (which is a lot like yours), I still had symptoms even after my mood stabilized. My doctor then added adderall and it was a godsend. My brain fog is cured now. 
marlymarly	IME supplements are worth nothing when it comes to serious brain fog. Are you on medication? 
marlymarly	Sexual side effects tend to stick around, but not always. You might find relief with adding something like Wellbutrin to your meds. Talk to your doctor about it. 
marlymarly	Sounds like you need to stop talking to feminist extremists. 
marlymarly	I'm extremely likely to need medication for the rest of my life. Some people need glasses to see the work clearly. Others need antidepressants. There's no shame in that. 
marlymarly	Masculinity is not all toxic. Toxic masculinity refers to things like "real men don't show their feelings" and "men always want sex so can't be raped" and so on. The idea is that these things hurt men in the long run. 
marlymarly	I think it's really awesome that you can recognize that you need help. Inpatient isn't nearly as bad as TV presents it. Just bring lots of books and you'll be fine.
marlymarly	The first session is mostly the therapist getting to know you. They generally ask questions like "what brings you here" and "what do you want to get out of therapy."   One thing that took me forever to realize is that you're allowed to tell your therapist that you don't want to talk about specific things. They'll respect that.
marlymarly	Yeah, my mental illnesses do that. I become a shell of the person I used to be. The only medication that helped me was Adderall, but it took forever and countless medications before my doctors would even consider it.   You might want to look into PTSD/CPTSD. I'm diagnosed with both. Both can also cause you to feel detached from others and reality. It's also extremely common for abuse survivors to have big gaps in their memory. There are years that I have no memories of.
marlymarly	First off, there's nothing wrong with needing medication. Some people need glasses to see the world clearly. Your medication is basically glasses for your brain :)  I'm a pharm tech. Honestly, 95% of people who blame the manufacturer for problems are just suffering from placebo effect. By law, a medication has to have the same active ingredient and release mechanism no matter who makes it. That being said, there is a small percent of people who have problems with the filler ingredients. You could try using the name brand Luvox. If it's too expensive, see if manufacturer offers copay cards online. Copay cards will generally cover around $100 of your copay.   Maybe I missed it in your post, but I'm not sure why your doc took you off Luvox in the first place.   If I were you, I'd see a psychiatrist and get started on Luvox again. Track your mood very carefully. If your mood starts to fall into depression, RUN to your psychiatrist and ask for a higher dose of Luvox or an adjunctive. These are used to make antidepressants work better. Generally, your doctor will prescribe a low dose of a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic to boost your mood.   I had problems with my antidepressant not working when things got bad. It's very common! I'm having great success with an antipsychotic added to my meds. 
marlymarly	I'm guessing you've tried therapy, but have you tried long term therapy (9+ mo of weekly visits) with a therapist who you felt comfortable with? 
marlymarly	Sounds like you're below a solid 6.
marlymarly	I took Rexulti for two months. My psychiatrist said it works really fast, which is great. I went from rock bottom to okay within two weeks. It made my head a little fuzzy and made me slightly twitchy. Despite this, the pros certainly outweighed the cons. Unfortunately, I was one of the unlucky few who still gained weight on Rexulti, so my psych had to switch me to Vraylar. Vraylar took forever to work, but has been extremely good for me. Weight LOSS, clearer head (it's supposed to help you regain some mental functioning) and lots of energy. 
marlymarly	I wouldn't recommend it. Their eyes respitory systems are sensitive. 
marlymarly	Yay! I'm so glad to hear that. 
marlymarly	This is really good advice, OP. I'd like to add is that medication can make you feel pretty weird the first month you're on it. If the side effects are nothing unbearable, it's best to wait at least a month so that the medication has time to fully work. 
marlymarly	Alcohol prevents your meds from being absorbed properly. I notice that I feel horrible after drinking multiple nights in a row. 
marlymarly	Many antidepressants are known to cause brain fog. So I'd say it's pretty normal. I'd talk to your doctor about it. You may need to switch medications or take medicine for adhd. I take both antidepressants and adderall; the combo works well for me. 
marlymarly	I don't really have any advice since I'm having the same exact issues. I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. It's really hard to learn how to find healthy people when you're not used to it.
marlymarly	Yes, take it every day. Before bed is best. If you have any health problems, make sure you talk to your doctor before starting it. 
marlymarly	I would talk to your doctor about it. Depending on the severity of your acne, the pros may out weigh the cons. 
marlymarly	I'm on Vraylar, an atypical antipsychotic. I can only speak for myself, but it has been fantastic for energy and motivation. It is extremely activating; I would say it's comparable to my Adderall in that aspect. The downside is that it is extremely expensive without good insurance (w/ good insurance and the copay card I pay $15/month). It's brand new, so it may not be available in your country. 
marlymarly	Antidepressants work well for a lot of people, but not everyone. The chances of your depression going into remission increase significantly when you combine therapy and antidepressants. You can get them from your GP. They're not too hard to get. Most people have to try a couple of different meds before they find the right fit.  Personally, my medication saves my life every day. My depression is pretty severe, so I have to take an antipsychotic in addition to my antidepressants. It was scary at first, but so so so worth it. I still have the occasional "bad day", but being able to enjoy life 90% of the time is a real gift. If you have the money, go for it.
marlymarly	You're welcome! Hope it works for you! 
marlymarly	So to start, use wood bedding in their cage. I use a glass baking dish as a potty. It's best to start on a weekend so you can monitor them closely. Check as frequently as possible for wet bedding. Whenever you find some, put it in their potty. Keep doing this for a few days, and your chin will learn that pee goes in the potty!   Once they're using their potty on their own, you can switch to fleece bedding in their cage and wood bedding in their potty, which (IMO) is cleaner.   Hope that made sense! I'm not the best at explaining things.  
marlymarly	A dust bath once a week shouldn't be causing flakiness. You can try feeding him Oxbow's Skin and Coat supplement to see if it goes away. If it doesn't, I would bring him to the vet.
marlymarly	* They poop like crazy! If you plan on using fleece as bedding, buy a small handheld vacuum. They're like $15-$20. It will be your best friend.  * They can also be trained to pee in a (non-plastic) litter box. Their pee is the only thing that really smells, so if you want to control odor, pee training is great.   * They have very sensitive digestive systems. They shouldn't be fed any veggies, fruits, or nuts. Most pet store treats are not healthy for them.  * They will eat plastic if given the chance, which can cause internal damage. Only use wood in their cage.  * They're extremely sensitive to heat. Keep their cage at 72 degrees or below. 
marlymarly	I'm a junior in college, but I decided to take a year off from school and work instead. I think it is helping me a lot. I had breakdowns the past two semesters, one of which resulted in a hospitalization. If you do take a break, I think it's important to stay busy and socially connected. Being away from school can lead to a slippery slope of isolation, you know?
marlymarly	Hey there. What's going on?
marlymarly	I'm sorry to hear that. Your situation must be really difficult. I've had depression for about a decade, and it can get really tiring fighting so long. Do you want to talk about the mess you're in? 
marlymarly	I've been suffering from depression since middle school too; my parents never noticed how much I was suffering. It really hurts when people that are supposed to care for us end up disappointing us. It sounds like you're in a really painful situation. What's your relationship like with your extended family?
marlymarly	I hear you. I know of a number of people who had similar experiences with medication.   Something that helps me when I feel too tired/lethargic to do anything is just choose one small thing to do that day. I like to remember that I'm sick, not lazy. Have you thought about doing something similar? 
marlymarly	You sound really overwhelmed. I can't imagine how awful that must be.   Yeah, there have been times I've lost the "fight" in me as well. I recently tried a new medication for depression. While I was waiting for it to work, I basically told myself that if it didn't, then I would be done. Luckily it started working after a while.  What was the most recent thing that went wrong?
marlymarly	These all sound like really painful methods. It's only logical to be scared. Why do you feel like you need a way out?
marlymarly	Your family and friends sound really unsupportive. That's rough. Everyone has to start somewhere! It's great that your new boss wants to let you try to be a hostess. They must have really liked you. 
marlymarly	I took Wellbutrin 150 and 300mg XL for about a year.  I would take it in the mornings, as that's how my doctor prescribed it. It helped with my energy a little and did make me feel a bit better. It also made me almost too horny. 
marlymarly	This. is. abuse! He sounds like the fucked up one, not you. Screw him. Sounds like you dodged a bullet IMO. I wish people like that could feel the pain they inflict on others, although there's nothing we can really do about it.  If it helps, people like this are always going to find something to "wrong" about the person they're dating. Honestly, even if you weren't depressed, he'd still find something because he needs that "something" to feel better about himself.
marlymarly	Whoot whoot!! 
marlymarly	Where did you get that copay card? The sign up online says that they'll cover anything above *$30*, but I could be reading it wrong.
marlymarly	If you trust and like your therapist, then the 3rd option sounds like the healthiest. If it scares you too much to admit the codependency, perhaps start seeing a new therapist and work on your codependent problems there?  Either way, I just want to say that it takes a lot of strength to admit to codependency. You should feel proud of yourself.  
marlymarly	Personally, if you can afford it, I would see a testing psychologist and have them test you for learning disorders, mental illness, and ADHD. They're more likely to catch some of the sneakier disorders than just talking with a psychiatrist. 
marlymarly	My mother has depression with episodes of psychosis, although IMO I think she may be bipolar. She had multiple periods where she would go off her medication and start acting hyper and paranoid. She thought people were out to get her. When I was 13, she grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to cut-off all her hair because she thought it was full of bugs.  My father was never formally diagnosed, but I've come to the conclusion that he suffered from some sort of personality disorder. He was very cruel to everyone in the family, but especially me. He'd call me names, cut me down, and basically destroyed my self-esteem. He was truly emotionally abusive.  When I left for college, I sought therapy. I can tell you that therapists take emotional abuse as seriously as if your parents beat you or molested you. Therapy really helped with the social anxiety and destructive thought patterns I suffered from growing up in an abusive home.
marlymarly	I was diagnosed with ADHD at 18, then undiagnosed at 19, then re-diagnosed with ADHD at 21. IME different doctors have different views on how ADHD "should" present. There are lots of conditions that mimic ADHD symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue. I find it strange that your doctor didn't diagnose you with some sort of disorder when you're clearly having problems with being functional. I would get a second opinion. It might not be ADHD, but it does sound like *something*. 
marlymarly	So I have PTSD, GAD, and ADHD in addition to my depression. However, depression is my main problem. My experience may be different than yours since medication works differently for everyone.  Overall, antidepressants have been pretty hit or miss with me. I started off with Prozac, which helped my anxiety but made me very tired and foggy. My doctor added Wellbutrin, which boosted my mood a little but made my anxiety a little worse. When my sleepiness didn't improve, I was switched to Viibryd. Viibryd worked great for a while, although it didn't help my anxiety as much as Prozac. Since I still was having problems with focus, I was diagnosed with ADHD and given Adderall, which ironically improved my anxiety. Then I was raped in college, which eventually lead to a mental break down and was hospitalized. In the hospital, I was given Effexor (SNRI) which didn't help at all. Since Effexor didn't work, I was given an fast-acting atypical antipsychotic (used to make antidepressants work better) which was amazing. I went from rock bottom to stable within a month (Rexulti). Unfortunately, I also gained 20 pounds and had to be switched to a different antipsychotic (Vraylar). This is the one I am currently on.   So currently I'm on Viibryd (SSRI), Vraylar (Atypical antipsychotic), Adderall, Gabapentin (for sleep/mood), and Klonopin (benzo).   While this mix is a bit more expensive than I'd like, it works very well for me. I still have break-through depression about 20% of the time, but it is mild. My motivation increased greatly after adding Vraylar. Vraylar decreased my appetite, which is great as I'm trying to lose weight. I experience no side effects from Viibryd. 
marlymarly	Thank you! The biggest thing I did was identifying my values and working towards them in small, but concrete ways. It's the basis of the type of therapy I was in (ACT). 
marlymarly	It's generally not recommended to stop antidepressants until you have been asymptomatic for at least a year. You really shouldn't stop your medication without talking to your doctor first. When I came off of Effexor, my withdrawals lasted two weeks, so just something to keep in mind.
marlymarly	Gabapentin helped me when coming off of effexor. It's also used for withdrawals from narcotics iirc.   Another option I've heard of is to switch to a SSRI that has milder withdrawal, and then wean yourself off of that.   I'm so sorry you're going through this. Your last doctor sounds terrible! 
marlymarly	Yes, in fact, it is one of the "warning signs" I look out for as (for me) it means my depression is getting worse.  I don't know why, but hugging a heating pad actually relieves this symptom for me. 
marlymarly	Unfortunately, that's pretty much all a doctor is capable of. Doctors aren't trained much when it comes to mental health, even psychiatrists. Perhaps she was overwhelmed or felt out of her depth? Next time I would just stick to your symptoms and not pour your heart out. That's all doctors are really good for, anyway.   Have you thought about seeing a therapist as well?  Edit: grammar
marlymarly	How do you know that it's not that your brain chemistry is making it hard for you to connect to other people?
marlymarly	Usually, side effects appear pretty quickly. I've never had sexual side effects from SSRIs. Maybe you're just one of us lucky ones.
marlymarly	I can't name a specific book, but I would look for something related to DBT. DBT is fantastic for people who are looking to better control things like lashing out, but it's great for depression as well. 
marlymarly	Did your pharm tech tell you why it wasn't approved? You might need to get prior approval, which basically means your doctor needs to call the insurance company and tell them why they're prescribing it.   I was taken off rexulti about three months ago. I was on it for two months at 1mg (iirc). I had mood swings for about two weeks. It wasn't fun, but it wasn't nearly as bad as going off venlafaxine. 
marlymarly	I would just say that you had some health issues that prevented you from working. Short and sweet. 
marlymarly	I was turned away by my college's free therapy services for being too sick. This wasn't a small college either; it was a huge state college.   Even with the great insurance, my therapy + medication costs me more per month than I spend on food. That's a lot when you're in college. Despite all that, I'm one of the fortunate ones. My heart goes out to every person who is not as lucky as I am. It pisses me off.   Edit: spelling 
marlymarly	My copay is only $25, so it's not therapy eating up my money. It's the medication. I'm on name brand drugs. 
marlymarly	I love the babadook. It Follows is great too. At first look it's about STDs, but I found it very relatable to my PTSD. 
marlymarly	Honestly, it sounds like you've been ghosted. I'm so sorry. 
marlymarly	This happens to me all the time. 
marlymarly	Is asking your parents for financial help an option?   If you can't find a therapist, perhaps try going to your local health clinic? They might be able to get you started on medication. Generic older SSRIs are very cheap. Prozac is under $5/month at walmart. Assuming your depression is preventing you from working, it might be enough to get you a part time job. 
marlymarly	I'm so glad it helped you. I faced losing my pets some months ago and I was an absolute mess. I feel you. Let me know how confronting your landlord goes? 
marlymarly	Yeah, sleepiness is a common side effect of antidepressants. Some are more sedative than others. I would talk to your doctor. They might add something stimulating like Wellbutrin to your meds. Adderall, though, is really hard to get for depression. 
marlymarly	I went through childhood trauma as well. I can really relate to putting off important shit because of anxiety/PTSD. I've put off getting my dishwasher fixed for months because having people I don't know in my apartment triggers my PTSD like crazy.   It's obvious from your post that you really care about your pets. I'm glad they help you. You're not the worst person to these kitties; you gave them a home and love when they were without both. Plus, a bad person would have just ignored the rescue's suggestion of adopting a pair.  What helps me when I'm anxious is to prepare for the worst outcome. Luckily, the law is on your side.   * [This](https://www.animallaw.info/article/summary-emotional-support-animal-cases) web page lists a bunch of law cases showing that your cats are protected under the Fair Housing Agreement. I would print it out to bring to your landlord if they give you problems.   * [This](https://www.certapet.com/emotional-support-animal-rights-legal-perspective/) page is good for reading about your rights  * [Here](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo/fhhubs) are the people you should call for advice
marlymarly	Posting here as I'm open to other people adding me as well.   Snapchat: mrmozzly 
marlymarly	Therapy is a lot more than just talking about your problems. Therapists help you retrain your thought patterns and challenge distorted perceptions. I find therapy helpful because my therapist holds me accountable for actually doing things that will help. If you don't have much of a support network, having someone that believes and supports you is a huge help (at least for me).  It can be hard to find the right therapist, though. I went through about three before I found one that clicks.
marlymarly	Medication was the only thing that really worked for me.
marlymarly	I'll talk to you
marlymarly	Yeah, I've been avoiding ketamine because I already have issues with derealization. I've gone through a number of useless medications as well; it's incredibly frustrating.   Viibryd is a SSRI that is known for having no side effects (incl. sexual) for most people. I take it because every other SSRI I've tried made me spacy and sleep way too much. Just throwing that out there.
marlymarly	Have you considered medication? It's not instant, but it's generally faster than therapy. 
marlymarly	Magnesium did absolutely nothing for me except make me poop.   If you're looking for cheap and safe supplements for anxiety, l-theanine is lovely. 
marlymarly	Best of luck! 
marlymarly	Therapy is a great start, especially when you are/were dealing with toxic people. It took about a year and a half, but I reinvented myself socially with therapy. I'm much more independent and outgoing, now. 
marlymarly	That's awesome! Your mindset on hobbies is really healthy. 
marlymarly	Whoot whoot! Finding the right medication can be hard, but it's worth it (at least for me.) 
marlymarly	I've always bonded much more deeply with people who had a hard time growing up or who have mental illness. 
marlymarly	He sounds like he needs to be evaluated by a professional. Some of the things you describe could be due to depression and/or anxiety, both of which are really common in adults with ADHD. 
marlymarly	I hear you. Hope you're managing at work today. 
marlymarly	Is it possible you're experiencing panic attacks? Either way, I've had similar experiences and words can't describe how awful they feel. I feel like the anticipation can be the worst part. Sending hugs your way.   I don't know if it'll help you, but for some reason hugging a heating pad to my chest helps when I feel like this. 
marlymarly	That's really difficult and frustrating. I'm sorry. I think the best advice I can give at this point is to take care of yourself, OP. 
marlymarly	What does he think is causing the shifts in his mood/functioning?
marlymarly	Sounds like you need a boost to be able to make positive changes in your life. Just from my experience, antidepressants help me when I'm stuck like that.   I'd start out by visiting your gp. Tell them how you're feeling and that you tried therapy. They might want to run some blood tests first to make sure there's not an underlying health problem causing you to feel this way. They'll then probably put you on the lowest dose of a SSRI. It can take a few tries to find the right dose and medication.   If you're open to trying a different therapist, I would do that as well. It's hard work finding the right one. I went through about three before I found one that I clicked with. Therapy, along with medication, has really helped me manage my depression. Remember that the normal course of talk therapy for "uncomplicated" depression is 9 mo. Of weekly appts. Since you have had depression since you were quite young, it'll probably take longer. Therapy works very slowly. 
marlymarly	Have you thought about going to therapy yourself? I've always found that the best therapists are the ones who have been the patient before. 
marlymarly	I get that feeling a lot as well. (Stolen from a reddit post here a while back) "It doesn't matter if you want to kill yourself, you still got to deal with living."  
marlymarly	It's amazing how kind and supportive people are! I'm a shy person (PTSD), but you're right, it's so easy to make friends.  The one thing I'll remember from my stay was this time at group therapy. I finally confronted my father for his past sexual abuse and shared it in group after the therapist gave me a nudge. Literally, five people came up to me afterward and told me how much it meant to them that another survivor spoke up. 
marlymarly	Same. I wish there wasn't such an awful stigma around in-patient. I feel like so many people would benefit from it, but are scared to speak up because of the misconceptions society has around "mental wards."
marlymarly	If you would have asked me that before I tried medication, I would have said yes. In reality, I've learned that I'm naturally an up beat and friendly person, but my depression takes that away from me. But who I am depressed =/= who I am as a person.  My fix was medication and long term therapy. 
sataned	Dealing with munchies | Any r/trees ents here??? How do y'all deal with the munchies? I binged so fucking hard last night because I was high. I was literally shoving cheetos in my mouth till it was dry af and I couldn't breath. I also ate a whole sleeve of Oreos and a bunch of other crap that I regret 😩
sataned	I'm done. | Tomorrow's my birthday and i'm gonna kill myself I can't take this any longer 
sataned	I just realized i'll never ever like myself | Why keep on living. Life is painful it's not worth it to live with something I despise  
sataned	I feel the same too but when you drink or eat food you get a lil bloated. I especially feel this way if I binge. After I binge, I feel like my collarbones have disappeared and I gain a double chin??? It's so weird but I feel like I magically gain 50 pounds 
sataned	Yessss a lot of the times I take naps after school to avoid eating and save calories for dinner 
sataned	oh fuck
sataned	I feel like I walk weird like my body sways side to side if that makes sense?? 
sataned	One of my teachers is catching on | [removed]
sataned	i'm lonely 
sataned	Ayyy<333 
sataned	This is exactly me, my birthday is in a couple days and my parents are the only ones who made plans. My so called "friends" wont even bother to text me. 
sataned	Thank you it means a lot 😊❤️ 
sataned	😭💞 
sataned	Mental illness 
sataned	Crack is one helluva drug 
sataned	Fuck everything | My life's the biggest fucking joke i'm surprised i've haven't ended it yet.
sataned	I practically lived on Coke Zero but now if I have a couple of Coke Zero Sugars I start to feel nauseous??? 
sataned	Really...? Right in front of my salad?? 
sataned	I love that yellow speckled background! I got a new Baker deck awhile ago but now I wish I got that one 😂 
sataned	Too real | 
sataned	SQUIGGLE BROW??? MORE LIKE REVERSE BROW 😝💖 GET ON MY LEVEL SWEATY 💅🏻👅 | 
sataned	~art~ comforts the disturbed, and disturbs the comfortable 
sataned	HELP!!! Is this too much kratom??? This is my first time doing kratom so I have backup benzos just in case I start tripping | 
sataned	I like it sharp so I cut my ex boyfies!!! 😈😈😈

sataned	Holy fuck I live for the lil bump above elbows 
sataned	issa s c a m 
sataned	After an AVB edible I always ptfo and sleep for +12 hours lol
sataned	I haven't really tried many e.l.f products other than a couple of their brushes which are nice and cheap. But a really inexpensive brand that I love is Essence! I've tried most of their stuff and I love it! Especially the lipsticks which are my favorite lipsticks ever and they are under $3 each! You can find the brand at Ulta! 
sataned	I would splurge on the ABH Dipbrow because you only need a tiny bit so it'll last awhile. Also I love the Dipbrow because my brows will actually stay on throughout the school day lol. If your trying not to spend a lot then just buy an ELF flat angled brush to apply it, it's what I use and it works perfectly 
sataned	Oh just wait at the 6 hour mark it'll really hit you hard 
sataned	Just Diet Coke but if I need actual food in my stomach then watermelon or a quest bar 
sataned	How do people seriously have no appetite when they have depression??? | I literally just wanna eat everything because it seems like that's my only source of happiness. But after I eat I feel guilty and then i'm sad again lol 🤷🏼‍♀️ 
sataned	It boggles my mind that people could drink Venti frappuccinos that have +500 calories like it's nothing!!! 
sataned	The only time I get outta bed is to get food 😂 
sataned	YASSSSSS GURL 👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖 u slaying that eye look 💅🏻👀 and the coast 🌊⚡️😝
sataned	I feel
sataned	I have a recipe for them but I just buy mini frozen green beans 
sataned	This is me rn! I just ate a bunch of pizza tonight after restricting heavily after one week. But it's okay it happens to all of us. I just tell myself that tomorrow's a new day and to learn from my mistakes/what triggered the binge. Also a tip I learned for night binging: stop at 12am. The day is over and so is the binging (I just think of my calories resetting at 12). Hang in there girly it's okay don't beat yourself up! 
sataned	Mini asian green beans! I can have 2 cups for around 80 calories and it tastes like that greasy, msg-ridden Chinese food is that we all love lol. Definitely helps with cravings and I can binge on a whole bag and not feel so guilty. 
sataned	Thank you! I have Osteoporosis so i'm very prone to broken bones but I have been wanting to skate for years. I'll definitely look into getting some protective gear. 
sataned	Biggest injury was  probs when I fell on my arm and broke it, had to have a huge arm cast. 
sataned	I'm definitely gonna start wearing protective gear when I'm all healed. It's not worth having to be in a cast for 6 weeks and in constant pain. 
sataned	Not that hard. Was first getting use to the board and standing on it/giving it a lil push but I slipped and fell
sataned	Same!! I've really been noticing my cellulite lately it's bad. I wish i could workout but my wrist is broken so I feel so lost rn
Kim_Dom	Got asked questions about my suicidal tendancies by a new clinic and its made me uncomfortable. | Going through some huge changes at the minute including moving out my parents house. I signed up for a new mental health counsellor then got an urgant call back in response to the severity of my desire to kill myself. Ive been pretfy good recently and i think when i move out my life will start picking up again but just saying out loud my thoughts on killing myself and being reminded how uncommon(?) & intense those thoughts are. I do find some days unbearable but im doing my best to love myself and not be full of self hatred. 
endthrowaway55	How long am I supposed to believe it gets better? | This is an expanded repost of something I posted in the dead of night yesterday that I'm pretty sure no one read.   I'm 22. My life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew. I can't remember most of my childhood because I was raped my a priest when I was in fourth grade. I can't really remember much of anything about my life. Even shit that happened fairly recently. I can't maintain normal relationships. First one ended in me being stalked for five years. Second one was just me being used. Third/fourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth (no, it hasn't come back a year and a half later), and seriously contemplating death. This is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety. And then I got kicked out on short notice.  Fifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together. After two months of not talking I started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing. I kind of hate myself for it, but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because it's really hard for me to meet and approach new people. My only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority. These people also think I'm a fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me. I don't really blame them.  I got bullied a lot k-12. I understand why. I'm generally strange and aggravating to be around. I've worked on it a lot, so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours. After high school I took a gap year in Germany. That was a mistake. I was pretty lonely and just drank a lot. And then I started blacking out (turns out PTSD from being raped as a child can cause that), and my family basically told me I was on my own and that they didn't want to deal with me coming back at the moment (at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought I was having seizures).  College sucked. I chose poorly and wasn't ready. I did a year. I'm still on leave. I know I'll never be able to afford to go back. I'm not sure that I want to. Up until Thursday I didn't think I would have to. Because this summer, after all of the bullshit, the shit jobs, the loneliness, and everything else, I managed to actually get the job I really wanted. And then I went and somehow found a way to fuck it up. Actually no, that's a lie. I know exactly how I fucked it up. By being myself.  I'm not sure what's left at this point. My entire life has been about making it to the next place because that won't suck, right? Only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard I try. I don't have dreams for the future anymore. When people ask me where I seem myself in ten years I'm completely lost because I can't imagine even being alive in ten years. It's not that I plan on being dead, it's that I don't see how I'm going to make it. I'm just tired. I want to stop. I've been pushing for what feels like my entire life now, and I just want a break. My earliest memories are of someone stomping on my fingers on the playground while I'm trying to draw something on a piece of paper. I don't want this anymore. I have plans to keep going. I've already sent out a bunch of job applications, and am getting my documentation together for something else that may workout for me. It just hard to even draw up the energy to keep going. I feel like I'm never going to be able to sit back and relax for more than a week and enjoy the feeling that life is actually pretty okay. Because every time I finally start to get that feeling every comes crashing down like a house of cards made out of bricks.  I've really tried to improve myself and unfuck my life. And to a certain extent I've succeeded. It's just not enough. I'm not sure it will ever be enough.

That_Awesomeguy	[RANT] Been ghosted by a girl, feel like I'm back to stage one | So I've had depression for a long time, however, i've always tried my best to not let it control my entire life. Relationships and work are hard on some days but I try to push through with this image of being okay. I had a girlfriend for a while (about a year and a half roughly) I was living away from my parents, I had a good job and I was fit and had a girl that I loved very much. For those few months, I felt normal in a way? To cut the long story short, this girl that I loved very much cheated on me on two separate occasions with two different guys. The only way I had found out was looking through her messages one morning while she left for work, seeing her talk to this guy and arranging sex with him behind my back honestly tore me apart. It changed me forever and I feel like even today it's still affecting me (it's been almost 7 months since we broke up). I don't often talk about how much it affected me and my view on the world. I think more than anything it made me a bitter person, I hate that I was innocent and had that experience. I understand there are worse things in the world but man..it just fucked me up.   Anyway, I was in a dark place for a long time, I eventually pulled myself out of the darkness of my room and began going to the gym regularly and began getting myself back on the right path. I stopped drinking, I started going to bed on time and started looking for a job etc Come August I felt like I was finally ready to get back out there and date again. I had a couple dates and mostly they never became anything but it was a mutual thing and we just moved onwards. I even made a few friends which were nice, I had spoken to this recent girl for a while and she asked me on a date a few days ago. I was excited and I was feeling good, the date went really well I thought and we both got on well till she just stopped messaging me (we had spoken every day since then) I figured I didn't want to come across as clingy so I left her to it for a day, I finally messaged her to see if she was okay and I got zero response. She's seen the message but for some reason just doesn't want to talk to me, I respect that and I'm leaving her to it. I would be lying if I said it doesn't sting a little, I thought I treated her well and for a brief moment, I had thought that I could get that feeling of being happy again ya know? If anything I'm just tired of trying. I feel pretty shit, I often think to myself that maybe without me knowing, my bitterness and shitty "why me" attitude seeps through this fake persona I try to sell.   I apologize for this being long and sorta disorganized, I just wanted to write more than anything. I appreciate you reading this far  TL;DR Felt good! Felt like I was making some progress, got rejected and now I just feel terrible again. Wondering if deep down I'm to blame 
That_Awesomeguy	I know the feeling all too much 
That_Awesomeguy	It's worse because I just harbor resentment for people that aren't lonely 😂. I know I shouldn't but it's hard.  so I end up becoming bitter and lonely aha
That_Awesomeguy	Sorry if this is an annoying question but could you possibly tell me the name of the song? 
That_Awesomeguy	Fucksake. I despise Aaron but damn he's got some decent striking, hopefully they'll step up the competition for his next fight?
That_Awesomeguy	I read somewhere she got cut directly after this 
That_Awesomeguy	Damn. I need to stop feeling so sorry for myself and enjoy life more - thank you for this, I wish you the best mate
That_Awesomeguy	I'll wait till you've turned your back first 
That_Awesomeguy	I remember a UFC fighter making a video about it. Apparently it's very common in Australia, we've had a few people die here in the U.K. From being sucker punched or "happy slapped" 
That_Awesomeguy	Um...are you sure? I've never seen someone do this in BJJ before. 
That_Awesomeguy	Ayyy was hoping to see someone say this 🥋

That_Awesomeguy	Ayyy congrats Mckenzie! 
That_Awesomeguy	I had no idea people could even do this..holy shit  
That_Awesomeguy	Hope it went well brotha 🙏🏼
That_Awesomeguy	I keep hearing mixed feelings on that pistol, some people saying it's not that great - it looks sick though so I'll probably crack on and unlock it 
That_Awesomeguy	You two need to just settle this in the octagon once and for all  
That_Awesomeguy	Been checking this sub all day hoping for the new comp 🙏🏼     Fuck I need a life...
That_Awesomeguy	Bit late, but would highly recommend a book called Butchers Crossing by John Williams. That book helped me through a very dark time 
That_Awesomeguy	Yes same here, I thought my headset was faulty 
That_Awesomeguy	I gave up and just shouted at my tv screen instead brotha 
That_Awesomeguy	Fucking hell..

That_Awesomeguy	I know how you feel, I have a tournament next month and I'm scared shitless 
That_Awesomeguy	For some reason I thought bobby green retired, will be a good fight none the less!
That_Awesomeguy	Seen this video a few times..it's the weird gorilla/retard grunts that confirm this dude is a fuckin nutjob. I keep hearing he got sent down for this yet never found a proper source 
That_Awesomeguy	Shit, I've never seen that before! That looks insane 
That_Awesomeguy	We are being spoiled lads!  Enjoy the summer violence while it lasts 
That_Awesomeguy	Thats a shame man..I thought they were pretty cool

That_Awesomeguy	He kinda looks like that "England is my city" fella 
That_Awesomeguy	That looks absolutely glorious 
That_Awesomeguy	I'm going to a local nightclub this Saturday and I'm actually worried about this exact scenario. I do train jiu jitsu, however, we both know that when the shit hits the fan it's better to walk away from a confrontation with 3 or 4 guys then stay and risk getting beat up. I think the best thing is knowing when to leave before the clubs start kicking people out. It's mainly outside where all the drunken idiots start to brawl..
That_Awesomeguy	Been invited to a nightclub on Saturday - Anxiety is off the roof | So I've never been clubbing, I'm not much of a drinker but I do enjoy music.   A couple of my friends have been asking me to go clubbing for a while and told me that it'll help me loosen up and relax. One side of me really wants to go but the other side thinks to just step in the door get some snapchat photos so I can pretend I'm an out going/fun person and then leave quickly. I know it'll be good for me to get out and enjoy myself but I'm so worried about what might go wrong.   I've seen way too many WordStar videos of drunken goons getting into fights in clubs etc I just can't stop worrying about it all
That_Awesomeguy	Oh yeah for sure. I was using UFC fighters as an example since this was posted in /r/MMA but you're right, boxers without a doubt would have it worse I imagine 
That_Awesomeguy	Wow that was really interesting. I had no idea concussions worked like that, now imagine how fucked the brain of an average UFC fighter is 
That_Awesomeguy	Sorry I couldn't find a better site but here is what [happened.](https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Tony_Ferguson_Loses_it_in_The_Ultimate_Fighter/10166532)
That_Awesomeguy	Is that the video where there were two girls in the back who were trapped? You could hear them screaming till the end..i'll never forget it
That_Awesomeguy	lmao..was that in blackpool by any chance?
That_Awesomeguy	Lmao 😂 Weidmans dad is going mental 
That_Awesomeguy	The Chris is back in the game boissss!
That_Awesomeguy	Brilliant stream right now - appreciated brotha
That_Awesomeguy	Hats off to both guys - good fight 
That_Awesomeguy	I remember seeing [this](http://gph.is/2djp4BW) gif of him a while back. Straight killer - growing up in Brazil he probably saw some crazy shit 
That_Awesomeguy	Badass photo !🤙🏼
That_Awesomeguy	Cheers for the info boss 🇬🇧🤙🏼

That_Awesomeguy	fuck..that was brutal.  Just like that one dude dead and the other probably locked up 
That_Awesomeguy	He said "He ate that shin" :) 
That_Awesomeguy	These Yankees mate, can never take a joke

1254k	I was going to kill myself over loneliness. | Through several accounts, I've posted on SuicideWatch several times in my life. Earlier this month, I was destined to end my life. Loneliness and depression were killing me, and fast. I thought of myself as worthless and destined to fail. I was counting down the days.  But I found someone.   I met him. He has similar issues to me - and we realized how similar we are. How relatable we are. And we love each other.   And nothing can change that. I'm so proud to say I'm alive, and finally *happy*.   Thank you for motivating me to live and stay optimistic.

notexactlypoetic	How do I talk someone off the ledge? | My friend had recently tried to kill herself. I was able to persuade her to keep going on with her life but I'm not sure if I was just lucky. She is mentally ill, this wasn't just a grab for her to get attention, and she has tried to kill herself in the past. Is there anything that can be remembered for future reference if she makes an attempt on her life again? Any advice is helpful. Thank you.
notexactlypoetic	Thank you so much
notexactlypoetic	She is already on meds
notexactlypoetic	It goes to show that even though Orwell himself was left wing, he wasn't a cheerleader for the left like so many on the left are. Orwell was against left wing oppression just as he was against right wing oppression, he just wasn't the type of person to shill for one particular wing.

notexactlypoetic	Wow I find it funny when I see a Nazi praising Russia, or any of Eastern Europe for that matter, seeing as the Nazis literally wanted to strip them of their homelands and/or kill them as they were seen as subhuman retards controlled by Jews. "An ethnic home for every race, except for the Slavs, their land is ours"
notexactlypoetic	Also there are very few protestants who believe all it takes is the mere confession that Christianity is true. Out of true faith generates works (I assume you are talking about the concept of Sola Fide in this post)
notexactlypoetic	I never understood why Orthodox seems to always be the neutral one between Protestants and Catholics, I mean, at the end of it all, the orthodox are still heretics by Catholic standards
notexactlypoetic	I mean sure, many Protestants believe that only the confession thematic Jesus is real will get them to heaven, but many Protestants do try and follow the Bible, I'm willing to say at least a sizeable minority. There are good Protestants who recognize faith generates works , just as bad ones who believe they are saved simply by the virtue of being Christians, but the same can be said for Catholicism

notexactlypoetic	So how you describe your beliefs, the Missouri Synod seems right for you.
notexactlypoetic	Sorry, I made an error thanks for pointing it out
notexactlypoetic	Edit: Orthodox but not Eastern
notexactlypoetic	Well, I believe that the Lutheran Church is a great place to be. We are Catholic but not Roman, and Orthodox but not Roman, but it really depends on your denomination, or "synod". ELCA is far more liberal and progressive, having women as clergy and ordaining gays, while WELS and the Missouri Synod opposes both and is far more conservative. 
notexactlypoetic	Well, the main message is that everything is temporal, so it is imperative to enjoy life while delighting in the lord, that might be why it's my favorite. It's down to earth, giving a realistic view of God's world, not sugar-coating anything.
notexactlypoetic	I'm not sure, I'm just looking to see if there's anything better than what I have
notexactlypoetic	Looking for answers | I am a protestant and I have been looking around and I wanted to know, is there anything I should know before deciding to convert to anything, or stay where I am? Note: non-Christians can answer this question as well 
notexactlypoetic	Well depends. I mean, besides the bread thing, which I admit is very miniscule, they would seem to have some sort of difference. Like for instance, the doctrines if papal supremacy and infallibility are rejected, the emperor supercedes the rule of the church, and the fact that Catholics claim the holy Spirit proceeds from the father and son, which is different from just the father
notexactlypoetic	I believe I have, it just seems as though the liturgy aspect of everything would be pointless if the theology was not correct
notexactlypoetic	Perhaps it might be how compelling other branches such as Orthodoxy or Catholicism are, and how you always see people converting to those but never the other way around. I mean, there would have to be a reason, right? And they always seem to have the tradition aspect down, which certainly to seems to boost their credibility
notexactlypoetic	How do I see past all of the things that Luther himself said that are theologically incorrect?

notexactlypoetic	About the ethnic barrier | I have been recently looking into the Orthodox Church. However, I am not Greek or Russian, Serbian etc. and don't know any of these languages.

notexactlypoetic	Remember Martin Luther | 
notexactlypoetic	On the topic of slavery | I have often heard that the Bible often jumps to justify slavery, and that the slavery in the South was often justified with certain verses, and that it had a better claim than the abolitionist Christians in the north. What are these verses and how are they justified?
notexactlypoetic	Yeah that helped alot, thanks
notexactlypoetic	Answers for questions that Christians may have about Socialism | 
notexactlypoetic	I apologize as I did not realize sort of the double standard I was setting for myself
notexactlypoetic	Thank you very much, is there anywhere I can go to to inform myself about the orthodox view on original sin/the nature of salvation?
notexactlypoetic	Why Orthodoxy? | I am currently a Protestant, a Lutheran to be more specific, and I was wondering why to convert to this branch of Christianity, and if you are going to point me in the direction of "muh tradition" or "muh one true church" I would like to say right here that I could just as easily go to Catholicism off of those grounds. Try and be respectful in the comments and thank you.
notexactlypoetic	What is liberation theology? | Over the past few months, I have been trying to explore political ideologies beyond the right wing. Among many of the questions I have is "What is the view of religion in a leftist society?" and I found tat there is a distinct train of thought within Christianity called Liberation Theology. Now I want to ask those who follow Liberation Theology if there is anything beyond the label of Socialist Christianity, and if there is any biblical legitimacy or verification.

notexactlypoetic	I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't be ok
notexactlypoetic	I'm kind of stuck right now. | I have been a christian conservative for quite a while now, however I am starting to look into more leftist ideologies and I wanted to know if there was anything that fits. I like Luxemburg's ideas on how the revolution should be run by the worker, and with a socialist society with a heavy emphasis on democracy. However, I guess it may be hard to leave conservatism for me, as it seems like every attempted socialist society has failed, crumbled or both, and it always seems to lead to internal problems, plus a factory run by the worker doesn't seem all that efficient. It also always seem to lead back to a big government. Are there any answers to these problems? Are socialists still allowed to be Christians?

notexactlypoetic	A father is infinitely more valuable than any amount of money. Your wife and your daughter need you, even if it doesn't seem like it now. The frivolous material things like a ring or a honeymoon don't really matte in the end. Because again, they need you infinitely more than any of those things.
notexactlypoetic	Understood. People often don't understand that every person is different, and that they react differently to eveything. One persons reaction to something is not the same as everyone else's. Perhaps your parents don't want to accept that because they would put the blame on themselves. Anyway, just know that if you don't have your parents, you always have someone else. Maybe a teacher, or a friend, or maybe even God (if you are a believer). Just know that while you may feel alienated, you aren't alone. Someone out there cares about you, someone out there may need you.
notexactlypoetic	So what about "contemporary icons"? | I've been seeing these around the internet lately. I wanted to know if it is okay to enjoy these as long as one does not venerate them as a traditional icon, or if it is sin.

notexactlypoetic	Welcome brother, may God guide you in all your efforts
notexactlypoetic	Well, for me it has always felt like a gigantic over-reaching centralized establishment like the Roman-Catholic church has always been a hindrance in getting people closer to God, i believe that religion should either be very local or regional, just not very centralized.
notexactlypoetic	I heard an analogy that once went like this, God knows the final score, but you still have to play the game.
notexactlypoetic	What's a secular church?
notexactlypoetic	1. You don't know if you're going to heaven as a christian. 2. All supposed "contradictions" in the Bible are easily disproven. 3. You don't have to believe based off any notion of "faith" to me, the two biggest things that prove the divinity of Christ and the validity of Christianity are the crucifixion and the martyrdom of the apostles.
notexactlypoetic	People need to remember there's already a term for those who believe they're the opposite sex, it's called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is classified as a mental disorder.
notexactlypoetic	Well technically, no churches are "left-wing" because he actual left wing is mostly secular. But the only other one I can name right now that is super liberal is the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America).
notexactlypoetic	"Proletariat"
notexactlypoetic	When I decide to marry an attractive non white man so i want to be beaten, raped, and I want any trace of my friends and my family to be wiped off the face of the earth.
notexactlypoetic	That homosexuality should be treated like it is, a sin, and following that logic that we should not treat them as perfectly acceptable or completely reprehensible like many do, but try to get them out of the cycle of that sin.
notexactlypoetic	Of course not, but in the same way you'd want an alcoholic to get out of his destructive lifestyle, you'd want to at least make an effort to bring them to Christ instead of abandoning them as a lost cause 
notexactlypoetic	Well, that kind of depends how you look at the concept of heaven. The orthodox view heaven and hell not as places but rather as states when we die and behold the presence of God. After all, the fire that burns the wood melts the gold, allowing it to glow even more. And what is our God but not a burning fire? Hopefully I was able to help even though I am not sure whether or not the view Ive presented is truly a belief held by most orthodox. Hopefully you can do your own research as Im sure youll find alot on the subject

notexactlypoetic	Please. Think of your family, think of those who care about you, think of all of those whose hearts would be shattered. Suicide isn't the only answer. Think of any reason you would like to stay on this earth. Remind yourself of those reasons as much as possible. God loves you.
jpegjhem	The degree to which loneliness affects people varies on an individual basis, not a gendered one. Some women experience more profound loneliness than some men, other women experience less profound loneliness than some men. 
jpegjhem	There is nothing after death and I wouldn't want there to be.
jpegjhem	What difference would it make if my life did get better? It would still be ultimately meaningless.
jpegjhem	The fact that I have "so much time to live" is the problem. I don't want that much time. I have no use for it.
jpegjhem	What's there to reach out about?
jpegjhem	There is no value in life, and therefore giving it up does not feel like a sacrifice. I have about as much emotional attachment to life as I would a used tissue.  Yes, people experience grief at death. What I'm saying is that this grief is a problem with how we as a society regard death. We shouldn't look upon it with sadness but instead with the clinical detachment it deserves.
jpegjhem	The difference is that you have dreams. I don't. And I don't see it as a drastic measure. I don't really see suicide as a big deal. I think that if someone feels that they have more to get out of their life, they should absolutely continue living it for as long as possible, for as long as they still enjoy it. But if there isn't anything that they can give the world or that the world can give them, why go to all the trouble of living? Waste of time, to be honest. 
jpegjhem	But if the grief of suicide is different to the grief of other causes of death, surely it is a problem with how we view suicide (and death in general) rather than a problem with suicide itself. Death is just death. It's not inherently bad or scary or tragic, it just is. My feeling is, if you enjoy your life then it's worth sticking around for, having a little bit of fun for as long as you can until you die. But if you don't enjoy it, why prolong the agony? If you aren't getting anything out of the experience of being alive, what's the point? It's ridiculous to stay alive just for the sake of it.
jpegjhem	Unlikely. It's unfathomable to me why anyone would even want to live that long. Living to be that old would be so boring.
jpegjhem	But why is the alternative worse? Why do you see death as worse than life?
jpegjhem	But my friends and family will be sad whenever I die, be it now or in 60 years.  Sadness at my death is inevitable. What difference does it make if I make them sad now or later?
jpegjhem	Question for those on here who try to "help." | Why do you comment on posts here? Why does it matter to you? Why is it so important to you that people who hate being alive, who can't bare another minute of existence, keep on keeping on? Why do you want us to force ourselves to live out a miserable existence until we inevitably die one day anyway? Why is it important to you that we continue to suffer rather than allow ourselves to be at peace?
dog_treat_for_human	Multi-month mental healthcare wait times are inhumane | Fuck you Manitoba healthcare.  I don't want my suicide to harm others. I want to get better.   But how am I supposed to pass the time while in an episode of major depression?

dog_treat_for_human	My suicidal thoughts didn't start until my 20's. Counselling and medication have helped me somewhat.   Sorry to hear that things are so shitty. 
dog_treat_for_human	> I would likely be taken out of school and put in a psychiatric hospital  This is incorrect. Only people who are actively suicidal can be hospitalized against their will. I once told an ER doctor that I would probably kill myself later in the week and I was released because I didn't have any plans to kill myself that day.  Suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts are very common among people with mental health problems. It's important to disclose this to the psychiatrist so that s/he can better treat you.  To talk about suicide with mental health clinicians and not be hospitalized, the magic words are *"I don't have any plans to kill myself today."*

dog_treat_for_human	Everybody is different. When I'm really low what benefits me is cuddling, getting out of the house with my partner - usually just going for a short walk. When she's feeling better, you should ask her what might help when she's feeling low.  Another important part is being supportive of her pursuing treatment ie. therapy and medication.  > She feels the same way, but when she gets depressed her feelings vanish.   When I'm in a very low mood I also have this reaction, not being able to feel anything toward my partner. It sucks :(

dog_treat_for_human	Exercise is really good for physical health.  I wouldn't beat yourself up though for not exercising if you're struggling with anhedonia and fatigue. I think that for many individuals, exercise does not improve mood. Exercise has never been helpful for me in improving my mood. Athletes don't have lower rates of depression. [There is no high quality evidence that exercise improves mood in individuals with depression.](http://www.cochrane.org/CD004366/DEPRESSN_exercise-for-depression)
dog_treat_for_human	I've had positive experiences telling friends. Social withdrawal is big part of my depression. Before I told my friends that I suffered from depression they assumed I disliked them and was avoiding them.  Telling my parents was useful because they were able to tell me about other mental illness in my family history, which was useful information for my doctor.  I've had mixed experiences telling employers.
dog_treat_for_human	Yes and no.  Most people with depression get good results from antidepressants and therapy. A minority of people do not. It's definitely worth trying though. Talk to your family doctor about it.

dog_treat_for_human	You have no obligation to disclose if it isn't impacting your performance.  If you do disclose, your employer should be concerned with whether s/he needs to provide accommodations (if they're competent that is, not everybody has this positive outcome).   Note that the employer usually has a lot of say in what accommodations they provide. For example, while you might prefer telecommuting they might push for reduced workload instead.
dog_treat_for_human	I had to see a few different psychiatrists before one prescribed me the right meds. I've had a lot of failures with meds too.  It's really frustrating waiting the months to see if new meds and/or dose-increases will work :( 
dog_treat_for_human	I remember also being unable to discern the difference between my depression and my personality before going on meds.  The way I describe what meds did for me is this: they unlocked my brain's capacity to feel optimism and positive emotions. I was still the same person, just more functional.

dog_treat_for_human	There is no Tylenol for mental distress | With physical illness there are usually pharmaceuticals that reduce pain/symptoms. There is no Tylenol for mental distress.

dog_treat_for_human	Mental illness is very common and most people with mental illness are treated by their family doctor. I think it's completely appropriate that he prescribed you a medication.

dog_treat_for_human	Your parents are definitely contributing to your depression by putting their needs before your own. Jonice Webb goes into this into detail in her book Running on Empty.   Most parents who behave like yours don't know any better and themselves had shitty parents. But it's still important for you to be aware of how they are failing you.  I have no idea what the solution is. If you have a different family member that you can confide in that would be helpful I think.

dog_treat_for_human	The long term consequence of suppressing emotions & feelings is depression.  Being appropriately vulnerable is an important social skill. Maybe check out some of the literature in the sidebar of r/socialskills and see if there's anything that resonates?

dog_treat_for_human	Hi, I am wondering if you've found any of these nootropics to be helpful?  Of those mentioned in your post, I've tried L-Theanine, fish oil, and Tianeptine. Fish oil didn't work. L-Theanime made me drowsier than I already am. I've only just started on Tianeptine so it's too early to say if it will work. Probably not though :P
dog_treat_for_human	What dose of tianeptine did you find to be therapeutic?
dog_treat_for_human	How long have you been on Tianeptine? Is it still working?

dog_treat_for_human	Experiencing emotions is kind of like being mildly drunk or high. Each emotion-drug has a specific and unique experience which is what makes each easily identifiable.  When I first started feeling emotions it was actually kind of scary because personality fluctuates with emotions. I thought I was going crazy.  Background: alexithymic for most of my life; emotional range has increased somewhat in recent years with improved mental health outcomes.
dog_treat_for_human	That was intentional, [according to one of the creators](http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-oa-producers-netflix-brit-marling-zal-batmanglij-1201942744/):  > **What do you want viewers to take away from the show?** > > If you’re a young woman, and you’ve been through a traumatic experience, and you feel like most of the stories out there keep you in the realm of the passive victimhood, and now you’re watching this story, the classic kidnapping story.

goldelux_	Depression & Women: Story survey | Admins please contact if not allowed or potentially triggering!  CW: sexual violence, ptsd  Hello wonderful people of reddit, long story short I'm writing because I was looking to hear stories from those who identify as women about their experiences with mental illnesses.  I'm an artist and photographer who works with poetry and text as part of my art - my honours project is about my own experiences as someone with depression and a survivor of sexual violence.  I'm currently in the most medicated time in my life, I was diagnosed at five and I'm twenty three now so my entire life feels like it's been shaped by this illness.   I want to make art about this because it helps me consolidate many of the traumatic things that has happened to me but also when I thought about the times that I wanted to die the thing that made me keep living was the fact that I wanted to help people. Help kids who grew up like me, were misunderstood like me, neglected like me.  If you want to get some stuff off your chest or just tell me about your life please message me xx
goldelux_	Eczema, anxiety & depression: aka cycle of misery | Hello from New Zealand kind strangers of reddit. New to reddit and on mobile so please excuse the massive wall of text that's coming your way.  I just need to vent.  I've been struggling with severe atopic eczema for the past few years, I had eczema as a kid and then it went away and when I turned 20 it came back with a burning vengeance. This time around it is seriously impacting my life in the most debilitating way. I have had long standing issues with depression and anxiety throughout my entire life and am getting treatment consistently to help manage this...   BUT, I'm feeling like my skin is a massive barrier to my recovery, and is also part of the fuel which many of you will already know. I am at the doctors at least once a month to treat infections - I do everything they say: moisturising, barrier creams, topical steroids, bleach baths, antihistamines, diet changes... everything. I feel like I'm exhausting my options and am trying my damn hardest to keep up a strict care regime and nothing works.  I just want to be normal. I want to be able to sleep properly and not have to vacuum up dead skin every day. I want my beautiful tattoos that make me so proud of who I am to go back to the way they were before eczema - now they are ruined and I watch my body decay every single day. I want people to understand that I'm in serious pain and I have a chronic illness and it's not just an itchy patch, I want my friends to realise that when I don't come out partying it's not because I'm a buzzkill it's because I'm at home washing blood stains out of literally everything I own.  So that's a short summary of my angst righty now, just came back from the pharmacy with prednisone and antibiotics so it's gonna be a GREAT week.    Side note; if I get told by one more person to do yoga to relax I'm gonna start swinging. 
goldelux_	I figured maybe unloading my baggage might help someone else along the way 💕 thanks for your comment
goldelux_	Yeah it's no change since I was a kid - dust is the big one so I vacuum once a day and change my sheets with eczema safe detergents and stuff
goldelux_	I would love to but it's not available in my country yet :( Looking on here it seems like a bit of a miracle drug, 
goldelux_	Thank you so much, even just posting here with people that understand how shit eczema is has done a world of good 💕
goldelux_	Thanks for the suggestion, I did find applying almond oil straight on my skin when it's not severe works as a better moisturiser than anything else I've tried! 
goldelux_	When I did the eczema diet they said you should only drink vodka / gin / whiskey so when I swapped out the wine life it did help a little. I feel you on the unemployable front - I'm in the fortunate position to be able to contract my work but selling yourself when you look like a walking lobster is fucking nerve racking
goldelux_	Thanks for your comment 💕 just feeling really frustrated at the moment and have been making some really positive progress in therapy and stuff and then I go home to this and feel like I don't have the control that I just tried to take back! I think I've been hexed along the way
goldelux_	Waking up under an avengers duvet cover (he was 24) was pretty special 
goldelux_	It's expensive! It takes a toll on your body physically which means lots of doctors visits, medications, therapy, not to mention taking time off work to recover physically and mentally.   Also if I get recommended to do yoga one more time I'm going to rage
goldelux_	Don't get bitter, just get better 
goldelux_	What makes you instantly dislike someone? | 
thisjetlife	I lurk there to hear about how my husband is apparently a Chad because he gets laid. He's a total nerd who plays Magic and got bullied his whole life for being the only Latino in a small town. He's just not a sociopath. 
thisjetlife	No problem dude. I've been in your situation many times and the kindness of strangers has helped me through. All I ask is you pay it forward when you can. Happy eating!
thisjetlife	Did you get it? Lemme know if it works. 
thisjetlife	Yeah, I'm a Lions fan and this did me a sad.   Edit - wonder if it's because it's Hyundai and the Lions are owned by the Ford family. 
thisjetlife	My favorite is LBJ which gets me a lot of controversial feedback. 
thisjetlife	Got an email it was delivered. Check your PMs, I sent the confirmation email. Wanna make sure I didn't mess anything up. 
thisjetlife	Give credit where it's due, man. Abe Lincoln said that. 
thisjetlife	Is there a way I can get you a pizza from the US?  Edit - I'm from Detroit and know Pizza Pizza well. I'd like to get you something better, unless of course that's your preference. 
thisjetlife	I'm a feminist and understand a lot of the dislike because the craziest are the loudest, but this is like straight up hating women for just being women. And they never heed the advice that if they change their attitude and just put in a little effort, there's someone out there for them. I think they must like misery. 
thisjetlife	Couldn't bring myself to do it. If there was a Raiders one I would've for my husband, but alas no luck. 
thisjetlife	He never really had low self confidence, he got really strong from being treated like shit. He used all his aggression towards hockey, which is how we met.   Edit before anyone goes into my history - we did meet online. In a hockey group. 
thisjetlife	Is there a way to hide something I buy on the PayPal account I share with my husband? | Before anyone thinks this is nefarious, it's not. I've been in a really bad bout of depression lately and he's been amazing through it all. I want to buy him a gift but I know he gets notifications on our shared account. If I buy it through Etsy or something it will just show the sellers name or something right? It won't describe the item? Sorry if this sounds dumb, I just want to make sure it's a surprise. 
thisjetlife	My grandma survived the Shoah and my uncle was stationed in Germany in WWII. When he died, we found a picture of him smiling holding a Nazis head he decapitated. Can confirm, that generation was badass. 
thisjetlife	I mean, it doesn't even take much work. They all want supermodel type girls who act like a '50s housewife and you can't explain to them it's unrealistic. 
thisjetlife	I got him a gift card, no worries. 
thisjetlife	You too. May G-d bless you in many ways.   Edit - also feel free to visit our temples. We don't mind. 
thisjetlife	No problem!
thisjetlife	Thank you. So much. 
thisjetlife	Argan Moroccan oil spray by Creme of Nature. Cost me $6. 
thisjetlife	Pondy is the coolest!
thisjetlife	Do you think a gift card from Pizza Hut will work in Canada? PM me your info. 
thisjetlife	They're like Asian incels with more racism. Oh what fun! But I totally get it, as a Jew I liked to visit the Daily Stormer just to laugh. 
thisjetlife	I'm very sorry. I hope you accept my apology. 
thisjetlife	What condition did I insult? I'm truly sorry if I did that, hun. 
thisjetlife	Nope. Freeway Ricky Ross was the real OG. 
thisjetlife	I want to thank you. | I'm Jewish and haven't eaten in two days. My local Sikh temple told me to come in and have a free meal. You are all so beautiful. I was so hungry I was suicidal. You saved me. I can't thank you enough. 
thisjetlife	Probably because her anus was too close to her vagina. 
thisjetlife	Four score and seven years ago we eliminated these bitch ass hoes. 
thisjetlife	Thank you. I'd love to give back what was given to me. I'm going to suggest my synagogue start doing this but tbh I don't even know the underfed would want Jewish food ;)
thisjetlife	I think I will. I would like to understand your religion more. I am embarrassingly uneducated on it. Will they allow me to help feed people even as a Jew? And can I say, this food was soo good. 
thisjetlife	He took on a heavy role after the assassination of JFK. He passed the civil rights act, which I don't believe JFK would've been able to do as he was a Boston Catholic and LBJ was a Texan evangelical. Ladybird taught undocumented Mexican immigrants in Texas, which made him have a heavy emphasis on education. He was responsible for PBS and TLC (this was before it stooped to Duggar and Honey Boo Boo levels). He made a bad choice with Vietnam, but it was basically forced upon him by republicans who opposed the civil rights act. I truly think he was great. 
thisjetlife	I don't know, but after living in Indiana where I was refused birth control and then later an IUD I'm pretty damn happy I live in California now.   I got married in San Diego but live about 9 hours away and they messed up my marriage certificate, so until I can afford to get there I can't be on my husband's insurance. So I broke my finger playing hockey and out of desperation, I called PP.  They said they only do reproductive health, but spent the time to look up a doctor near me who would take me at no cost and give me a reduced price prescription. They were also the only ones who took my pelvic pain seriously and found massive cysts and endometriosis, leading to me having an ovary removed. I hate the lies spread about what PP does because they're some of the best, most caring medical workers I've been treated by. 
thisjetlife	I have no food and I can't starve anymore. | I'm broke, someone stole my bank info so my check is being held until Monday. I'm so sick of living like this. I'm sick of hearing it'll get better. I don't have the time. My sister in law ate all of my food and refuses to put gas in our car even though she shares it and we drive 5 miles while she drives 35. I'm going to take the trazodone I've saved and get in the tub tonight. I'll drown and it'll be easy enough to clean up. I'm sorry to my husband, I love you so much. You're all I've had. I'm sorry to my parents. I can't do this anymore. 
thisjetlife	I KNOW NORIEGA, THE REAL NORIEGA.  Sorry, had to bust into random Rick Ross. 
thisjetlife	I know that, I'll just look it up on google because as Stephen Colbert said "real Americans fail geography"
thisjetlife	I like how she's more concerned about Rihanna being slandered than random internet people calling her fat. Also, she grew up to be really pretty!
thisjetlife	I live in California and agree with this legislation. 
thisjetlife	Very beautiful. I'd still like to speak with a Sikh and have a conversation about how our religions differ. 
thisjetlife	I called my local Sikh temple even though I'm Jewish. They've promised me a meal at anytime. Thank you so much Sara.  - your friend Cait
thisjetlife	Thank you. I am still here. I will hang on as long as I can for my husband, the most wonderful human I've ever met. Thank you for caring. 
thisjetlife	May G-d bestow his blessings on you, as well <3
thisjetlife	Honestly, I was surprised Indiana went red after Trump picked Pence. Well, surprised isn't the right word. I guess just shocked at the stupidity. He was an awful governor. Also, an awful human. 
thisjetlife	That's my opinion, sorry I forgot I'm on Reddit where fat people are considered subhuman scum. 
thisjetlife	I'm not a pedophile if that's what you're implying lol, I'm a happily married straight woman giving another woman a compliment. 
thisjetlife	Mike Pence 2: electric boogaloo
thisjetlife	Not going to lie, that movie gets to me even if that quote is hilarious out of context. 
thisjetlife	Couldn't have done it without you. Hugs <3
thisjetlife	A Time To Kill, but as someone below me pointed out earlier it was a book first. 
thisjetlife	Why is that?
thisjetlife	Well, I've nothing to do with Israel. I'm American through good times and bad. 
thisjetlife	Well, I am a generic American liberal :) We Jews exist in a diaspora and America is part of it. 
thisjetlife	Yes, I am. 
thisjetlife	Hijacking top comment to ask where this is located in Germany. I'm American but have spent time there, mostly in Bavaria. Would love to see other parts. 
thisjetlife	By the way, I promise you I don't report anything. I like to talk to people to hopefully change their minds. 
thisjetlife	Hmm, whys that? Is it because it doesn't add up or you dislike Jews? Let's please have a pleasant conversation. I want you to know me as a human being. What doesn't add up?
thisjetlife	Thank you. I'm crying from this and can't say much more. Thank you. 
thisjetlife	Anti semitism is worse. Would you like to speak about something else?
thisjetlife	San Jose is a little far from me, but I may make a day trip. Thank you. 
thisjetlife	I will throw it out now. 
thisjetlife	Thank you. I will when he's home from work, promise. 
thisjetlife	Thank you. I'm going to call around. You've really saved me tonight. 
thisjetlife	Cruz on the porn site. 
thisjetlife	You can message me anytime. We will be each other's anchors to life. 
thisjetlife	Don't mind me, I'm just going to get this hard drive I hid under the floorboards. 
thisjetlife	Love to you too. And tell her fuck off for those strawberries. 
thisjetlife	I remember what my ahava told me - everything is temporary. 
thisjetlife	I'm a religious Jew and I eat pork, but not very often. 
thisjetlife	Chill out, Adolf.   Edit - actually, don't be a pussy. Post a picture of yourself so we can judge you. 
thisjetlife	This makes me so sad for you because I know the exact situation. 
thisjetlife	We should all be so lucky to forget him. 
thisjetlife	True, but I still think she grew up to be pretty. We don't know her life tbh, if my parents didn't teach me how to cook and eat healthy I would likely be pretty overweight as well.
thisjetlife	We probably should've gotten a less intense black guy, but we don't have any on our roster. 
thisjetlife	The fuck is je? Are you speaking French? I'm not going to report you if that's what you're worried about. I'll PM you a selfie of myself if you do the same for me. I'm not gonna stalk you, hurt you, whatever you're afraid of. 
thisjetlife	Even as a Jew, that doesn't offend me. Get some fucking new offensive sayings. Your shit is played out. 
thisjetlife	Well, we Jews have horribly hard to manage hair and I wanted to share a life changing product lol
thisjetlife	lol I found it looking for a sub for Jewish hair. Whatever, I'm used to anti Semitic bullshit. 
thisjetlife	True, but I am a woman lol. 
thisjetlife	Pretty sure that's not what they were saying. Obesity is an epidemic in America and we really should address it rather than accept it. Yes, there are legitimate medical reasons people are overweight but those are likely the minority. The lack of access to healthy food in a lot of areas, the fact that it costs more to eat healthy than eat junk, the fact that many urban areas have food deserts. We shouldn't just look the other way and accept it.   I don't fat shame people or look at them in disgust, but we need more education in this country on eating healthy. I'm low income, but luckily we have a community garden and my mom taught me how to cook so I don't eat like complete crap. Unfortunately, a lot of people here work so much it's easier to grab McDonald's than make a meal. 
thisjetlife	Neither are gingers, but I don't hold it against them. 
thisjetlife	YOU are the bad person. I hope everything bad happens to you and only you. 
thisjetlife	Well, lets address some points. I never "bragged" about Jewish I was and have never once claimed to keep Pasach. Two, I was raped when I was 12. Not that it's any of your business. Three, you took my "I'm not a pedophile" comment out of context. I paid a young woman a compliment and everyone jumped on me because she was overweight. Four, I'm not a victim. I'm not allowed to delete that post in RAOP but I ate at my local Sikh temple. Five, if you were so inclined to go through my history you'd see I'm suicidal and your treatment of me doesn't make me feel better. So kindly, go fuck yourself. You have no idea of my life or how I have to live.   You skipped out on some key points like someone stole my fucking identity. You called me a pedophile ignoring the context of the comment. I'm a 29 year old woman and don't condone pedophilia. You probably creeped through my comments hoping for kiddie porn yourself, you creep. I'll pray for you like I do for everyone. You creep. 
thisjetlife	A Planet Hollywood jacket?! They don't even make those anymore. 
thisjetlife	I'm Jewish. | Why do you guys hate me? Wanna talk? Let's have a conversation. I like pizza, football (Lions baby), Hip Hop, smoking weed, and generally being chill. So let's talk. Put aside the hate for a second and AMA. 
thisjetlife	So, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this but I'm not using names and it was years ago. My mom served jury duty in Detroit for a woman who was on trial for pulling a gun on her boyfriend. Her boyfriend was abusive and she discovered that he had been molesting her 7 year old daughter as well. She told him to get out of her house, and he beat her pretty badly. So she went down the street and borrowed her neighbors gun. There were no bullets in the clip, but the guy didn't know that. She pulled it on him and told him he could either die right there or leave. They arrested her for having an illegal gun, and some other charges I don't remember. She was acquitted on all charges and went free. 
thisjetlife	Well, aren't you a ray of fucking sunshine. 
thisjetlife	Exactly. 
thisjetlife	I am a lawyer for the defense and ask for a plea deal to bring it up to an even 5. 
thisjetlife	This is better than my idea for Codka - cod flavored vodka. 
thisjetlife	I agree. I live in a neighborhood that's low income and we had a HUGE problem with crimes. We got a new mayor who instituted policies like community policing, a program that takes ex felons or any residents of the community and gets them certified for construction, plumbing, hazmat, etc. (my husband is actually in it, he's not a felon but the certifications will help with his degree), and instituted a community garden. Our crime rate dropped substantially, and homicide was lowered 47%. TBH, that's probably more the policing and BUILD program, but I just thought it was cool we were able to do that. 
thisjetlife	Yo, Eritrea. Where da cash at?
thisjetlife	I laced my coffee with cocaine but because of my crippling 20 year addiction I feel fine. 
thisjetlife	I agree, that's basically what I was saying. I also think we need more community gardens and such. 
thisjetlife	I'm gonna go house some beef!
thisjetlife	[Request] bank info stolen | So I was supposed to have a small check coming in today but because my bank info was stolen last week they're holding it until Monday. I wanted to go grocery shopping, but I can't. If anyone can help I promise to pay it forward or return the favor. 
thisjetlife	My paycheck got held up until Monday and I can't go grocery shopping. | [removed]
thisjetlife	lol touché 
thisjetlife	Oh shit, I can't remember 😂😂
thisjetlife	What if my daughter is a fish whore? What then?
thisjetlife	I feel I've been repeating this on Reddit all day, but the US needs more community gardens. I'm going to start helping at the one in mine, I've been in a really depressed state and haven't left the house much. Finally got out for Mexican food and for a pick up game of hockey, and I think this is the next step for me. 
thisjetlife	Thanks, not sure why I got downvoted for asking that. I try to keep up with everyone, I knew y'all were voting  but I didn't know the exact dates. When there's a new scandal in your country every day, it gets hard. 
Junglistblapblap	Loneliness and self hatred | I often find myself craving any sort of attention, any is never enough. Yet, at the same time the thought of people seeing me and who I am sickens me, so I isolate myself. 
Junglistblapblap	First day of play on PS4 | [removed]
Junglistblapblap	Would love to hear the authors motive behind this story.  I don't see where people are getting depression and homelessness from, this just seems like a supernatural basis to me. 
Junglistblapblap	Zerker is totally viable and needs nerfing, not buffing.  On console he's impossible to react to he's feinting into lights, you end up with 200ms attacks that come out so fast the animation doesn't even finish.  I won 3 tournaments with cent, struggling against zerkers constantly.  Started playing zerker against a bot for an hour or so, took him into tournament and boom, instant win. Guys broken as hell, but because it's usually only kids who play him, they whine when they lose because it must be his lack of openers, not their skill.  All of the cast are totally viable and possible to win with (kensei aside), just because the tryhards all use the easiest characters (warlord/noobushi/PK) doesn't mean EVERYONE else is low tier and useless. 
Junglistblapblap	Referring to things as 'tech' should be a ban-able offense too. Christ. 
Junglistblapblap	You use full English when you address an adult you little shit.
Junglistblapblap	Well its not, because as I said you wouldn't say a word to my face (if you could even reach it).  Oooh a fat joke! Something else you wouldn't do in person. Bring your father to me, then you can watch me slap him for creating such a cunt of a child. Slap that whore of a mother of yours as well, then she can suck me whilst you apologise. 
Junglistblapblap	Ha, no I didn't. What I did was point out that you're obviously a small boy with little man syndrome who gets bullied and mouths off on the internet, whereas I'm 6'3, 18st and an adult, who can back up my words. I won't fight you, I'll fight your dad though. FIGHT ME IRL BREH 
Junglistblapblap	No, you're whiny. I'm pointing out flaws, you're the one who whines on everything I post because it's usually about broken characters and being a little bitch, you obviously abuse broken characters.   You're literally the worst type of human imaginable, gobby as anything on the internet because you get bullied in real life. I'd love to meet you and see how gobby you are when you're face to face with my waist you poor little keyboard warrior. 
Junglistblapblap	Oh I know, the 'top' players are the worse for being scumbags. Only time anyone's exceptionally good at this game is when they're cheating and abusing game mechanics. Professional play on this game is cancer. 
Junglistblapblap	Who said I didn't beat him? He's trying to use dirty tactics, which I think should be a punishable offense. I guess the devs for this game are dirty little scumbags like 99% of the playerbase. 
Junglistblapblap	So unlocking to start up combos is allowed? Well that's vile and pathetic. Thanks, I won't bother. The devs of this game clearly don't give a shit about having a fair game. 
Junglistblapblap	Is unlocking an offense? | Surely unlocking attacks to make them unparryable is considered cheating? If so, how do you report someone? Have video evidence of a player using it (surprise surprise its a zerker)
Junglistblapblap	Unlocking on purpose should be considered a ban-able offense, as the players' obviously trying to cheat the system. 
Junglistblapblap	Unlocking on purpose should be considered a ban-able offense, as the players' obviously trying to cheat the system. 
Junglistblapblap	Great idea, until your cat walks over it. 
Junglistblapblap	Oh shut up. 
Junglistblapblap	Vikings in this game are just extremely lame. They're not real vikings, they're dweebs. Samurai would be great, except nobushi and shinobi aren't actually samurai. Knights are probably the coolest faction. Just a shame they're all scumbags, bar conqueror obviously. 
Junglistblapblap	Hardly. My opinion on something doesn't make me salty, you're the one coming in here crying so ergo, you're the 'salty' one. FYI 'salty' discredits everything, if you want to use childish words go play CS:GO or something equally childish and pathetic.   So now warlord is nerfed , people will use other Characters? OH NO!  I like how you mentioned glad in the same instance as cent and PK, as if glad is anywhere near top tier hahaha.  You realise glads dodge is broken and they've said they're going to fix it? If you struggle with him now (you must be awful to struggle with glad haha) you're going to HATE him when his dodge is fixed. 
Junglistblapblap	Again, I don't think the counter slash is gone, you still get that OR a non guaranteed heavy. that's how I understood it.  He also has a faster top light now, so that's a buff. The rest of the damage changes are very fair and needed. 
Junglistblapblap	No. He's been given more options if anything, but they've been toned down. Every character should have more options, but make them less of a necessity. Every character currently relies on 1 or maybe 2 combos, that's boring and leads to pathetic fights. Warlord is the king of the turtles and needed knocking down a few pegs. 
Junglistblapblap	So it doesn't feel like half the games missing? It does look beautiful, I loved 1 but got very sick of the 'new' dlc that was just stuff removed from the original full game 
Junglistblapblap	You were done a long time ago pahaha. Go in peace my friend. 
Junglistblapblap	Top players all play warlord and PK so dunno what you're on about.  'Ermagherrdd ur so salteeeh'. Typical for honor loser. You people sicken me. 
Junglistblapblap	You clearly just dont know how to fight glad, he's at best middle tier even with a fixed dodge.  You're that guy who I feint the shit out of and destroy 3-0 without getting hit once hahaha salty little bitch 
Junglistblapblap	Stubbornest? Nice word brah.  That's obviously from before hyper armor stopped GB. Sort your life out pahaha
Junglistblapblap	A salt post? How? I'm happy about what they've done, its you that's salty because they've lowered your poor little top tier character apparently.  Grow up. 
Junglistblapblap	Well I disagree and I'm glad he's been adjusted. Hopefully this is more of a nerf than I think and he's played a lot less. 
Junglistblapblap	That's the long version yeah, thanks.  Fairly sure the shield counter is a non guaranteed heavy OR a light though? 
Junglistblapblap	Man I love that steampunk, just a shame they're so low wattage. 
Junglistblapblap	Well yeah I guess that's true. I figured that even the saltiest of the salty realised how massively overpowered warlord has always been, but apparently not. 
Junglistblapblap	Opinions on Destiny 2? | What's the general feel of this then? Who likes it, who doesn't? Why do you feel the way you do? Is the game half of what they said it is, like the first? Is the game obviously consisting of playing the same 5 levels over and over? Is it really a new game, or just an expansion with a fake name?  Enlighten me!
Junglistblapblap	Well I did, because all the changes I said are right, I just missed some because obviously the source I had was different to yours. stop being such a little girl.  He's getting some buffs yeah, my point was that it's hardly a nerf as much as it is a rebalance. 
Junglistblapblap	You still here? Get a life pal Jesus. there's no point in arguing with people who think they're right when they have no idea what they're talking about.
Junglistblapblap	Hahahaha behave, he will still be one of the top characters. 
Junglistblapblap	If you actually read my post, you'd see that I said to point out any mistakes. Feel free to do so or add any that I missed, otherwise grow up and stop crying you salty little bitch. 
Junglistblapblap	Lol shut up. Attacks should be reactable, there shouldn't be a single 50/50 in the game. It's very easy to beat assassin classes as warlord, all he needs to do is block and get free hits. That's cheap and dirty and I hope he gets even more nerfs in the future. 
Junglistblapblap	Well, all those things got adjusted. Shut up. 
Junglistblapblap	All the warlords crying and its not even a big nerf!? | Christ, the amount of people crying about it made me think they'd taken his shield away or something, when really they've done a reasonable and much needed balance (probably the first ACTUAL balance and not just a total nerf or total buff).  For those unaware (if I miss any adjustments please correct me), the warlord changes as I understand them are; Full block now doesn't give a GB.  The parry counter now grants a heavy attack as well as a light (very powerful, not sure I agree).  Side light attacks weaker.  Top light attacks stronger (REALLY?).  Heavy attacks weaker across the board (thank God).  Headbutt slowed down.   So really, he's still going to be the best character. None of his main abilities or skills are lost, how people are complaining so much is crazy.  Shows how many people abuse warlord to win, it's a shame he hasn't received more of a nerf.   How his zone attack hasn't been slowed down by 500ms is beyond me, but I guess the devs are happy for half the cast to have a 'safety button'. 
Junglistblapblap	No, zerk is that bully who doesn't go to lunch, he's out in the halls stealing kids' lunch money because he's stronger than them, but he also has lovely parents and everyone thinks he's super polite and a lovely young man.  
Junglistblapblap	...I literally have no idea what you're talking about. Wrong thread I reckon mate. 
Junglistblapblap	What else are new cameras for?
Junglistblapblap	He doesn't even want the money. He just wants to be loved. BUT NO ONE LOVES HIM. 
Junglistblapblap	He posted it above dude 
Junglistblapblap	Thanks dude, you the mvp
Junglistblapblap	Where is this warlord nerf info? | Trying to find these announced changes but all I see is countless memes (kudos people, much wow)
Junglistblapblap	The heavy after a parry isn't really free is it, all characters get a free heavy off a parry.  The heavy after a charged jab is a combo, so not free damage.  A free light after a kick, yeah great.  Warlord gets a free light off any block, a free light from headbutt (like the cent kick), a free hit or headbutt off full block stance block, plus all his hits have superior. 
Junglistblapblap	Good riddance. The less long ranged defenders there are, the better. You're supposed to be defending, not offending. 
Junglistblapblap	Warlord players; 'I know warlord has been the best character since day one, but centurion is sooooo overpowered, even though he's easily counterable and doesn't get any free hits like I do' 
Junglistblapblap	Bug post patch | [removed]
Junglistblapblap	Hahaha you cannot GB the shugoki when he hasn't been hit once. I don't think you understand hyper armor. 
Junglistblapblap	Lol parrying nobushi lights, you must be a pc player. I wish It were possible to parry lights consistently on ps4. 
Junglistblapblap	Sounds like you need to grow up and get a life then you sad little boy, if you need to get your kicks from mouthing off on the internet.   Partying is too strong, yes-that's why I suggested changing it.   Berzerker flawed? Sure, that's why the diamond division is full of them. Must be awful.   You obviously just don't agree, but instead of saying 'hmm I don't agree, here's an alternative' it was 'DERR I DONT LIKE DAT IDEA SO IM GOING TO BE RUDE AND PRETEND IM A BIG MAN EVEN DOW IM STUPID AND MY WIFE RESENTS ME BECAUSE OF MY CHILDISHNESS'.  Fuck outta here with your nonsense.  
Junglistblapblap	Well, even the official tournaments were plagued with peacekeepers spamming lights, to the point where they banned her. So idk man, you should probably start playing in the pro leagues if you can parry her zone flicker as well. 
Junglistblapblap	I feel like if you can parry the fastest attacks in the game, you must be the best player in the world. Why aren't you playing pro bro. 
Junglistblapblap	Well no, because the minute someone suggests something's broken on the forums, everyone starts with the 'well you must just be bad, git gud' Because they're insecure, sad little people. 
Junglistblapblap	...That already happens. 
Junglistblapblap	Reiterating doesn't do anything when your original points weren't true. Literally none of what you said was right, it's horribly wrong. Yeah there we go, 'if I've never seen it before but you say you have then it must mean you're shit', nah it actually means that you're a moron who doesn't understand the game enough to see flaws. 
Junglistblapblap	You're probably playing people with awful connection and yours is good, like me. I've never been able to parry nobushi lights, most of the time I can't even block them they're so fast. 
Junglistblapblap	I mean, the console isn't limited to 30 FPS, the game is. It makes no sense, a ps4 pro could easily run it at 60 but it's limited.  Frame rate isn't the biggest issue, the big one is a low refresh rate. I like to play console on a 90 inch curve tv, whereas lots of tryhards will be playing on a monitor with much higher refresh rate. That's no-one's fault but mine, however this is the only game where it's an issue so it's extremely annoying. All things considered, I do pretty well anyway, but it'd be nice to see them balance it for console fairly instead of expecting us to react to 100-200ms attacks regularly. 
Junglistblapblap	1. The lights are 500ms before timesnap and assuming both players have a low ping which they seemingly never do. Mines about 35ping on fibre optic, on average FYI.  2. Well that's just not true. Their heavies are faster than most characters' lights and extremely powerful, his top heavy is one of the most powerful hits in the game.   3. They do feint lights somehow, I know they're not supposed to but they do. Zerker players are cheaters and scumbags, they find ways. 
Junglistblapblap	Wow, some reasoning, backed up with ACTUAL knowledge! Wasn't expecting that. Imagine playing on a tv, on console, with a high speed internet connection against zerkers lagging like crazy with 100+ ping. That shits impossible. Whilst it'd be nice to say that these are isolated cases, they're not. This game punishes people for having fast internet and reward people for using broken characters.   I am glad you mentioned orochi, another hated character (who I actually played a lot). Another character that rewards scumbaggery, utilising zone flicker and top lights can win literally every time. Another character who some say is underpowered because of their lack of moves, but are actually insanely good BECAUSE of their lack of moves. 
Junglistblapblap	Yeah, flawed as in 'he needs more options', whereas he's actually flawed in the 'needs removing from the game' sense. 
Junglistblapblap	Do I legitimately trust the ranking system. Well seeing as its based on how many games you win, yes I trust it.  Do I trust that people play fairly to win? Of course not, because people like you exist who think berzerker is totally fine and having lightning fast attacks and high damage is balanced.  Attacking when they have super armor is stupid, that's not the problem. They feint 400ms light attacks into another light, becoming physically impossible to beat unless you run away. They are undoubtedly the best character (to anyone who isn't retarded) and the only way to beat a good zerker is to be playing as a character with a shield or hyper armor.   I don't know what type of reaction you think you're getting, because all I see is you struggling to come up with any sort of response besides spouting bullshit and crying. I'm killing myself laughing at the nonsensical shit you come up with, you're just another forum nerd with no life or clue how to play whatever game you're crying about. 
Junglistblapblap	Lol the competitive community. That 'data' is bullshit, even the devs have said so. It's nonsense, they just lie to make it seem like their precious lawbringers don't have the fastest attacks in the game. 
Junglistblapblap	No, you're a pathetic wimp because you can't give any sort of constructive input, so you just mouth off because you're safe on the internet and you like to pretend you're a big man.  You haven't explained anything, all you've done is say 'derrr I disagree becuz I don't understand da geeeeem'. One day, you'll actually see a vagina and become a man. Then you may have some input. 
Junglistblapblap	Lol how can you be such a retard? Don't talk about a game you clearly know nothing about. 
Junglistblapblap	Oh I see, I suggest some changes to a broken game so I must be mad. Go on, be a child and call me salty too.  Your argument has just nullified itself, pathetic little wimp. 
Junglistblapblap	You can't GB him when he has hyper armor, so shows what you know. 
Junglistblapblap	His light attacks are on par with assassins at 400ms currently, he's one of the top characters. 
Junglistblapblap	Unique aspects? Guaranteed damage isn't unique, it's across the board and its cheap. As a centurion, you'd be up shit creek which is clearly why you disagree. Probably play lawbringer too don't you, probably think spamming the same combos as all the other losers makes you really good. 
Junglistblapblap	Tbf, that's what you get as a nobushi. Most underrated character in the game, she's so powerful and yet no one seems to realise.  When you've got a zone attack that's one of the fastest moves in the game that's ALSO the most powerful, you can't really complain mate. 
Junglistblapblap	You realise they're changing parry? That's already being implemented. so the one point you disagree with, is the one that's actually happening.   I want shugoki to be useless, he should be. He has ridiculous damage and speeds that match assassins, Why should he also get free cheap hits? He's a pointless character used by the talentless. 
Junglistblapblap	How would they become worse? Berzerker would lose his hyper armor, meaning no more 'hit until you're stopped' bullshit. Centurion could no longer get free hits of kicks and punches (besides charged ones, easy to dodge). Gladiator would get better yeah, but he should do he's one of the fastest characters! 
Junglistblapblap	Why should you get guaranteed damage? Characters with guaranteed, free damage are the obvious top characters (warlord, lawbringer, centurion), they're what ruin the game. You should not get a single piece of free damage, ever. 
Junglistblapblap	It'd certainly stop you lawbringers being such dirty little turtles. 
Junglistblapblap	You've obviously never seen two good kensei fight, it's exactly what a fighting game should be.   Guard break should be pretty useless, it's supposed to break someone's guard not get free damage on them.   This wouldn't improve the turtle meta at all, it would completely dissolve it. How can you turtle if blocking, parrying and waiting give you nothing? You'd be forced to fight. 
Junglistblapblap	Kensei players always get my utmost respect (because I main one). They're literally the only character who doesn't have some bullshit trick, all they have is mind games and skill. I got to the finals in diamond 2 with kensei, then lost to a lawbringer who did nothing but spam shove+light. Nice and fair obviously, he gets free hits and I can't even touch him. But lawbringers are TOTALLY balanced right. 
Junglistblapblap	Well that's what she gets for raising a troubled degenerate son who plays lawbringer because he gets bullied. Spam that bitch all day. 
Junglistblapblap	Well seeing as its guaranteed, no, you can't.  Same as you can't dodge a light after conquerors shove, or cents kick, or shinoobis kick, or anyone's unblockable shove moves.
Junglistblapblap	No, I kiss yours. 
Junglistblapblap	Yeah, noobushis do need to git gud I agree. 
Junglistblapblap	Good? Nobushi is a scumbag, she needs some nerfs. 
Junglistblapblap	How to fix the turtle meta in 3 small steps | 1. Stop free guard breaks;  There should be no instance where blocking an attack gives a free GB, nevermind some characters' main attacks.  Parry shouldn't grant a free GB (think this is already being implemented).  Feinting into guard break shouldn't be possible.  2. Parrying attacks should lower stamina; If you're turtling and fishing for parries, not only should they not guarantee a GB, they should drain stamina. Parrying is too safe, creating the turtle meta.   3. Remove all free hits; Shoves should not guarantee a hit.  Blocks should not guarantee hits (or GB).  Dodging around enemies' Shoves/kicks should not guarantee a hit.   What would these changes do? They'd force people to start playing tactically. No more free hits, no fishing for parries, no turtle meta in general. No waiting for your opponent to move, then punishing it with zero risk to yourself.   Have you ever watched two kensei fighting? It's glorious, because they don't get free hits (besides dodging shoves), it's what makes him the only balanced character in the game.   Every character should adhere to the same rules, then we'll finally have a working combat system.
Junglistblapblap	Would be great, if you hadn't used zone attack. Samurai fight with honor, they don't use a cheap attack like that. Shame on you. 
Junglistblapblap	People still play Conqueror? 
Junglistblapblap	Valkyrie isn't broken, I said she's a scumbag not broken.  That's ok, you're in with all the other berzerker players who enjoy him because he's broken and cheap. I know you don't have any honor or morality, but rest assured everyone else knows you're a wanker who's been bullied all his life. 
Junglistblapblap	It's not that bad is it you little bitch.
Junglistblapblap	Wow, everyone on these forums is such a cunt.  I couldn't just not fight, because he'd won the first two rounds (by spamming lights and ZA), therefore if we drew he'd win.   People whinging about cent are the type of people who think peacekeeper is totally fine, despite being the fastest, buggiest character in the game and having been removed from other leagues in the past.   This fucking community...
Junglistblapblap	'Peacekeeper is totally fine and not a scumbag' | 
Junglistblapblap	This is NOT sexual assault. Jesus Christ, you gave full consent and were nervous, everyone is in first time sexual encounters. Do NOT get it into your mind that you were raped, as someone above suggested.   You're not a lesbian just because a girl fubbed you off, you're you. Don't try to label it, just decide whether or not you want to do it again with this girl because she's clearly into that.  I say go for it, what have you got to lose? Have some fun, it won't hurt you. 
Junglistblapblap	No no no, you misunderstood. A rep 6 BERZERKER doesn't play properly, because berzerker players are sad lonely little people who have to play the dirty characters. It's the same with all Viking players. Zero honor, zero skill.   I'm a total rep 53 (not amazingly high, but high enough that I know the game well) in diamond division, I know enough about berzerker thanks.   People that play berzerkers are what's wrong with 'the community' (a bunch of nerds screaming about how good their nerdy overpowered character is).   Go learn someone who isn't a broken overpowered piece of shit. 
Junglistblapblap	Excuses for what? Being diamond rank 3? Yeah, hardly.   A rep 6 knows nothing pal, just how it is. This isn't a game where skill comes from the player, doesn't work like that (especially with berzerker). This game is a matter of 'how dirty can I play and not get bored or caught being a scumbag', and the few of us that play properly of course (but as a rep 6 berzerker that's not you). 
Junglistblapblap	Sorry pal, but a rep 6 berzerker IS pretty easy to beat. A good berzerker is a scumbag, they use unlock cheats constantly, feint every attack, GB feint, abuse their broken GB anyway, they're awful.  Ranked is absolutely full of berzerkers winning, I'd love to see the stats after a few weeks, then people can stop pretending zerker is 'mid tier' (LOL) and start nerfing him. 
Junglistblapblap	Can we also add 'make quickscoping impossible at close range'? That shit requires zero skill, pressing 2 buttons at once and abusing the terrible auto aim mechanics. Cod only keeps it in for the kids (who aren't even legally allowed to play and have no say whatsoever), quickscoping ruins this game. 
Junglistblapblap	Ah, then please forgive my assumption. Its hard to imagine anyone else having any sort of honor in this game/community. 
Junglistblapblap	Oh I see, my bad I thought you were saying that was how to play orochi. Yeah I agree, that type of gameplay is what's plagued this game since day one. It is very boring to play like that, but unfortunately that's what wins. Top lights+zone attack+turtle=easy wins. 
Junglistblapblap	He has no mixups, what he has are the fastest feint recoveries in the game. Pair this with lag, add timesnap issues and what do you get? A broken character. Fuck berzerkers and everyone who plays as them. Zero skill involved. 
Junglistblapblap	Hold on. So you think waiting for them to attack then hitting them with top lights is fine? You don't think that's disgusting play? That's why they need to make his top lights slower and give him some more options, so players like me can use him properly and players like you can rage and go play call of duty or something. 
Junglistblapblap	They will change it, as they've already stated that it's too fast so shows what you know.  As it goes, I've pointed out about 5 errors to Ubisoft and every single one of them has been fixed or is being looked at (not necessarily on my account), so you can go have fun parrying the fastest attack in the game in bronze division. 
HoboWithAGlock	He can also slow down time.    It's weird he doesn't do in game more often, though.
HoboWithAGlock	Pretty much.  Mexico City (or London, or any other city that's far away) would only ever work for the NFL.  And even then, it'd be brutal travel-wise.
HoboWithAGlock	That's Wilt for you.
HoboWithAGlock	Yeah, I shouldn't have implied that I think Best Buy is below me or something.    It's more just indicative of my life right now, and it sucks to think about.
HoboWithAGlock	Thanks.  I appreciate it.    I'm sure I'll get the Best Buy job, but the feeling that comes with having to sink to it at this point (and not getting out of the state) makes me want to just intentionally blow the interview.
HoboWithAGlock	My Life is a Fucking Nightmare | I can't believe I'm making another /r/depression post, lmao.  But you guys are all I got at sometimes.  I'm an almost 24 year old NEET living with my parents in a state I don't want to be.  I'm almost out of money to pay for my school loans, and despite having like 200 job applications out in the last couple months, I have virtually zero job prospects right now.  I had a high GPA from a good university, I had internships, etc., so it's not like my life has been a fuck up or anything.  I'm interviewing with Best Buy tomorrow.    I honestly don't know where I'm going or what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm back in place where it feels like one bad day is all it'll take for me to just end it.  This shit is a living fucking hell.  The worst part is I see friends and family who are doing so much better than me, who are living lives a would kill for.  And I'm not a jealous type - I feel nothing but happiness for them and their own lives.    But it *hurts*, you know?  Like what the fuck, man.  I've never been the guy who bemoans about fairness or equality being something they're owed.  I'm more than aware that I'm in a better situation than most people.  But sometimes it just feels like life has been thrust onto us, and it's not fucking fair that we have to deal with it.  Consciousness, experience, whatever you want to call it.  It's bizarre that there are just so broad of gaps between people's lives and their experience of them.  Again, I'm not asking for some sort of universe-ordered fairness, but I can certainly be unhappy with the current status of things.    I don't know, I just see my life flowing away around me at this point.  I've overcome any self-hatred a long time ago.  I really do love myself, and in a way that makes all of this so much worse.  I just don't know what I've done wrong to get here.  I mean I *know*, but I don't know.  It just feels super shitty.    And of course the standard reply is that it'll get better (or "it can get better" if they're being a little less optimistic).  But I don't care about later.  I'm not feeling later.  I'm feeling **now**.  This shit sucks **now**.  I want it to stop **now**.  I'm just so tired of waking up every day.
HoboWithAGlock	It'll just be a picture of 53 Kevin Durants.
HoboWithAGlock	Rutgers fans don't *do* excitement.
HoboWithAGlock	> Aphex Twin, not really, maybe 1% of his catalog is hard to listen to  The entire Analord project is pretty bizarre music, IMO.  I'd definitely recommend it to OP if they were interested.
HoboWithAGlock	It's not as great as it seems, tbh.    But I understand what you're wanting.  It sucks.
HoboWithAGlock	My dreams are too abstract at this point for me to experience anything like this, but I did used to get them all the time, and it always sucked.
HoboWithAGlock	Woah, Kevin Durant played for the Thunder at one point?
HoboWithAGlock	It's a real shame, but at the same time I'm super happy for them.    I literally subscribed to h3h3 when they had like 1000 subscribers.  I loved their content so fucking much, and as they began to get big I became super excited for them.  Their content actually only got *better* for awhile.    But eventually, they kinda got wrapped up in generic, boring youtube videos that everyone else does.  And they got a huge community that basically forced them to do boring, uninteresting videos in order to get stable views.  I had to unsubscribe around summer 2016 or so.    I'm really sad to see what they've become, but in the end, I can't be anything but happy for Ethan and Hila.
HoboWithAGlock	It wasn't always.  They fell into the trap of that content, and now they're kinda stuck.
HoboWithAGlock	Hell of a birthday present.
HoboWithAGlock	LeBron: an arena with broken AC
HoboWithAGlock	It's a really great move, and I'm happy to see more people noticing how powerful it can be when Wall uses it properly.    It's actually a shame he isn't a better 3 point shooter, because I've always been of the opinion that his moves in a high PnR screen would give him an amazing amount of space at the arc.  The problem is that he ends up driving or going for a mid-range like 90% of the time because he can't shoot as well from distance.    But it's like the perfect crossover to lead into a high rolling big man, lol.  C'mon, John, just get better at long range shooting already.
HoboWithAGlock	I have no strong feelings about the Suns one way or the other.
HoboWithAGlock	"Millionaire sends shoes to person."    A true humanitarian.
HoboWithAGlock	He better fucking not.
HoboWithAGlock	Rutgers should be higher.    Everyone drinks heavily to forget.  It's the only way.
HoboWithAGlock	I don't.
HoboWithAGlock	I think a lot of people underrate how great of a defender Westbrook can be.   He's garbage in games because he doesn't try at all and focuses his entire efforts on offense. There is 0 argument for his defense in games even being average. It's bad, lol.   But he was one of the best defenders coming out of college. Like easily one of the best in the draft. He 100% has the BBIQ and the athleticism to be a top defender in the league if he cared about it.  And so in this scenario, I think it's somewhat fair to imagine that we'd see a more locked-in defense from Westbrook, simply because it's a completely different type of situation.
HoboWithAGlock	It's astounding how bad the SI list becomes after #9. 
HoboWithAGlock	Assuming Arenas doesn't go though the same career path as before, then I 100% pick him.    That being said, Wallace certainly had the more accomplished career.
HoboWithAGlock	I think you're kinda right, but you're missing the part where he's implying that it's still an issue.    I think he's saying that "5 years is fine assuming you believe that he sentence is just, and if you don't feel the sentence is just, then there is another issue we should be looking at - that of the judicial system and its ability to properly sentence people."    I can see him saying that the "5 years is fine," part, but I think it's a way of creating a argument to discuss, not a point in and of itself.
HoboWithAGlock	Then the discussion should be on how the rehabilitation system has failed society in providing a proper outcome, no?    I think the crux of /u/vtelgeuse's argument is that if we should be angry at anything, it should be at the judicial and penal system for not properly working in a way that creates fullly capable citizens afterwards. And if that *is* the case, then the system needs to have a better accounting of who they release, and society needs to talk about how post-prison restrictions should work.
HoboWithAGlock	I still don't see how this argument would hold water unless Boogie ended up being the Pelicans' 6th man or something, lmao.
HoboWithAGlock	He's underrated by most casual nba watchers because who tf is watching Kings and Pelicans games for fun lol. Add on to that the fact that he's never been to the playoffs (where most people start watching), and you end up with a player that most people only ever hear about. 
HoboWithAGlock	Expect nothing less in a thread about child molestation / rape.   It's a very emotional topic for a lot of people.
HoboWithAGlock	Can you seriously not differentiate an argument for judicial reform and an argument for defending child molestation?    The person is creating their point using the former, not the latter.
HoboWithAGlock	I honestly can't believe anyone would say that Draymond is potentially a better player than Paul George or Jimmy Butler.
HoboWithAGlock	I agree with this list, though you could make an argument that 15-16 Steph Curry *could* be #1, and 13-14 Kevin Durant *could* be #3.    2013 LeBron and 2016 Steph are above and beyond everything else, though.
HoboWithAGlock	That's true. I agree with everything you've said, and it's not like I don't actually understand the argument being made. I do.   But I do wonder how people would perceive other players (like PG or Butler or Boogie, etc) if they were in Dray's position. He's in a spot where he basically can't look bad whatsoever. He's never had to be an offensive star because his team has been stacked with them, and that can hide a lot of the potential faults that we don't see.   Faults that would appear much more obvious had he been the #1 option on a mediocre Indiana or Chicago team, for instance.
HoboWithAGlock	The problem with Wilt is that a lot of his acomplishments *are* indeed exaggerated or fabricated. The 550 lbs. bench press is so obviously fake, and anyone who lifts even semi-seriously could tell you that.   However, he *was* an olympic-level track and field athlete, especially in the high jump and certain running events. He broke several records for his state, and was pursued to compete in the Olympics during and after college. That much is absolutely verified.   And so when people hear the dumb shit like the stuff about his strength (which was insane, but not 550 lbs. bench insane), they tend to just waive everything off as being legend or tall tale. It's a shame, too, because Wilt was a once in a generation athlete, and people downplay it because of the dumb stuff.
HoboWithAGlock	The Smith is actually really terrible for benching, because proper form is not in a straight line.    The only time I use the smith nowadays is for supplemental OHP.  It's actually really nice for it, because you can load up like ~30 lbs. more on the bar and just do short range of motion reps.  I really like it as an occasional burnout exercise.  But it's shit for everything else, mostly.
HoboWithAGlock	I have the same problem, and it's a pain in the ass on heavy sets.    I'm interested in trying your yoga mat solution, but I feel like it'd just kinda slip while you're benching.  Do you not have that problem?
HoboWithAGlock	Yeah, and he has a ring now, so let's not start giving fans any bright ideas.
HoboWithAGlock	They literally say it in the video, lol.
HoboWithAGlock	We are all basketball scholars and historians, here.
HoboWithAGlock	For real. That's the saddest part of all.   I don't know if it's because he's trying to curate an image of himself right now, but he's seems like the least interesting person I've ever seen.
HoboWithAGlock	"You need to get that food to go through smoothly otherwise it becomes a bacteria."    Yeah, I don't know about that one, Phil.
HoboWithAGlock	Napoleon weeps.
HoboWithAGlock	For real.  Please don't do this, or at least give us the option.    It's hard enough identifying things in game by color as is.
HoboWithAGlock	This is borderline worrying when it comes to KD's psyche, lmao.
HoboWithAGlock	My right meniscus weeps at the idea of me growing that tall.
HoboWithAGlock	Thiccest president since Taft, baby.
HoboWithAGlock	Yeah, I was more just implying that if FlightClub has them for that cheap, they're really not rare or expensive right now.
HoboWithAGlock	You can get them on FC for like nothing.  10.5 is on there for $125.
HoboWithAGlock	Who cares
HoboWithAGlock	True, but Klay only needed 9 minutes to do it.
HoboWithAGlock	The generally accepted, westernized, non-Greek pronunciation is "Zehn-uh-fon" with a stress on the first syllable.
HoboWithAGlock	Mr. Peanutbutter is also borderline retarded in a lot of ways.    I find it bizarre how so many people don't bring this up when discussing their relationship.  If *anything*, it should be put into a similar light as the Jenny / Forrest relationship from Forrest Gump.  It's different, of course, but there are a lot of similarities.
HoboWithAGlock	You guys are both missing the point.    The problem isn't about the room or the house or the vacation or anything.    The problem is that Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane are fundamentally incompatible people who are using each other for emotional support without actually building anything foundational for a long-term understanding and love for one another.    *That's* the problem. 
HoboWithAGlock	"I don't wanna live.  **Why** did you save me?!  I *don't* wanna to live!  I don't wanna live."
HoboWithAGlock	Views on their nba youtube highlight videos.
HoboWithAGlock	That's fine, but the whole plotline was shoehorned into the season in order to give Todd something to do.  It felt incredibly artificial, and there was literally no real payoff for everything.  It was just a continuous line of "it's OK, Todd, you're accepted for who you are" over and over.    Like, I don't mind it's inclusion, but at least make it feel natural and thematically important to both his character and to the story as a whole.
HoboWithAGlock	The commentators were talking about tennis with like 6 minutes remaining, lmao.   Everyone wanted to be done with that shitshow of a game.
HoboWithAGlock	The dude straight up lied about a massive financial decision to his boss, lol.    I knew people were gonna be defending him a bit, but there's literally no argument that he was in the right.  (Unless you mean from a writing standpoint, in which case I kinda agree it wasn't what his character deserved.)
HoboWithAGlock	Nah, naked mole rats are also well known for being able to survive oxygen deprivation.
HoboWithAGlock	Bones McKinney with the shot, boi.
HoboWithAGlock	He also keeps a lot of fat in his neck and jaw area, which makes him look fatter than he is.
HoboWithAGlock	>I think this drags up the, "why wasn't he trying?" question. TBH.   More like the "did he literally sell his soul to Satan?" question.
HoboWithAGlock	Malik Rose is always so forgotten when talking about this Spurs run. He did exactly what he needed to do in order to get the Spurs the best possible defensive outcomes. 
HoboWithAGlock	Because the media votes for DPOY, not first team all-defense.   It's the same reason LeBron didn't win in 2013, but Marc Gasol won it while only being second team all-defense. Tim should have won it at least once in his career.
HoboWithAGlock	It was like the most quintessential Rutgers loss, too.  It's really quite beautiful if you learn to appreciate it.
HoboWithAGlock	"Hey it geg."
HoboWithAGlock	That makes more sense. I thought he meant both her and Diane were born in the wrong eras.
HoboWithAGlock	I tend to agree.  I think the show's political commentary has always been weaker than it's other social criticisms or satirical outlooks.    The reason people are more opinionated on it now is because half of season 4 focused on it directly.
HoboWithAGlock	Thank you so much for this comment.  I hate when people start talking about how they hate a specific character for whatever reason.    The point of Bojack Horseman (the show) is that *everyone*, and I mean ***everyone*** has flaws.  Everyone is fucked up.  Everyone has shit that changed them.  That affected them.  That made them who they were.   The truth is that our relationships with other people is all we have when it comes to creating the person we want to be today.    That's what this show is about.  No one is a "bad" person.  Everything has a cause.  And while we should never be OK with people giving in to their issues and fucking over others;  We should always at least *try* to understand them.
HoboWithAGlock	Beatrice would have literally gone to jail for child abuse if this show was real, lmao.  
HoboWithAGlock	It's not really foreshadowing.  It's them using previous themes and motifs in later seasons and episodes correspondingly.
HoboWithAGlock	"JT is regressing as a passer."    Welp
HoboWithAGlock	Boy I can't wait for 75 yards of passing offense by Oklahoma followed by a turnover bailing out our secondary.
HoboWithAGlock	C'mon guys. Jesus.
HoboWithAGlock	Welp. We got bailed out again, lmao.
HoboWithAGlock	It's been a rough day.
HoboWithAGlock	It was part of Texas, but it was above the line that the US decided would separate slave and free states.   Texas wanted to be entered as a slave state, so they gave up that land, which was eventually subsumed into the Oklahoma territory. When Oklahoma became a state, it remained part of their boundary.
HoboWithAGlock	Our pass d is embarssing.
HoboWithAGlock	She's basically the straight-man of the show, for the most part.  She's by far the most normal, aside from her semi-workaholic nature.    Which is why it's always so hard to see bad shit happen to her.
HoboWithAGlock	Our secondary is such a *fucking* joke.
HoboWithAGlock	This game is a fucking joke
HoboWithAGlock	Our offensive schemes somehow look *worse* now than they did under Tim "Jet Sweep" Beck.  I can't believe it.
HoboWithAGlock	Times like this almost make you miss the classic Ohio State red zone plan of jet sweep x3.
HoboWithAGlock	How is this even a discussion.
HoboWithAGlock	"We gotta play much better."    Yeah no kidding, Urban.
HoboWithAGlock	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Panhandle
HoboWithAGlock	Are you kidding me.
HoboWithAGlock	> Diane, just born in the wrong era.   But wait, what?  Diane isn't really born in the wrong era.  Several episodes have been dedicated to her opinions and projects.  She's been more than able to push her own beliefs during sub-plots of the show.    Beatrice lived in an era where wives could be lobotomized because their husbands told the doctor to do it.
HoboWithAGlock	No, but they *were* forced by their families to have it. There was just as little personal choice on their end, unfortunately.
HoboWithAGlock	Alcohol is the only hug I need tonight.    But thank you.
HoboWithAGlock	Weak PI. Give me a break.
HoboWithAGlock	Urban's gonna yell at them until they become one, anyway.
HoboWithAGlock	I wouldn't even call it a defensive battle. Our D line has been great, but the only reason we're not losing is because OU keeps getting fucking up at the end of their offensive possessions.
HoboWithAGlock	Lmao
HoboWithAGlock	Who is our backup QB this year?
HoboWithAGlock	Obvious.   Thank you, refs.
HoboWithAGlock	These refs lol
HoboWithAGlock	Yeah, that sounds like Rutgers to me.
HoboWithAGlock	True, but it makes it so much easier to root for and watch both of my teams.
Motivation_Man	I feel like most people are walking around depressed everyday and have no idea | Maybe it's (ironically) being depressed that's making me think this way, but is it just me that thinks it's a problem with the world? Like take a fucking look around man. Take a good look at the people you know, the people you encounter everyday. I bet behind the façade you can see the signs of depression. That kind of look that says 'dude I'm trying but inside I feel like a fucking wreck'. Most people I know joke about how shitty their lives are and how depressed they feel and shit. They've accepted that life's fucking insanely hard. It's got to the stage where everyone's so scared of how they feel we just have to make any attempt we can to laugh it off.  Sure, you get the successful, happy and content people. But they seem, to me at least, few and far between. More people seem far from happy with their lives. I've found that a lot of people prefer to be friends with/talk to people who aren't the successful, happy and content type because it's easier to understand. People are jealous that they can't feel like that.  I don't know if this is making sense. I guess what I mean is I feel there's loads of people walking around every fucking day, depressed as shit, and having no idea. If I make a joke about how fucking depressed I feel, or like a joke about suicide, 9 times out of 10 it will get a laugh. A genuine, understanding laugh that's like 'yeah man, I know how you feel'. And that is fucked up. Sincerely fucked up. I genuinely think my friends are as depressed as me and just hide it behind jokes we make.  It's just insane to me. I feel like if people were more open we might be able to make some progress and people could realise just how bad things are in their heads, but instead we all try ignore it like a defence mechanism. And that's the worst shit we can do. It just makes me feel awful that there's potentially so many people feeling as bad, or way worse than me, and they might never get better. Fucking terrifying.
Motivation_Man	I had this man. There's this girl in my life who I've had a massive thing for for a long time. We're good friends, but she has a boyfriend. I accepted a while back I'll never be with her, and hell, I don't even know if I'm actually capable of being that close with someone without fucking it up/scaring them off. Anyway, I had a dream once where we were dating and it all just seemed so real. I remember we'd went on a date, went back to her's and I fell asleep. Next thing I know I wake up with her cuddled up to me, and I remember thinking that for the first time in a long time I felt genuinely, completely happy and content.  Then of course I woke up. And had to sit and think about shit for a while before I could drag my sorry ass out of bed. It sucks man, maybe one day we'll have one of these moments and won't wake up.
Motivation_Man	[S4 Spoilers] The use of the 'F Bomb' this season was the best so far | Every time until now when we hear that F Bomb drop its because BoJack had fucked up insanely bad somehow. It comes from people he cares about who just can't stand being around him anymore because of how self-destructive he's getting. So when BoJack drops the F Bomb this season, indirectly to his mom who doesn't even get to hear it, it came out of nowhere, and felt kind of unsatisfying. We already know how much he hates his mom, why bother?  Then later on in that amazing moment where BoJack comforts his mom, it all makes sense. We know exactly what he wants to say to her face. We know him saying that to her in the one moment she recognises him would fuck her up even more. The BoJack of earlier seasons would have told his mom 'fuck you' without a second thought. He would only care about the moment of narcissistic relief he gets from finally just saying it to her when it would hurt most.   But he doesn't do it. And that's the beauty. Up until now the F Bomb's been used to show how BoJack's become more and more fucked up. But this time it shows how much he's grown. He's finally able to put someone else's feelings before his own. We see him try (and fail a little) at this with his attempts to care for Hollyhock too. And that's what makes him able to be a good brother to her at the very end, and what gives him that moment of happiness he's been chasing for 4 seasons now. It's amazingly written.
Motivation_Man	He tells Hollyhock that after they put on the Horsin' Around episode for his mom and she realises who he is, he's gonna tell her 'fuck you mom'. He was planning on using the moment she realises him to drag her down even further and make himself feel good, but instead he comforts her. 
Motivation_Man	[Spoilers] Watching the new season of BoJack Horseman has surprisingly gave me some much needed hope | It sounds weird that a show about a cartoon horse would be the thing to give me any sort of hope. But fuck that season really did. BoJack's a horribly fucked up person. He's abandoned friends who needed him, acted only in his self interests, tried to have sex with his friend's barely legal daughter, hell he's arguably directly responsible for the person closest to being his daughter's spiralling out of control due to drugs and meeting a tragic fate. He's a massive fuck up, he's an asshole, but he's also horribly depressed. He wants to believe he's a good person deep down, regardless of all the shit he does.  He fucks up over and over even when people give him good advice. But now he's started to grow. He's started putting the feelings of others before his own, started to realise the faults he has and how he should deal with them. He's started letting people in rather than pushing them away. He gives his dementia ridden mother who made his life hell some comfort in her rare moment of clarity, rather than repeating that cycle of hate. He does his best to be a father to Hollyhock who arrives at his door claiming to be his daughter. And when it turns out she's his sister instead, that kindness results in a relationship of mutual love and respect. He finally has some hope, something to live for beyond alcohol, drugs, meaningless sex.  It's just that if somebody as fucked up as BoJack is can start to change and make improvements in their life, and just maybe become that 'good person' deep down, hell, can't I too? I might be depressed, I might have faults, but we all deserve to be loved man. There's got to be some hope for all of us, right? Maybe it does get a little easier everyday if you do work at it everyday.
Motivation_Man	Man thanks for writing this. For years I've wondered if I'm depressed. I mean I suppose I knew deep down. But the thought of my baseline beings near happy is just alien to me now. I know at one point it was, but I just thought growing up took that away. I didn't realise how bad it was. I've used the whole 'I can be happy sometimes (usually drunk or something), so I can't be THAT bad' defense for so long. Anyway, thanks. Now I can see how bad it is.
Motivation_Man	I'll check out the lectures at some point for sure. Thanks for the help!
Motivation_Man	I mean not anymore than the average person who'd get along just fine. I've tried the NoFap thing before a few years back and honestly it didn't change a difference. I don't really have a masturbation problem, if anything in the last couple of years I have less of an urge to masturbate than I even have.
Motivation_Man	I haven't actually. Maybe I should. I just assumed it must be depression or something, but maybe there is a further underlying cause.
Motivation_Man	Yeah I'm pretty sure it's depression. Any change in my attitude usually comes really late at night, with all signs of the slight motivation I had gone the next morning and not to be seen for the rest of the day. I can't escape it. Maybe I should see a doctor, but honestly that itself seems insanely daunting.
Motivation_Man	I feel constantly exhausted to the point where getting through the day is a struggle | I'm fed up of feeling this way man. I feel like a fucking husk. I used to have so much energy when I was younger. I'm only 19, I should be full of life and ready to take on the world. Instead I feel constantly tired and mentally drained even though I do nothing all day apart from watch TV. Anything else I genuinely need to nap to recover because it takes its toll. Today I went for a fucking haircut after sleeping until 2pm. A twenty minute walk. And after I got back I slept until dinner.  Unless it's work, college, or getting drunk/high with friends at the weekend, I'm not gonna leave my house without some major effort. Hell, I'll find any excuse to get out of work and college. I've phoned in 'sick' to work multiple times when I'm just too drained to go in, and god knows how many lectures I skipped in the last year. Even going out with friends takes effort, even if it takes my mind off things when I make it out. I wish I could be one of those people who actively improve their life everyday, but I just can't see how I could. Hell, it's my mom's birthday in 2 days and I'm not even going out for dinner with her. I told her and my dad to enjoy it without me, but truth is I just can't be bothered with it. That's fucking horrible to admit.  I feel like a lazy piece of shit. I sit and wonder why shit hasn't happened for me; why I have no passion, no girlfriend, no real drive to get out of bed. It's like a chicken and egg situation. I can't tell if having nothing to get out of bed for was caused by being depressed and lazy, or having nothing to get out of bed for caused me to become this way. Either way,  just getting by day to day now is fucking exhausting and it's such a god damn struggle.

Motivation_Man	This show's fucking beautiful man. After all the shit that's happened to BoJack, all the shit he's caused, this season we've seen him start to break the cycle of despair that his family's brought on each other. That moment of kindness with his mother. His attempts to look after Hollyhock, even if it didn't go as planned. That ending just feels so earned. BoJack's never really had a true family. He didn't have eight dads, just a pair of very flawed parents. He pushes away those who care for him because he never had that unconditional love. But now he has a chance. He has a sibling. It's just so touching. I swear when I heard Hollyhock say 'I've never had a brother' it really got to me deep down. Sure, BoJack's fucked up, but to some extent, everyone is. Beatrice was fucked. PC spiralled out of control a little. Mr PB and Diane's relationship is flawed and they fuck up a lot. But like Mr PB said, everyone deserves to be loved. I think that's what this season really showed. The reason most people end up so fucked up is simply from a lack of that love in some shape or form, BoJack having a chance at something close to it really is something special.

The reason most people end up so fucked up is simply from a lack of that love in some shape or form, BoJack having a chance at something close to it really is something special.  I'm hoping next season we see how BoJack can be a positive force to those he cares for. Instead of fucking things up, he actually reaches out and helps them. God knows some of his friends are in need of someone who understands. And who better to understand people's darkest shit than BoJack?
Motivation_Man	Thanks for the advice. I do try to some some stuff to take my mind off things. I realise I made it ought like I never leave my room, but that really only covers my spare time. I go to college, I have a job. I go out at the weekends with friends, usually all weekend, which probably isn't healthy but sure as hell takes my mind off shit for a bit.  But still I feel empty. I don't know what life I want, but I know this isn't it. It just feels so meaningless. I just spend my week doing shit I don't want to do, just to numb myself at the weekend and spend the rest of my free time watching TV. I don't enjoy my college course. My job is shitty, but I need money. It's a hollow cycle. It's searching for some meaning in all this shit that makes me so desperate for some connection, e.g. with this girl.   I don't know man. I agree life is beautiful, or at least there are moments. There's times I've felt completely content through all this shit. Sitting with friends without a care, talking to this girl, going on some family vacation, whatever it is. Those moments are what I hold on to when I feel like shit. I have hope that things will get better, I really do, I just have no fucking idea how to get there.
Motivation_Man	I get the whole trying to work the experience into something. I've tried to just see where life takes me. I go to college, I've got a job, I go out at the weekends. I do shit that comes my way, but it feels like I'm just kind of drifting through, you know? I'm not doing anything that I feel I truly want to deep down.  And nah I haven't told her. She has a boyfriend and I'm not out to cause drama. I think on some level she knows though. I don't know how to describe it, sometimes when a flirty joke goes too far, or her boyfriend comes up, or just some little look between us happens or sometning. I think it's obvious to both of us what's going on here. We used to talk every single day before she started dating, now it's only once every few days really. I think we both kind of realised if she's in a relationship it's best if there's some distance between us, even if we never acknowledged it out loud.
Motivation_Man	I feel kind of depressed and lonely cause I don't have any connection, but that's also what stops me having connection in the first place | It's weird how I can like know the exact cycle I'm stuck in and feel so powerless to stop it. I'm only 19 and as it stands I can see myself going through this shit over and over until I'm old and alone. I've felt depressed for a few years now. For the longest time I thought I was just your regular angsty, moody teenager. But as time's went on I've realised there's a definite hole in me. Some kind of loneliness that doesn't go away no matter how many people around me seem to be there for me. It makes me feel like I have nothing fundamentally to get out of bed for. I have no aims, no goals, no hopes and no dreams. I'm just drifting through my life. My family can't fix it, my friends can't fix it, no romantic interest can fix it.  I'm perpetually hoping for some close connection because of this. The contradiction in me comes when i seem to subconsciously push away everyone. My family could probably help, but I barely speak to them, and instead sit in my room all day. Sometimes I just can't be bothered talking to them and come across like a little asshole, arguing over the smallest shit. My friends are typical guys; we make fun of each other and joke about our insecurities. It's kind of comforting; if you can joke about being depressed, you never have to confront it. Hell, I don't think they'd know my jokes are serious. And even if I wanted to tell them, I'm kind of an enigma to everyone. I keep everyone at arm's length and don't let anyone in. Even though it's all I want.  The aspect of my life this seems to impact most is my romantic life. I've never had a girlfriend, or even had a girl be into me. Not really. A guy like me, so deeply insecure and desperate for someone to help drag me out this shit, doesn't have ladies lining up. Every now and then though, something kind of magical happens. I feel that connection with someone. It's only happened twice. Having someone that actually cares. The minute I know a girl cares about me (not romantically, just as a friend), I get so fucking attached. That feeling like someone might ACTUALLY get me and be able to help somehow. I know deep down that's bullshit, but it doesn't stop me falling.   And that shit hurts me the worst. I spend a lot of my time right now hopelessly idealising and wishing I was with my best friend who I'm head over heels for. It's never gonna happen though. She's got a boyfriend, she's happy, she's got goals and shit. She's got a path in life, and I'm a fucking mess. Nobody wants to love someone who doesn't love themselves. This girl's probably the person who shows the most genuine interest in just knowing me that I can think of. It means the world to me, but at the same time being around her and thinking of her fucking hurts. Cause I know that what I feel for her is just a symptom of a bigger problem; me clinging to the one person that makes me feel, for the time that I'm around her, not lonely. Just content.  But how do I stop it? I know the problem is one with me ultimately. It's a vicious cycle. I find myself hopelessly reaching for a connection like that cause I'm fundamentally lonely and depressed. But because of that loneliness and depression I'll never have that connection in the first place. But what's the fix here? Being with her won't fix it. It has to be me. But what can I fix in myself that changes what feels like a fundamentally human flaw; wanting to be loved? There can't be a cure for feeling lonely and unloved. I can't think of something I can do to fix that. The common advice is learning to love yourself and having some other shit to focus on, like an aspiration or passion. But the fact is I don't love myself all that much and the only thing I feel passionate about and want is a girl I'll never have.   I don't know man. I just feel fundamentally broken and while I feel like this one person will fix me, I know both that I'll never be with her and even if I was, it wouldn't fix me. But I can't change how I feel, and that's hard to live with.  **TL;DR:** Want close connection because I'm depressed, but that's the very thing that makes it so hard. Hits me hard romantically most; currently head over heels for my best friend who will never like me back. I know being with her won't make me feel better, but it still makes me feel like utter shit regardless. Don't know how to fix myself.

Motivation_Man	Thanks. I know it's probably the best decision, but I just think it will be so hard to get help. I wish it was easier. I don't want anyone to know this is how I feel. It shouldn't, but having to admit it feels deeply embarrassing. I wish I didn't have to feel like this and I could just feel normal on my own without all this added effort haha. I'll definitely give therapy more thought at the very least, because up until now I've just brushed it off.

Motivation_Man	I don't agree with your first part. I'm not some like recluse. I get plenty of social interaction. I go to work where people talk to me and joke around all the time. I have college starting back soon. I usually spend all weekend with my friends and a massive group of girls we know. Nobody would have the slightest idea I'm depressed. I always feel like I'm pretending around them if that makes any sense. Making jokes and being kind of a little clown. With her I'm not. That's the only way I can explain it. She gets who I am deeper than that. It's why we were friends in the first place.  And yeah I mean I'm sure my parents would be supportive but also insanely worried. Like fuck. They've been overprotective most of my life. I love them, but I know if I tell them they'll think it's something they did, or whatever else and try keep tabs on me all the time and worry worry worry. They'll mean well, but I don't want that. I don't know, I don't want to burden anyone, even though I know I have a problem.
Motivation_Man	See I agree completely. I even mentioned it. I dont think she's perfect, but she's the only person who's ever shown interest beyond just whoever I am on the surface. I know she won't fix me, nobody will, but I don't even know what to talk about if I went to therapy. I'm stuck in my house so much all week that if I did go, my parents would know something's up. Telling them would be a big drama. I don't want to make some big deal out of this and upset those around me just because I feel lonely and cling to whoever shows me some attention.

Motivation_Man	Yeah it's hard not to notice it. It's happened to me before too, I just let it slide though.
Motivation_Man	A few of my friends just followed the girl I like at the same time | So I was drunk last night and ended up telling one of my friends about this girl I like. He went on to tell my other friends and they all talked about it this morning. About three or four of them followed her at the same time. We are good friends so I can imagine her just laughing about it but fuck man how weird does that seem. It's obvious I've talked about her or something to them. I have no idea what I'll say if she asks me about it, and even if she doesn't ask shit might be awkward. Don't really know if I should act like nothing happened or have some bullshit explanation ready.
Motivation_Man	I think she'd definitely notice because she accepted them all right away and she knows these guys are all my friends. I don't know whether she'd bring it up though. And I would tell her why it happened, but she has a boyfriend so that would just cause drama.
Motivation_Man	What YouTube video has had the largest impact on you? | 
Motivation_Man	The only thing I can come up with is the fact that we went to a party together the other day. I could just say my friends asked who went and her name came up or something.  
Motivation_Man	I hope so lmao
Motivation_Man	For me it's a toss up between [How We Met At The Holocaust Museum](http://youtu.be/Ec1syKOdlwo) by h3h3 or [And Nothing Can Ever Ruin This](http://youtu.be/tJ7LdrAqL0Y) by exurb1a. The first because having that one moment of bravery in the midst of going through some shit really spoke to me, and the second cause damn it's so damn relatable it kind of hurts.
Motivation_Man	I actually have distanced myself a little. We used to message each other like everyday, but that stopped when she stared dating this guy. Now it's like a few times a week or whatever. I think we both kind of realised we need some distance, but just never said it out loud. We're still on great terms though. She actually keeps trying to get me to go do shit with her all the time, this party I mentioned was just the first time it actually happened.
Motivation_Man	Yeah that's what I've been doing so far. When I'm around her all other shit goes out my mind and I just feel genuinely happy, but it's after it I always start thinking about how I want more and it ends up getting to me. We actually used to message each other like everyday but toned it down when she started dating this guy. I think we kind of mutually realised it would be best if there was some distance between us or whatever.
Motivation_Man	The thing is about me is that if I can be pretty quiet sometimes. I'll still crack jokes but it will kind of be on the down low most of the time. If people aren't really paying attention they won't really pick up on what I said, but she always does. It's the same thing with my close friends.   I mean I don't know if there are really any 'red flags'. Apart from some flirting before she was in a relationship there's never been anything to tell me she's trying to lead me on or take advantage or whatever. I think she just genuinely enjoys being around me. Or I'd hope so. You never really know if anyone has ulterior motives to talk to you or whatever, but sometimes you just have to trust they don't I suppose.
Motivation_Man	I mean it's not as if she's sat down and told me so I'd only be guessing. I doubt she'd know all the shit I like about her. She just notices the little things other people don't. Like if I make a joke nobody else laughs at she'll find it hilarious, she compliments shit I wear, just little things. It just feels like she actually pays full attention to me while others might brush things off if that makes sense. She has told me before how she'd quit her job if I left and how much she enioys being around me and stuff. 
Motivation_Man	Lmao thanks for the help
Motivation_Man	I'm insanely into a good coworker friend; more than any girl I've known. I'll probably never be with her through and it fucks me up | This post will sound insanely stupid, but it reas written when I was drunk and I felt like I had to get some shit off my chest. I always knew I liked this girl I work with. It built up slowly, but it's grown and grown and now I'm into her a hell of a lot. We just are on the same wavelength for so much shit. I hate exaggerating and idealising or whatever, but at times it feel like Jim and Pam in The Office. We can share one look st each other and know exactly what the other is thinking, and often burst out laughing.  But she has a boyfriend. I know deep down I'm not gonna be with her while that's going on. But part of me wants to be with her so bad man. Tonight I went to a party with her and some work colleagues and honestly every time I was near her was fucking magic. She compliments me on shit other people don't notice or find annoying. She genuinely cares about me, which is more than can be said for a lot of people. It's just good to feel appreciated by someone you like man. Like if she has an option of who to talk to or sit with or whatever nine times out of ten she'll choose me. And that honestly means the world. She's naturally flirty, but with me it's kinda different. She doesn't obviously flirt, she kinda does it more subtly if that makes sense. Like with other guys it's obvious when she's having a flirty joke, but with me it's more ambiguous and kind of hidden off, as if she feels shy about it.  I don't really know why I wrote this. In all honesty I'm still a little drunk. I watched guys from work get with random girls they've never met and try set me up too, and I couldn't do it. I couldn't hook up with some random girl because all I could think of was her. It's honestly fucking awful cause shit man, she's in a relationship. I shouldn't feel this way towards a good friend. But she's honestly amazing and I can't get enough of her. It's insane. I've never, ever felt this way about anyone in my life. I've had crushes, but not this shit. Nobody prepared me for feeling this way.   I dunno. I know it's not gonna happen but being around her is often the highlight of my week, even in my shitty job. Being around her at a party with alcohol involved made me realise just how deep it went though. If I wasn't talking to her, I was desperate to find a way to. It sounds so cringy and stupid, but I've fallen head over heels for this girl and I have no idea how I'm ever gonna get over it. She's not perfect. She's judgemental, moody, closed off at times and hard to get to know.  But I know her and fuck. It makes up for it all. Today at this party, just talking shit with her and instinctively laughing at shit around us, like it's one big inside joke, I genuinely could have died happy man. That sounds fucking pathetic, but it's true.   It feels like so much more than a stupid crush. Usually I crush on girls I don't really know and idealise her. But I really, really do know her, and every little thing I find out makes me like her even more. She's just the best person to be around. And as it stands I can't be with her. And it's so fucking painful man. All I get to live with is little hilarious and warm moments with a girl who sees me as a very good friend. I can't tell whether I love it or not. And I don't want this to sound like some 'friendzone' bullshit, cause honestly that shit's fucking stupid and I can't change who she likes, but it is still hard to be a friend when feeling this way regardless. I do my best, but man it tears me up. My fault for not taking a chance sooner though I suppose.  **TL;DR:** Insanely into coworker friend who has a boyfriend. We had a party together and it was fucking amazing. I felt like I could talk to her for the rest of my life and not get bored. Feel pathetic, but had to rant about how I feel.

Motivation_Man	I've noticed my mom acting a bit weird recently, and I think it might have something to do with meds she takes | So my mom's been on painkillers for quite a while now. She works a hard job where she's constantly on the go and does long ass shifts, so she has a lot of back and leg pain. She's had like repetitive strain injuries and stuff. I think she also gets some like really severe menstrual cramps too that she's took stuff for. Anyway, I don't know the exact details of what she's prescribed, I just know she takes something before bed most nights.  I've heard my dad discuss with her before about whether she still needs them, but she insists she does. Usually I don't notice much change in her. Her moods can be a bit off sometimes. Like as if she's acting overly happy, almost to the point where I think she's faking it and is angry or something deep down. I dunno if that's makes sense. Just sort of like she's happy outwardly but also on edge.  Anyway, it's not usually a big deal, or something I think about at all, but the last couple of weeks or so I've noticed like an hour or two before bed if I talk to her her speech is often slurred. She blames it on having fallen asleep, but it's definitely more than that. She's my mom; I know what she sounds like when she's just woke up. This isn't that. Tonight was particularly bad; her speech was so slurred that it progressively got nigh on incomprehensible. It's kinda scary. My dad even mentioned it to her, and she just told him she's tired. But it can't just be that. I'm pretty sure it's something to do do with the meds. I've also noticed that while she used to go to bed around when I do, she'll often stay up about 20 minutes after everyone else is in bed and fuck around in the kitchen. Maybe taking extra meds or something? I don't want to accuse her of anything, and hell I may be well off the mark. It might just be ordinary side effects of shit she's on, but I'm not sure and it worries me a little cause it seems to be getting more noticeable. I don't even know if she realises how she gets. Any advice?  **TL;DR:** Mom has been on meds for back and leg pain. Noticed her speech getting slurred recently and she makes excuses for it that are obviously not the truth. What do I do?

It might just be ordinary side effects of shit she's on, but I'm not sure and it worries me a little cause it seems to be getting more noticeable. I don't even know if she realises how she gets. Any advice?  **TL;DR:** Mom has been on meds for back and leg pain. Noticed her speech getting slurred recently and she makes excuses for it that are obviously not the truth. What do I do? 
Motivation_Man	Yeah man I done a bit of research and I kind of thought that too. I don't know how to really handle that though. Like is there really anything I can do? 
Motivation_Man	I [19 M] have noticed my mom [48 F] acting weird recently, and I think it may have to do with meds she's taking. | So my mom's been on painkillers for quite a while now. She works a hard job where she's constantly on the go and does long ass shifts, so she has a lot of back and leg pain. She's had like repetitive strain injuries and stuff. I think she also gets some like really severe menstrual cramps too that she's took stuff for. Anyway, I don't know the exact details of what she's prescribed, I just know she takes something before bed most nights.  I've heard my dad discuss with her before about whether she still needs them, but she insists she does. Usually I don't notice much change in her. Her moods can be a bit off sometimes. Like as if she's acting overly happy, almost to the point where I think she's faking it and is angry or something deep down. I dunno if that's makes sense. Just sort of like she's happy outwardly but also on edge.  Anyway, it's not usually a big deal, or something I think about at all, but the last couple of weeks or so I've noticed like an hour or two before bed if I talk to her her speech is often slurred. She blames it on having fallen asleep, but it's definitely more than that. She's my mom; I know what she sounds like when she's just woke up. This isn't that. Tonight was particularly bad; her speech was so slurred that it progressively got nigh on incomprehensible. It's kinda scary. My dad even mentioned it to her, and she just told him she's tired. But it can't just be that. I'm pretty sure it's something to do do with the meds. I've also noticed that while she used to go to bed around when I do, she'll often stay up about 20 minutes after everyone else is in bed and fuck around in the kitchen. Maybe taking extra meds or something? I don't want to accuse her of anything, and hell I may be well off the mark. It might just be ordinary side effects of shit she's on, but I'm not sure and it worries me a little cause it seems to be getting more noticeable. I don't even know if she realises how she gets. Any advice?  **TL;DR:** Mom has been on meds for back and leg pain. Noticed her speech getting slurred recently and she makes excuses for it that are obviously not the truth. What do I do? 
Motivation_Man	I honestly don't want to, she's a great girl and if I find out she's genuinely into me I'll tread very carefully. She doesn't deserve to get hurt at all.
Motivation_Man	Going for a drive with my friends tonight was the best I've felt in months | My friends always say I should come out more during the week, since the only time I see them is to get drunk at the weekend, but most of the time I'm too depressed or tired to move out my bed and stop watching TV. Today I feel oddly energetic though, for once, so I decided fuck it. My friends asked if I wanted to go out for a drive with them. We drove about into the night for about 4 hours, just driving around the city and shit. We got out, went a walk and laughed at all the drunk people going into clubs and shit. Honestly it was amazing. Sitting there in the car, driving in the night with the Stars above you, some good music on, surrounded by your friends who are all having a laugh, for a little while everything seems like it could be okay. Like anything's possible. It's a weird feeling. It's those little moments I think you need to hold on to when you go through this shit, you know? The little moments you realise it's not 100% bad. That you get out your head and realise there's a whole world of shit to do out there and things you can experience. Don't get me wrong, tomorrow I may feel like utter shit and want to just sleep the day away and talk to nobody, but at least I have this to remember. 
Motivation_Man	Yeah man exactly. Like you're just driving into the unknown, no idea where the hell you'll end up or what you'll see. But you're just excited to be doing it. Kinda makes you feel like a kid again.
Motivation_Man	It's weird cause there's some nights where I do kind of find her attractive and some where I just don't. I think I am kind of hung up on it, and I don't want to lead her on while I'm unsure. I feel like I'm maybe kind of into her a little, but it's hard to tell. Like I enjoy talking to her a lot and it does make my night a little better if she's there. But I dunno. I'm not gonna make any bold moves while I'm unsure though.
Motivation_Man	I don't know how I feel about this girl who flirts with me every weekend | I don't know how I feel about this girl I know. We're sort of friends I suppose. The group of guys I'm friends with usually ends up going with them same group of girls every weekend, but we don't talk all that much during the week. We're just kind of weekend buddies if that makes sense. One of these girls I kind of clicked with right away. Not romantically, we just have really similar senses of humour and so we'll have a good time together. A lot of the time if there's a big group of us one of us will crack a joke and the other one will be the only person to get it. We're just kinda on the same wavelength.  Anyway, this didn't go unnoticed, and everyone started hitting us with the 'you two were made for each other' bullshit. Even though I don't really find her attractive, we kind of just played into the joke for a laugh, and would pretend to act like a couple when we were out, pretending to get jealous if the other was flirting with someone else, etc.   The thing is, it seems like something might be going on beyond that. A couple of times when we've been out it seems like there's been those silent moments where you don't know whether you're gonna kiss or not. Sometimes the flirting is pretty damn heavy and I'd say crosses the joke line, but it's always hard to tell cause we've joked for so long about it all. Sometimes it's unmistakable though. She once drunkedly messaged me when I stayed in one weekend begging me to come out. She kept asking over and over, and she told me she'd have sex with me if I did. I just told her she's mega drunk and that she'll just have to have fun without me. The next day she messaged me apologising for anything embarrassing she said, and I just told her not to worry about it. On the other hand, she has told me before when it's just her and me that she wants me to know it is all a joke, but I don't know if she's just saying that to make sure there's no awkwardness or whatever.  Typing that out it seems like there's something there, but honestly I dunno what to think. I think there's definitely something on her side. Her friends even told me she talks about me all the time and shit. Like I dunno what to think. I mean I like her as a friend. I just don't know if I find her like sexually attractive. Sometimes when I'm really drunk then yeah I do, but that's not the best judgement. I mean she's one of the funniest girls I know, and if I see her flirting with another guy there is a tiny bit of jealousy in me. But I don't know if I'm like really attracted to her. Like we only ever talk when we're out drunk with friends, we have talked sober a few times but it's hard to tell whether the kind of weird chemistry is just some drunk weekend thing. It's weird, I really don't know how I feel, and I also wonder whether I just feel this way cause EVERYONE has repeatedly suggested it. I don't really know how best to handle it.  **TL;DR:** Girl I'm kind of friends with jokingly flirts with me a shit ton, but we only see each other on drunk nights out. Sometimes it's obvious she has some sort of thing for me, but I don't know if I'm attracted to her as well. Don't know how best to handle it all.

Motivation_Man	I don't really know what I want either, I just kind of wanted to rant and see if anyone had been in a similar situation and had some advice. I think talking to her about it at some point would be a good idea.

Motivation_Man	She's never like arranged a get together, but there's like an occasional snapchat or two some weeks. There was one time I was out and I decided to message her (she stayed in), and she seemed desperate to keep the conversation going.   Yeah I think cutting back on it is a good idea. It's weird cause we've been running with this joke for so long, but it will let me figure out what I feel I suppose.

Motivation_Man	[MAIN SPOILERS] Sansa is definitely conflicted. Here's why I believe she's going to make the correct choice | Sansa's going to be faced with a choice, and I feel she'll make the right one. Her family's survival or power.  I love Sansa's character, I think she has a ton of depth that people don't give her credit for. Most this season have simply saw her questioning Jon'a decisions and assumed she's gonna try over throw him or something because of a lust for power. But it's much more than that.  Sansa has saw how the game is played. She's witnessed Ned getting himself killed by making rash decisions. Same with countless others in King's Landing. She knows how the South operate, and she's merely trying to make sure Jon understands it too. Questioning the KITN also isn't as bad as people make out. Robb's decisions were second guessed by his advisors during meetings many times (the 'your meat is bloody tough' scene comes to mind), but nobody was planning to overthrow him. In the North people seem to feel free to just speak their mind.  Anyway, for the first time Sansa finally has some power. Arya rightly pointed out she's enjoying it, and perhaps would like to keep some power. I mean, can you blame a girl who's been what she's through? That power is the very thing giving her her own safety back. She trusts only herself fully; Sansa wants to make sure she doesn't end up being a victim ever again. It's this temptation and fear of letting the power go that's actually the key conflict her character has to deal with now. Has her time around figures like Littlefinger and Cersei turned her into someone who clings to power, no matter the cost? Or is she able to bravely look past the promise of power to outplay her enemies, and ensure her family survives the coming war?  As has been mentioned in the show, Sansa's very smart, and she's starting to show it. It's clear Littlefinger intends for her to rule the North, and for him to be by her side. Littlefinger is going to try to tempt her. He clearly wants to turn Sansa against her siblings, and them against her. I think people make the same mistake Littlefinger is making though. Namely, assuming Sansa will choose power, and the safety it gives her, over her family. I think Sansa's development has led to the point that she'll see right through Littlefinger, and with a little game playing, be able to stop his plans, maybe even with Arya's help.  The problem with many people who play the Game of Thrones is they try to gain too much power. I think Sansa Stark has developed to be the ultimate game player through sheer will; first character who's within touching distance of that power, and could easily choose it, and although she may even be a little tempted by it, I think that she will ultimately be able to outplay her enemies by refusing it. Littlefinger, Cersei, Tyrion, hell even Varys are all excellent game players, but they all share a weakness of wanting too much power. They can't understand how it could be turned down. They enjoy the game. Sansa doesn't. She's been its victim for years. She's been a pawn for so long, trying to just keep going step by step. She's been trapped in the game, forced to keep going. But we all know what happens when the pawn manages to get to the end of the board. Sansa's going to become better than them simply by realising that the power means nothing to her when compared with her family's survival. That's her arc, from whiny clueless victim to the ultimate game player. It's been growing so slowly, but she is finally going to have her big moment.
Motivation_Man	I have no idea how I forgot about that line. It sums up her whole progression perfectly. She knows the importance of her family; she's had enough of having to be the Lone Wolf. She wants to make sure the pack is together.
Motivation_Man	I think Sansa and Arya are too smart now to fall for that shit. A simple conversation between them will clear it up. Like I said, Sansa's whole character from the beginning wanted power, the fairy tale royalty experience. It goes against her progression to choose that over her family, after all the shit she's seen and what she knows is still to come. I don't think Sansa is necessarily scared of Arya either; just a sad and shocked that the world has forced her sister to become this brutal killer.
Motivation_Man	The difference between Ned and Sansa is that Sansa knows how the game's played. She's learned from the best for years, observing all the shit that's went down in King's Landing. She might not want to play, but she HAS to. Nobody else in House Stark understands how it all works. If you want to get into it she's kind of playing an anti-game; she's not trying to gain more power for herself, but rather trying to block Littlefinger's power grab. If she was quitting the game she'd just let him get rid of Jon and have Arya killed. She's obviously not going to let that happen. Hence, she has to play, but she won't be doing to it to be Lady of Winterfell. She'll be doing it to protect her family. Therefore, refusing the allure of power but in essence, continuing to 'play the game' in some form.
Motivation_Man	Ned Stark didn't even know the game was being played though. He was completely oblivious to it. Sansa isn't. She's making a conscious choice to go against that power grab. She's still manipulating political events, but for a greater good. I suppose she's still playing the game, in that she's still trying to impact the political landscape of Westeros, but she has grown to have completely different motives from the others. She's a game player who values survival over power.
Motivation_Man	But she won't stop playing. She's still going to outplay Littlefinger and make sure his scheming is stopped. She's just not going to give in to the power he could give her, which is what almost every other player would do. She's still playing the game; she's just changing the rules.
Motivation_Man	Sorry man hahahaha, I thought you were implying I wasn't seeing Sansa's value. Her progression is one of my favourites in the series. 
Motivation_Man	Dude I didn't write the story. It's called GAME of thrones for a reason. It is essentially a game because in the end the political side was not as important as impending doom. But it's still important. It's going to have a direct impact on whether everyone will be able to survive what's coming. The political intrigue has always been one of my favourite parts of the show. It keeps it grounded and from just being about 'ice zombies and frost Wizards'. It develops a world that you care for and that has depth.  It's not as if none of it mattered. We've grown to love and root for characters over all those seasons. Every character has a purpose. Oberyn was far from useless; he had little screen time, but everyone loved him. It meant that his quick death hammered home just how brutal Westeros can be. Olenna was the last surviving member of an entire house for crying out loud; of course she mattered. Just because the political intrigue's impact is dwarfed by the impact of the White Walkers doesn't mean it all becomes irrelevant. That's like saying anything that doesn't directly impact the ending of a story is irrelevant. Does that mean Ned's story was irrelevant, or Robb's or the history of Robert's Rebellion? Of course not. Everyone's story gives us a different perspective of the world it takes place in. It all adds to the story and makes us care more. There's no point having an impending apocalypse in a story  if you don't care for the world in the first place. It's not the ending that's important; it's the journey. 
Motivation_Man	Well that's the real question. Is it possible for the characters of the show to come out on top despite it all, or is the scheming just human nature and all there is? You'd have to wait for the ending to find out where the show stands on it I suppose.
Motivation_Man	Because it's the whole point of the show. Humans are so power hungry that they'll ignore the prospect of imminent death just to latch on to it. the futility of the game is the whole point of the show. The ladder and climb are real, but it never reaches the top. The high lords just play at war like a game while the country suffers, and death itself comes marching. And still they play. Having characters like Sansa and Jon who can evolve beyond that is what gives the show some hope. But in all its about how futile war is when we should be banding together instead.  EDIT: Some say GRRM wrote the White  Walkers as a climate change analogy; we're all playing at petty politics paying no mind to the fact that it may be dooming the world.
Motivation_Man	Did you even read the post? It's not a sin for her to want to rule. Of course she wants to, and I think she would be a great ruler. But stealing the power from Jon would be a disaster. She can want to rule, and fantasise about it, but the main conflict Sansa has to face is that her ruling right now would split The North into those loyal to Jon and those loyal to her. When the White Walkers come, that spells disaster. I think in the end Sansa will be Lady of Winterfell, as Jon clearly has far more important shit to worry about, but now isn't the time for power grab. Sansa will make a great leader once everything's said and done.
Motivation_Man	It mattered in that whoever sat on that throne better have been able to fucking deal with evil incarnate showing up at the country's doorstep. They have everything to do with the Iron Throne. If this was any other time in the history of the Seven Kingdoms it would matter, every little bit of political scheming. But not when the army of the dead are coming. The political drama is almost pointless now if it's just about who sits on the Iron Throne. But it isn't. It directly impacts how the war against the White Walkers could go. The game will continue long after they're gone, true, but right now immenent death kind of puts a hold on things for all but the most power hungry.
Motivation_Man	I mean you're right, she could give in to Littlefinger and go for the power. It's possible, I just think her character's progressed to the point that she's past that. She's not that spoiled little girl who would value that above all else now. But we'll see.
Motivation_Man	The thing is, nobody is in a position to gain real power any more through any political manoeuvres. The game basically ends with Littlefinger, as after he's gone almost all attention will be focused north rather than south. Sansa knows about the army of the dead, and while she knows Cersei is still a threat, there's nothing she can do about it. Not really. I don't think Sansa wants power for power's sake. She's spent years of her life seeing where it leads people. I think ultimately Sansa will outplay Littlefinger, and use her political prowess to rally The North and The Vale in order to help Jon fight the war against the Night King. I think once Littlefinger and his plots are gone, Sansa will be done with 'the game'. There's not much left to play really, it's the end game now. The two main players through the course of the show have always been Littlefinger and Varys. Varys has chose his side, while Littlefinger keeps pushing for more power. It seems like he's bested everyone, but he doesn't realise one last player has been developing right under his nose, and in the end she's going to be the reason he loses.
Motivation_Man	Yeah true. Cersei still has a large force at her back, not to mention the potential funding of the Iron Bank and Euron's fleet. While I don't think Cersei will help, and will likely double cross everyone in some way, at least trying to win her over is literally the only option.
Motivation_Man	Very true. If all of Westeros doesn't band together as one big pack they're all going to die really.
Motivation_Man	I don't want the Starks to survive this season | If they do that, it would be extraordinarily frustrating.  Folks need to put their big boy/girl pants on and realize that this is A Song Of Ice And Fire. If they want a Cinderella-type finish, they don't need to be invested in this story.  Dan and Dave are idiots, but I don't think they're that idiotic. It's going to be bittersweet. Just like the books. Just as it's supposed to be with Medieval, feudal society. You want a happy ending? Kindly hurl yourself out of a tenth floor window.  This is why I always say that I love GOT/ASOIAF, but despise it's fandom.
Motivation_Man	There's a theory floating about that what we are seeing ARE the old legends of how to stop the Night King, and this is their first attack. After all is said and done, Bran travels back to warn people of how to stop the future disaster and what lessons should be learned. Over the years though, the figures simply become legend, and people assume this war already took place. The very flawed figures become myth, their flaws forgotten. It would be really GRRM like I think. Demonstrating that the stories we know usually have more depth to them.
Motivation_Man	I [19 M] hate seeming like a 'nice guy', but I never have any luck with girls and I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong | [removed]
Motivation_Man	I feel like you're on to something here. Most times a girl has flirted with me I kind of freeze up and inadvertently shut it down and don't push the envelope cause I second guess myself. Like what if she wasn't trying to flirt? Am I making it weird? It's easier to avoid awkwardness by just not pushing it further, which is what stops me getting anywhere.  A big example is this one girl in friends with. There's a kind of joke in my group of friends that we're like gonna end up together or whatever, cause we always jokingly flirt. Almost every time we see each other there's constant jokes between us about being in a relationship (like for example if I piss her off she'll be like 'I thought we had something' and shit.) Sometimes there's been more obvious real flirting between us though, but again, she's one of the cases where it's been made clear 'it's only a joke'. Maybe your right though and it started off as something more and I shut it down by not letting things escalate or whatever.
Motivation_Man	Yeah reading that it seems like I'm like obsessed with that dude's sex life hahahaha. I'm really not, it was just the best comparison point I could think of.   The thing is I have asked girls out. Every time it's been like a soft rejection, followed by awkwardness and whatever else. Any other time I've had a crush on a girl I've either not asked them out (I've got better at this in recent years though), or they have a boyfriend. I've not asked out like hundreds of girls, but it's not like I've not tried at all. It just seems like when I do I've misread the whole thing, which just makes me feel more shitty about it all. It's tough.
Motivation_Man	Yeah I've had quite a few crushes. The group of girls I mentioned are friends first of all, although saying that I'm a teenage guy and I'd probably hook up with almost any of them the offer was there. But I wouldn't just hook up with anyone, and I certainly wouldn't consider a serious relationship unless I felt like I 'clicked' with someone. Usually if I do feel like I connect with someone like that I'll crush on them, and I tend to crush hard. I used to be really bad, to the point I once had a crush on a girl who for months who I'd never talked to, but I grew out of that immature shit. Now if I have a crush on someone I'll get to know them and try ask them out. So far it's just ended in soft rejections, and having to give up when they get into another relationship or whatever, but I've got better at trying to at least make some effort. It's never actually led anywhere yet though.
Motivation_Man	I mean yeah I get you, I wouldn't expect anyone to be jumping at me after reading this shit hahahaha, it's horribly insecure and unconfident. In real life I act nothing like this. I don't think anyone would see me as being this unconfident and insecure. I'm pretty good at faking it. If somebody does on some rare occasion flirt with me, I'll flirt back, but 9 times out of ten it's made clear its just a bit of a joke and any other time it just doesn't really go anywhere.  
Motivation_Man	I've asked girls out here and there yes, but it's usually a soft no and then shit gets awkward or whatever. I'll admit I don't do it often though, it takes me a shit ton of time to work up the courage. 
Motivation_Man	I'm not like obsessed with his sex life, it's just typical male bullshit at this age that guys give each other shit over their success with girls or whatever. The only reason I make the comparison is cause it's the first example that came to mind and I'm usually reminded about the 'gap' between us by the guy himself. I don't really care, like your right it has absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just easy to use your friends as a point of reference I suppose.  And it's not like I go out and whine about all this. I've never talked to anyone I know about this shit. People wouldn't really know I'm like unconfident or whatever, and I certainly don't try police people. I think I kind of just come across like aloof and not caring much about it all in real life, when I suppose it gets to me more than I admit.  You are right I should be more direct, I think that may be the main issue. I just don't know when the right time is to like make a move, or whatever. If I make a real conscious effort to try  second guess anything I do really. Maybe that will stop with just getting out my comfort zone and putting myself out there, but it's tough. Some people just seem to like naturally 'get it', whereas I have almost no idea how to turn a connection I feel into something more without fucking it up and feeling awkward. 
Motivation_Man	Yeah see I know I sound like a niceguy and I hate it, but it's just hard not to get a little bitter sometimes. But the thing is like he won't ever actually ask a girl out, you know? It's more like drunken one night stands or like just flirting with them for ages over Facebook or some shit. Never anything serious. He's not asking anyone out either, and yet he has girls throwing thenselves at him. Like if we're both out together it seems as if most girls we meet would just naturally gravitate to him over me. He'll make a move because he knows there already interested, whereas I never get that interest at all.  I know that it's probably some thing wrong with me that I need to work on but I just don't know what to 'work on'. Like obviously I'm not perfect, but I don't see what would make me seem so damn unattractive to like every person.
Motivation_Man	"Come on, Roach!"
Motivation_Man	Thanks. You're right, I should go. It would mean a lot to her and I'm not gonna let my emotions get in the way. Not going might make her think she's done something wrong, and making her feel bad because of how I feel would be playing the 'nice guy' friendzone bullshit card. I don't want to be that guy.  Funnily enough, I went out and got drunk last night with my friends and ended up drunkedly messaging her. Turns out she was out too and she tried to get me to leave my friends and go do some shit with her. I just told her I can't leave them, but fuck it, I'll be there Saturday. She seemed really happy. So now I'm locked into it I suppose.   As for the side note, I didn't ask if her boyfriend's going actually. He might well be. I'm sure I can be mature enough for a night to at least be nice to the guy though, dude's done nothing wrong to me.
Motivation_Man	Thanks! I told her I'm gonna come along last night and she said a few other people from work are going too, so at least I'll have people to fall back on or whatever. Honestly I'm just gonna go and try have the best time I can, and at least be able to say I went and showed face. I'm her friend first and foremost; it would be pretty shitty of me to let my emotions get in the way of celebrating with her.
Motivation_Man	[S7 Spoilers for real I have guessed Jaime's nuanced story arc new accurate theory] Jaime, Cersei, Euron and bad poosy | So I thought about what Euron said about Cersei. I wondered; why would Jaime have to put finger in the bum? Why not finger in vagina?  And then it hit me. It's all been leading to this.  Think back to Jaime's Dorne storyline. Think about what the sand snakes said to Bronn. U want a good gal but u need the bad poosy. Seems like just an erotic throwaway line that is easily forgotten, but look closer. Can you see it?  It's talking about Jaime. He wants the good girl (m'lady Brienne of Tarth) but he needs the bad poosy (Cersei)  Now how do we know Cersei is the bad poosy? After all, anyone could be the poosy that was promised.  Well, it links back to what Euron said to Jaime. How he needs to put finger in bum. It's because Cersei has the bad poosy. Jaime thinks he needs it, but this realisation will make him develop as a character and fucking kill Cersei the stupid cunt bitch whore I hate women so much and female characters are the worst.  No tinfoil.  Also I think Cersei will be like the Mad Queen.
Motivation_Man	[Season Winter 7 Spoilers Euron gets gayscale] DAE Cersei would hate finger in the bum? | The fucking writing in the show has gone to shit. It's like a fanfic. Every REAL fan of GRRM's masterpiece knows Cersei doesn't like a finger in the bum, she instead likes a Myrish swamp and Moonboy. If D&D had included the slightest bit of subtle nuance they might have reflected this, but instead we're left with Cersei's full sexuality unexplored. How many more characters can they butcher before this show is cancelled?
Motivation_Man	There's actually a scene in season one where Aemon asks Jon what his father would do if he had to choose between honor on one hand, and love on the other. Jon replies he would do the right thing, not knowing Ned actually had to make that decision in regards to him, and it was the most impactful choice he ever made. 
Motivation_Man	I'm desperate for human connection, but all I manage to do is push people away | Man, I'm fucking fed up. I feel like fucking BoJack Horseman. Technically my life's completely fine, and I fuck it up. I can see the mistakes I make and why I make them. I have a constant need to feel liked by everyone that turns me into a fucking pushover and means I never just do what I truly want. Hell, I don't even fucking know what I want anymore. And yet I'm too crippled by depression, fear, laziness, whatever else to change anything.  It's just constant. I want to do something meaningful, but I spend every spare weekday I have wasting away in my room. The weekends I get drunk/high with friends and try find some temporary happiness. I go to college and can't tell if the course isn't for me or I'm just too unmotivated to try anymore. Either way I've made no friends after a full year there and I've considered dropping out multiple times. I would have by now if it wasn't for how disappointed people would be in me. I'd have literally nothing, apart from a shitty part time job that I consider quitting more and more everyday, with the only thing stopping me being a futile crush I have on a coworker that I cling onto for no reason (especially considering she has a fucking boyfriend). It's sad really; the person I'd be if I had things my way is an unemployed college drop out.  I'm given chances to change shit though and I just fucking don't. Little moments of potential happiness that I sabotage myself with. But beyond all that I think the thing I crave most is true human connection, I try so hard to just be liked by people. And 99% of the time people do really like me, but nobody really KNOWS me. You know? Apart from maybe one or two of my very closest friends, nobody has a clue what inside my head's like. I'm just a nice, approachable and funny guy.  But man inside I feel like I die a bit everyday. There's two times I'd say I feel happy; when I am out at the weekend with friends and have a night where I feel like I truly connect with them, and when I'm around that girl from work I mentioned. I'm just desperate for someone to 'fix' me, but nobody can. I push people away for some subconscious reason. I never truly completely open up with my friends; the closest I've got is making sarcastic jokes about hating myself and being depressed (which have far more truth than they would ever believe).   And with that girl I'm 100% sure she liked me at one point. Like really was properly into me. I've never been that sure before. We were like best friends at one point. But I was too scared to take a chance and now she's dating someone else. That's tough to deal with man. Knowing that someone actually valued me that much and I just pissed it away. We still talk in work and shit, but it's just not the same. I think we both realise what happened between us. For a few weeks after she started dating this guy we didn't talk much at all, when before we talked everyday. She's recently tried to reach back out to me, even inviting me out with her and her closest friends for her birthday. I just joked that I have a busy schedule and I'd have to see. Plus we're not really in the same social circle. She really wanted me there though; she even told me I could bring a friend along. But again, out of fear and a bunch of other shit I just can't face going. I'm scared to go out without my friends there; I'm scared of saying something to her I regret; I know I'd get jealous of her and her boyfriend; I know I'd ultimately be fooling myself into thinking I can have a close friendship with someone I clearly want much more with. And the thing is if I wasn't so fucking scared of just being honest with people, I might have had.  Really that whole situation actually sums me up now that I've typed it out. I want some close human connection, but when someone comes along and smacks me in the face trying to be there for me, and wants to know me, I fuck it up somehow. I don't do anything, and ultimately I push them away cause I'm too scared and can't face people when I know I fucked up with them. I just want to please everyone, and in the end by trying I only push people away. I can't be honest about who I am. I want someone to be there for me, but it's impossible if I can't fix my own shit. I can't open up to people, and the minute I feel vulnerable about my feelings I actively try to close myself off. It's a shitty shitty cycle.  **TL;DR:** Life feels hollow, cause right now I'm unsatisfied/unhappy with almost everything I do. The only time I feel remotely happy is when I'm on the verge of some human connection, but as soon as I feel myself getting vulnerable with someone or have to admit how I feel deeps down, I withdraw, isolate myself and somehow fuck it up.

There's two times I'd say I feel happy; when I am out at the weekend with friends and have a night where I feel like I truly connect with them, and when I'm around that girl from work I mentioned. I'm just desperate for someone to 'fix' me, but nobody can. I push people away for some subconscious reason. I never truly completely open up with my friends; the closest I've got is making sarcastic jokes about hating myself and being depressed (which have far more truth than they would ever believe).   And with that girl I'm 100% sure she liked me at one point. Like really was properly into me. I've never been that sure before. We were like best friends at one point. But I was too scared to take a chance and now she's dating someone else. That's tough to deal with man. Knowing that someone actually valued me that much and I just pissed it away. We still talk in work and shit, but it's just not the same. I think we both realise what happened between us. For a few weeks after she started dating this guy we didn't talk much at all, when before we talked everyday. She's recently tried to reach back out to me, even inviting me out with her and her closest friends for her birthday. I just joked that I have a busy schedule and I'd have to see. Plus we're not really in the same social circle. She really wanted me there though; she even told me I could bring a friend along. But again, out of fear and a bunch of other shit I just can't face going. I'm scared to go out without my friends there; I'm scared of saying something to her I regret; I know I'd get jealous of her and her boyfriend; I know I'd ultimately be fooling myself into thinking I can have a close friendship with someone I clearly want much more with. And the thing is if I wasn't so fucking scared of just being honest with people, I might have had.  Really that whole situation actually sums me up now that I've typed it out. I want some close human connection, but when someone comes along and smacks me in the face trying to be there for me, and wants to know me, I fuck it up somehow. I don't do anything, and ultimately I push them away cause I'm too scared and can't face people when I know I fucked up with them. I just want to please everyone, and in the end by trying I only push people away. I can't be honest about who I am. I want someone to be there for me, but it's impossible if I can't fix my own shit. I can't open up to people, and the minute I feel vulnerable about my feelings I actively try to close myself off. It's a shitty shitty cycle.  **TL;DR:** Life feels hollow, cause right now I'm unsatisfied/unhappy with almost everything I do. The only time I feel remotely happy is when I'm on the verge of some human connection, but as soon as I feel myself getting vulnerable with someone or have to admit how I feel deeps down, I withdraw, isolate myself and somehow fuck it up. 
Motivation_Man	I [19 M] feel like my life is hollow without deep human connection, but all I do is push people away | Man, I'm fucking fed up. I feel like fucking BoJack Horseman. Technically my life's completely fine, and I fuck it up. I can see the mistakes I make and why I make them. I have a constant need to feel liked by everyone that turns me into a fucking pushover and means I never just do what I truly want. Hell, I don't even fucking know what I want anymore. And yet I'm too crippled by depression, fear, laziness, whatever else to change anything.  It's just constant. I want to do something meaningful, but I spend every spare weekday I have wasting away in my room. The weekends I get drunk/high with friends and try find some temporary happiness. I go to college and can't tell if the course isn't for me or I'm just too unmotivated to try anymore. Either way I've made no friends after a full year there and I've considered dropping out multiple times. I would have by now if it wasn't for how disappointed people would be in me. I'd have literally nothing, apart from a shitty part time job that I consider quitting more and more everyday, with the only thing stopping me being a futile crush I have on a coworker that I cling onto for no reason (especially considering she has a fucking boyfriend). It's sad really; the person I'd be if I had things my way is an unemployed college drop out.  I'm given chances to change shit though and I just fucking don't. Little moments of potential happiness that I sabotage myself with. But beyond all that I think the thing I crave most is true human connection, I try so hard to just be liked by people.

IvanBalvan128Rus	I just cut myself for the first time | I'm sorry   And i did something i'm not very proud of.,,  Sorry Emily i'm really sorry   Please don't hate me   It is all my fault 
IvanBalvan128Rus	Sounds logical 
IvanBalvan128Rus	I remember rengar destroying turrets with 2 Qs 
IvanBalvan128Rus	Fuck off from EuW  About 80% EuW Players opinion 
IvanBalvan128Rus	Jokes on you Riot isn't that American. Tencent owns about 95% of Riot Games.  And soccer was made it in England does that mean that other countries shouldn't get equally treated? 
IvanBalvan128Rus	This is not an issue with the AI,it is the tech tree.  I was also like 10 techs up in a mutliplayer match against my friends but they just clicked onto ballistics/steel/Replace.. and ignored most of the techs like mediv walls/castles/crowsbows just to get the strong units.
IvanBalvan128Rus	Inb4 Na mods remove this.
IvanBalvan128Rus	Why has NA no Semifinalist team?  Why does Na's best team don't have much Americans?  Why are you Americans so fat?  So many questions.
IvanBalvan128Rus	Salty NA Fan.  Thought all of you were in the Western Club?  Na will never be a good region, you are behind Wildcard.
IvanBalvan128Rus	500.  I'm already drunk.
IvanBalvan128Rus	[Fix] Nothing happens after pressing "Play" on Steam. (Windows 7) | Hello bois,  Hopfefully a fix for everyone.  1. Restart your Computer.  2.Deinstall both 2015 visual c++  (http://imgur.com/a/KnX6R)  3.Restart your Computer.(It always gives you an Error that a Setup is already running if you don't do it)  4.Download c++ 2015 Visual (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=48145)  5.Install both 2015 Visual c++   6.Restart again (Safe is safe)  7.Start Civ  This should fix the problem of having a missing dll file and it should let you start civ.
IvanBalvan128Rus	No no no,  It's Haram my friend.  Muahmmed had no League, so you don't need it anyways.
IvanBalvan128Rus	Did you restarted?
IvanBalvan128Rus	Do you get the error by deinstalling or by installing
IvanBalvan128Rus	I only restarted it because it gave me an Error that a Setup was still running.  If you have no  problems by deinstalling it should work-
IvanBalvan128Rus	It works perfectly fine for me
IvanBalvan128Rus	Will do it.
IvanBalvan128Rus	Hopefully a fix for everyone   1. Restart your Computer.  2.Deinstall both 2015 visual c++  (http://imgur.com/a/KnX6R)  3.Restart your Computer.(It always gives you an Error that a Setup is already running if you don't do it)  4.Download c++ 2015 Visual (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=48145)  5.Install both 2015 Visual c++   6.Restart again (Safe is safe)  7.Start Civ  It worked for me
IvanBalvan128Rus	I searched the missing DLL "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll" in google  And it popped something up with C ++ 2015.  I still can't install it properly maybe the Setup in the CIV folder is corrupt or something like that will download it form the Microsoft page and report
IvanBalvan128Rus	Yes some sort of dll is missing 
IvanBalvan128Rus	Running Windows 7 Service Pack 1  Verify Game Cache didn't work.  I reinstall vcredist atm because it took years in the first time setup in steam  /steam/steamapps/common/Civ6/commonredist/vcredist/  Currently stuck in the 2015 pack(windows7_MSU_x64) maybe because i don't have the newst updates?
IvanBalvan128Rus	I have the same issue.  There could be more reason for this :  Mistake by the first time setup or some missing files  Connected back to my old IP and verify files atm.
IvanBalvan128Rus	You forgot Churchhill and Hirohito.  Both of them also started genocides
IvanBalvan128Rus	It would only get banned if they show Hitlers face,nazi Flag or name the empire "Drittes Reich".  They can put Hitler in it but they need to censor his face and use other names and flags.  Btw: These anti-Nazi laws are stupid,films and art can use the nazi flag and Hitler but games can't use him. Games should have the same rights as art and films.
WhatDoIDoWithLife	I'm broken. (x-post from /r/offmychest) | Sally, Jessica, April, Maddison, and I were best friends. We were really good friends(we called each other sisters). They were the only people I could actually trust and love. They were there for me when I had hard times. Jessica and April are gone now. And it hurts so much.  My parents are giving me a very hard time. They say such horrible things to me and they make me feel worthless. They say they don't love me. They say that they wish they could put me back into my mother's womb and have another baby. They say that I'm a failure and disappointment. They say I'm trash. My parents sometimes tries to hit me when they get angry. It hurts me.  School is very tough. There is so much homework and tests. It's insane. The teachers are giving me suspicious glares all the time. I'm already having a hard time outside of school. Why do they have to do that? I'm trying my best in school to get good grades, be respectful and obedient to the teachers, and be nice to all the students. It's so hard because I'm hurting and school is making my life even more stressful.  On Friday, after school, I went out to drink at a bar. Maddison, Emma, and Sally didn't want me to. They wanted me to have dinner with them. They were so worried for me. I completely dismissed their feelings and I only thought of myself.  I went out, with heavy makeup and a very skimpy outfit. I was supposed to meet this guy, but I left because he was being such a creep. I drank beer by myself. There was a lot of uncomfortable stares from guys and some even tried to ask me out, but I refused. I'm so thankful that I didn't do anything stupid.  I went to Sally's house, completely drunk. I collapsed on her bed. I started laughing at everything. Then, I started bawling my eyes out. Sally's mom found out that I was drunk. She comforted me. I spilled out everything on my chest to her. I cried so, so much.  Saturday morning, I get a text from Jessica. She has moved on from our friendship. She found new friends. She moved to a new school. She doesn't care about me anymore. I cried so hard. When I told Sally about this, she cried too.  I'm crying as I write this. Life is so hurtful and stressful. I'm hurting so much. I'm empty inside. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I don't know how to deal with all this, other than drinking alcohol. I'm so broken.

gestandnis	20 years old and my only interest is video games | Nothing else seems fun or worthwhile at all. Only going to college so that I can say I'm doing something, I literally cannot imagine going into an office every day for the rest of my life. So most of my days are spent going to class for 1 - 8 hours and then going straight home to my parents' house and games. No friends to speak of, relationship is never going to happen, I barely even speak during the day.    I don't have anything at all going for me right now.
gestandnis	Sometimes when you're depressed you do things to make yourself feel worse because the only thing you feel is depression.
gestandnis	😍 cute!
gestandnis	Everyone is emotionally fragile, some are just really good at hiding it.
gestandnis	Have you tried \*generic advice that works for normal people*?
gestandnis	top 10 anime betrayals 
gestandnis	They fit me and I use them a lot.
gestandnis	She knows.
gestandnis	But how can you stay 500 feet away from your own ass?
gestandnis	Just turn your computer upside down and it should work.
gestandnis	Never seen another DL in real life (or at least I didn't notice any). I've never heard of any meetups in my city anyways, not that I would want people in real life to see me diapered.
gestandnis	I've worn pullups to college before. It's a fun experience, although I never wet them.
gestandnis	Well it's not that bad. At least there's no random apostrophes.
gestandnis	[Clicky](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md)
gestandnis	This is a very useful bot for mobile users, don't downvote!
gestandnis	What are you even trying to say?
gestandnis	Definitely that one first \*points*
gestandnis	No bathroom breaks!
gestandnis	But how is this the worst of both communities? It's just a drawing of a tv show character on a diaper.
gestandnis	Perhaps there's something wrong with the way he cooks if it gives everyone the shits?
gestandnis	Explain.
gestandnis	You have a very good writing style.
gestandnis	I love messing. Knowing that I could easily use the toilet and avoid all the cleanup but choosing to deliberately let loose in my pants is the best feeling.
gestandnis	Not something I would share with normie friends but you do you.
gestandnis	Good luck hiding 96 diapers at once.
gestandnis	What if you didn't fall asleep padded?
gestandnis	Good bot
gestandnis	I don't even think I have a local abdl group, and besides I'm not really interested in the abdl lifestyle.
gestandnis	 Not me
gestandnis	Why do you want to wear diapers at work? 
gestandnis	It's a SFW chat, so that shouldn't be a problem.
gestandnis	There's the ABDL/TBDL group at [t.me/abdltbdl](http://t.me/abdltbdl), although it's small right now and most definitely not local.
gestandnis	I just said "guess I'm into diapers now." My interest is fading though
gestandnis	Did you make it clear that this was a part of yourself before you got into the serious part of the relationship?
gestandnis	Limiting content is something that smaller subreddits just shouldn't do. It's already right on the edge by forcing pics to meet a vague standard.
gestandnis	Not where I live it doesn't.
gestandnis	Which kermit is adult you in this scenario?
gestandnis	Or just stronger elastic material.
gestandnis	How do you plan on enforcing the age rule?
gestandnis	I don't exactly wear diapers because they're fashionable...
gestandnis	Must have been an unfortunate chainsaw accident.
gestandnis	Normies are easily startled but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.
gestandnis	I've always kind of known but now it's sexual.
gestandnis	Why exactly did you pick this subreddit to post spoilers? 
gestandnis	We'll just have to shrink you down a bit.
gestandnis	Well, you're wearing all your protective gear :P
gestandnis	No, *you're* cute.
gestandnis	Yeah that's *way* too far, especially when most of the people here use throwaway accounts.
gestandnis	Maybe instead of shitting on OP you should link said threads.
gestandnis	I have over 300 confirmed kinkshames.
gestandnis	<3
gestandnis	Although I am a furry, conventions are not something I see myself doing in the next few years because I have terrible anxiety and no friends.
gestandnis	"Would you mind pointing this gun at yourself while I change you?"
gestandnis	I recognized it right away
gestandnis	We're the worst of subs, we're the best of subs.
gestandnis	That's literally the pattern on abena abriform diapers and I assume the actual earbud part of the headphones has a woodgrain pattern.
gestandnis	Brilliant.
gestandnis	I want this but I don't have my own washing machine :(
gestandnis	I'm a big kid!    *pulls up goodnite*   See? Underwear.
gestandnis	But it only works if your package is being fulfilled by amazon. 
gestandnis	West coast.
gestandnis	When looking at yourself through another's perspective, al you need to ask yourself is if what you are doing is hurting anyone.
gestandnis	I just got my pack of 34, the box says "34 ct," "L/XL," "for boys," etc. It also has Kimberly-Clark branding and phone numbers, although it doesn't explicitly say "goodnites." There's a small gap in the box where you can vaguely see the contents, and depending on how the actual diapers are packaged may reveal what they are.    Your best bet is to check "ship in amazon box" in the shipping options as others have suggested. 
gestandnis	Yeah, pretty far away from me.
gestandnis	In the interest of keeping my fetishes and emotions bottled up inside, I ship all my abdl purchases to an amazon locker rather than my house.
gestandnis	You're just giving them away?
gestandnis	I don't know about diaper suggestions but it should not be hard to get rid of the ones you don't want (depending on how much you want for them). /r/abdlexchange and craigslist come to mind. How much were you looking to get?
gestandnis	And here I am barely fitting into the XL goodnites! I wear size 32 jeans, and "loose" is not a word I get to use to describe wearing goodnites.
gestandnis	What's your waist size? I don't think my goodnites fit as well as that...
gestandnis	Where do you live? I don't know if I really want them cause I don't get as much enjoyment out of them as others.
gestandnis	I used to dream about finding packs of diapers in random places around my house. They stopped when I actually got some diapers, although I don't wear them.
gestandnis	I think you and I have different definitions of "pleasantly tired" :P
gestandnis	It still feels like there's not many posts though. Only a few each day to read. I think there's a lot of lurkers.
gestandnis	Doing sports at all feels awful.
gestandnis	Wait are they still locked in the drawer?
gestandnis	I play a lot of different games, but unfortunately I don't have friends to play with so they're mostly single player or I play with randoms.
gestandnis	That's actually a very generic title and plot for this sort of thing.
gestandnis	It's fairly easy if your waist is around 32 inches or so.
gestandnis	Adult diapers are your best option, but if you really want to wear goodnites then you could set it as a weight loss goal :P I do fit into goodnites but I have the same issue with hips and butt.
gestandnis	You aren't going to lose bowel continence from a hypnosis file unless you *really* want to. Most of those untraining guides are only referring to urinary incontinence.
gestandnis	Glob is dead and we killed him.
gestandnis	I give you the [ADISC Diapering Tutorial](http://www.adisc.org/forum/showthread.php/83448-How-to-Put-On-a-Diaper).
gestandnis	I just do normal stuff during diaper time.
gestandnis	Never take pictures of anything you want to keep private. Even if you trust your partner and they would never intentionally leak the pictures, accidents happen. I mean it really only takes one mistake.
gestandnis	I only wear like once or twice every month. I have half a pack of m4s left that I bought about five months ago. The times I want to wear and the times that I'm alone don't often overlap. However, when my goodnites come in I'll wear those more often because they're less conspicuous.
gestandnis	See I did that until I could no longer sleep without them, then I gave it up.
gestandnis	Because they're cheap and really thick.
gestandnis	I remember my first time, feeling just how you described. After thinking about it for years and years I was finally in a diaper! Best feeling ever. Anyway, I hope you continue to enjoy yourself.
gestandnis	Diapers and furries don't mix for me. I wouldn't go to a furry event in a diaper, but the few times I do get padded I like to wear my tail as well. I'm not into the babyfur scene, basically, although I do like the furry/dl porn.    Actually I'm not very active in either of these communities because I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm not really sure if I want to get more involved. One of the problems is that my interest in both communities is mostly sexual.    I can't really even draw and I don't have a fursona, and I've never been to an event, so I'm not even sure why I call myself a furry to be honest.
gestandnis	Have fun!
gestandnis	Hello, welcome to Costco, I love you. 
gestandnis	Gallon sized Ziploc is 26.8 cm by 27.3 cm. They're big enough for a thoroughly soaked abena m4, and I think the l4 would fit as well.    Also can't you just but gallon sized Ziplocs from amazon?
gestandnis	Hi there, punch is in the corner.
gestandnis	What's your waist measurement?
gestandnis	What brand are those?
gestandnis	But I'm not a wolf...
gestandnis	I was asking cause I thought they fit really well on this adult waist.
gestandnis	I've been considering buying one of these so I'm less afraid of my parents walking in on me while I'm wearing a diaper. No crinkle means it's not likely to be noticed. My only concern of course would be washing it without raising suspicion.
gestandnis	I think it's really fun :P   You can't wear diapers unless you prove that you need them by wetting your pants a few times.
gestandnis	If you have a 28 inch waist you should be able to wear Goodnites pull ups. I have a 32 inch waist and I fit into their XL size easily. Goodnites are designed for children and teenagers with bedwetting issues.
LovelyPositivity	How do you deal with sadness? | Let me start off by saying that I'm not suicidal, I don't even think I'm depressed but r/melancholy doesn't get posted to much so this seemed like the right place. Recently, I've been feeling miserable more and more often. I'll be having a decent day and be seemingly randomly hit with a wave of woe that I can't seem to shake. When this happens, I suck to be around and I suck to be. Basically, it sucks.  My question is, how do you deal with run-of-the-mill sadness? It feels like I might be able to get out of it if I did something but whenever it happens I struggle to shake it.  I hope this was okay to post and that, if so, the replies might help some people.
LovelyPositivity	Off the bat, I want to say that you seem like a good person. Life can really throw you around at times and the fact you still care about people and want to love (and be loved) is telling of the type of person you are: one with a good heart.  In regards to the detached feeling, I get that from time to time to and it feels being trapped at the bottom of a deep, dark well. What I find has helped for me in the past, is trying to recalibrate. Just take a few minutes or maybe a couple of hours to get in the right head space. Focus on your breathing and try not think about what's going on too much. When I'm in that state, it's usually because I can't get out of my own head and be present, even when things are going on around me. I hope that helps at all and just know that you're not alone in that respect.  You say that you felt like you were saving love for someone who will love you back. In my opinion (and experience), love is not finite. Remember that your love goes as far you as choose, you needn't save it all up for one guy, you can get the same reciprocal love from friends and family that you can get from a partner. Plus, if you truly care for someone, and let them know it, they will more than likely care for you in return.  When it comes to you being horny, there are certainly ways of dealing with that by yourself. I'm not too well versed in those waters being a guy, but I assure the internet will be able to get you going on that.  Definitely don't sweat the concert tickets too much but at the same time, don't get too crazy with spending. In my mind, if we can't spend money on things that make us happy, what's the point? And it sounds like the concert was really helpful for you.  If I was to leave you with one thing, it would be (and is), if ever you feel like you're overthinking things or everything is becoming too much, take a step back, breath and try as best you can to just live. It sounds like you were doing this at the concert and hopefully you can get that feeling out of regular life. [Here's Chris Evans talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxmT_ckNPLE) He's far more eloquent than me so I'll let him do the heavy lifting.  I really hopes this helps.
LovelyPositivity	This is something I really don't like about how social interaction works but unfortunately there is little we can do about it. Most people you meet and interact with seem happy but I'm willing to bet they are most likely plagued with insecurities that could very well be the same as yours. It's a sad thought but a lot of people live in the moment during the evenings but are kept awake at night with stifling thoughts.  When it comes to money, if you are spending money on something that you want (to do), it is never a waste. Obviously there are exceptions like if you are spending your last penny on drinks. Be smart about it but don't feel it's a waste.  Now, I don't know you or what you look like so I don't know if you're ugly or not. BUT, I assure you that if you go outside, everyone is far too consumed by their own lives to take too much notice. I don't know much about how you feel on this, if you're okay with explaining, feel free. You can PM me if you like as well.
LovelyPositivity	I don't really know what to say here. What *is* clear is that you've been through far more than most have and your ability to keep going shows true strength and I trust that you'll pull through if not for yourself (which you should not overlook) then for those who depend on you.  You seem an admirable person and I see this story sticking with me for a long time. I hope that you can persevere through these hard times; just remember how many times you've done so in the past.  If you ever feel like you have no one to talk to in future, feel free to PM me. You're not alone. Stay strong :)
LovelyPositivity	If you're okay with sharing what's happened with you, feel free to reply or PM if you want to. :)
LovelyPositivity	If you don't mind sharing, I'd be interested to hear what has happened with you.
LovelyPositivity	It sounds like you've one heck of a good relationship going on there.  If ever you miss him, just remember that (I hope) this is something that he enjoys and that doing it will make him happy. Just picture him with a big goofy smile on his face driving down a massive road.  Also, it might help to think of it in that your time together is now more valuable than ever, you've got to make the most of it and it's something to really get excited for.
LovelyPositivity	"I'm a sad man. Write whatever you want about me." - Tomohiro Ishii
LovelyPositivity	I assure that you are good enough for people. In my opinion as long as you're not negatively affecting people, which I doubt you are, I assume you just lack confidence, then you are good enough for anyone's friendship. Also, I'm sure you'll find people who instantly latch onto you (confidence really helps with this, people like confident people).  In terms of your mother, unless she's really homophobic, I suggest being open with her about it. She may not be warm to it at first but I'm willing to bet she'll come to terms with it. (ALSO I'M NOT AWARE OF THE LGBT SITUATION IN COLOMBIA SO USE YOUR OWN DISCRETION ON THIS ONE, THE WORLD IS CATCHING UP IN A LOT OF PLACES).  If you want to feel good about yourself and confident, suicide is not the right move. For many people, coming out can really help their confidence in themselves (THOUGH AGAIN IT MAY WELL BE REALLY TOUGH BEING GAY IN COLOMBIA BUT I DON'T KNOW).  I hope this helps. Feel free to PM me anytime, you can feel less lonely with me in the back of your mind :)
LovelyPositivity	This is great. I really appreciate it.
LovelyPositivity	Feel free to PM me. What's on your mind?
LovelyPositivity	What's going on, dude? Feel free to PM me.
LovelyPositivity	I like to think it's safe to assume that most people posting here are at the very least open to advice. I've never had a hostile response and even if I did, I'd rather risk giving someone advice and them be miffed than not post anything and have someone who really needed something go without any help.  Either way, I think this sub is great, it's small so most people who post will be responded to and the whole page is really nice. Shout out to the mods, you guys are really good people.
LovelyPositivity	It's fine, I'd rather act and risk someone just not needing than ignoring something and missing out on someone who does need it (especially on this sub).  However, if I may add, life's point is largely self prescribed in my opinion, which is why people seem to have such diverse drives in life. I once heard living purposefully described as having what you're passionate about, what you're good at and what you're paid for all being the same thing. I don't know if that makes sense or helps but it makes sense to me and helps me figure shit out.  Life isn't inherently pointless though it often seems that way. The issue is you've got to decide the point yourself.  This probably doesn't help but I hope it does.
LovelyPositivity	Ah the travelling will have to wait then. Don't forget about it though.  What video games do you play?
LovelyPositivity	If you want someone to talk to PM me.  Remember that you may have made mistakes in the past but that doesn't mean you will in the future. You may have lost something now but the future can be bright for a version of you that has learnt from their past mistakes and is all the better and happier for it.
LovelyPositivity	Maybe you should do something a little less normal. Go travelling or something, go up a mountain or visit Paris. Challenge yourself to do the most exciting thing possible and don't stop until you've think life isn't necessarily boring.   Also what sort of hobbies do you have? I'd be down for talking about them if I know a thing or two about them. Talking about my interests with people makes them a lot more interesting and exciting.
LovelyPositivity	PM me if you want.
LovelyPositivity	If you want to take your mind of it, PM me and we can talk about movies or something, anything you're interested in.
LovelyPositivity	PM if you want to talk about it. :)  Just to add, it's not necessarily your fault if relationships end. It's often no-ones fault. Things like this are complex and in the vast majority of cases you really shouldn't blame yourself.
LovelyPositivity	Just because you've made mistakes in the past, doesn't mean you're destined to repeat them in the future. You're halfway there already, you've recognised what you're doing wrong and now all you need to do is control yourself, recognise when you're going to repeat your mistakes and choose not to.  Also, you'd be surprised how far a sincere apology will go, I'm sure this person will really appreciate it.
LovelyPositivity	Your body may well just be a little off. Make sure you're eating right, sleeping right and going outside enough. Sometimes not getting enough of these things can you leave you feeling a bit shit.
LovelyPositivity	PM me, let's talk this out.
LovelyPositivity	Feel free to PM me :)
LovelyPositivity	Are you wondering whether or not he can show he cares about you or his depression? Either way I think the best thing you can do is to ask him to talk to you and just listen and try to understand. It'll strengthen your relationship and you understanding of your boyfriend.  And hug him ASAP.
LovelyPositivity	I think at this point, judging from what you've written (I obviously don't have all the information so take this with a pinch of salt), you need to just forget about him and at the very least don't interact with him if he does reach out again.  If someone cause you more harm than good, be it physical or emotional, and they keep doing it, it's very hard to justify them actually being good for you. Most importantly, just because you lost your virginity to him, does not mean that you are obligated to be with him. Please don't think this way.  Try to learn to enjoy being by yourself and you'll stop missing the companionship of someone else. This is obviously easier said than done but it's gonna be the best way to forget about him.  Hope this helps :)
LovelyPositivity	You're using a throwaway so you likely won't see this but it might help someone else so I'll post it anyway.  I feel similar a lot of the time, that I don't even really deserve to feel like shit because nothing particularly bad has happened to me. It's perfectly fine to feel like ass from time to time for no reason it's how you deal with it that counts. you may well hate living but it's HIGHLY unlikely that you hat everything that life has to offer. Find something you like and get balls deep into it. It'll take your mind of being sad and will most likely be a lot of fun too.  Also, you're wrong when you say you've got no one to talk to because I'm right here, buddy and my talking glands are on the verge of bursting. PM if you feel like a chat (that goes to any other person reading this and wants to talk, I really don't mind).  Do what you enjoy and try to make it through, this rough patch will be behind you soon enough and once you're out of it, you'll hardly recognise who you were when you were in it. Stay strong, friendo.
LovelyPositivity	If you ever have that feeling that you don't have any support, feel free to PM and we can talk it out.
LovelyPositivity	Well I can certainly notice one good thing about you, you know that you messed up and exactly how. This means that you can fairly easily focus on improving in future. You may feel like shit now but in the future, once you've moved past this stage in your life (perhaps found someone new) you'll be glad that you had this level of introspection.
LovelyPositivity	It sounds like the first big hurdle you've got to improving is finding an interest that you can do by yourself. For me, my life got markedly easier when I became interested in films (this was when I was about 16 and kind of miserable). I watched films everyday and learnt about films and how they're made and fucking loved it. Not only did this give me something to do, it made my life a lot more enjoyable than before and the vast knowledge and passion I gained made me a much more interesting person.  Now I'm not suggesting you start watching films because that may not be where passion lies. If you don't have anything that you're passionate about you've got to try things until you find something. Preferably something you can do on your own, that will improve you as a person and that you enjoy.  This may not seem to link to someone loving you but I assure it does. What most people overlook is that you've got should be able to spend time with yourself before you expect someone else to spend time with you. (And here's another tip: learning to enjoy your own company is always going to be more important than enjoying the company others since you're with yourself literally all the time).  So for now focus on getting some interests and, crucially, something that you're passionate about. Worry about other people afterwards.  Hope this helps.
LovelyPositivity	**I just posted this in another thread but I think it answers your "Why the fuck should I care" question.**  Whenever I see this question asked (I'm on this sub fairly often so I see it asked quite frequently), I think of [this scene from Woody Allen's Manhattan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTQ4a3BR5c).  I subscribe to the same thinking as Allen here. He lists what he personally would miss if he were no longer alive, the things that he's passionate about: jazz, Swedish films and the people he truly loves. Obviously, this sort of thing is highly personal, ironically, if I were to make a similar list, Woody Allen would be on it. I'd hate to miss out on any film Allen is going to make in the future, to not see the ones I haven't caught up on yet or to not be able to re-watch Annie Hall every six months.  My point is, you've got to find what you're passionate about be it botany, table tennis or Woody Allen films and focus on that, not whatever hardships you need to endure to experience these passions. Keep your eyes on these things and life will seem distinctly more worthwhile. You could even write them down to remind yourself if that'd help.  Hope this has helped.
LovelyPositivity	STOP
LovelyPositivity	Whenever I see this question asked (I'm on this sub fairly often so I see it asked quite frequently), I think of [this scene from Woody Allen's *Manhattan*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTQ4a3BR5c).

LovelyPositivity	It sounds to me that you need to let it all out and be yourself. You say that no girl likes you for you but you also hide behind a mask at work. The way out here is a middle ground. You definitely don't need to awkwardly shove all your issues on to your colleagues but you also shouldn't hide them all either. I assume a lot of the reason you see your therapist as being so good is that she allows you to talk and be yourself to another human. There's no need to close yourself off outside of that though. Most (good) people are more than happy to listen to your problems and will be sympathetic to you (on top of this, people get quite flattered when you confide in them (even if it's just a little thing) and that'll improve whatever relationship you have with them so you can get more support from them and have a good friend which always helps).   On your physical concerns, I think it's misunderstood just how shite war is. Anyone who isn't scared of a fight is an insane person (the fight or flight response is a physical, evolutionary beneficial reaction and certainly nothing to be ashamed of). In terms of weight, you shouldn't beat yourself up about it. [I calculated your BMI](https://i.imgur.com/nldQDet.png) and you're actually the ideal weight for a 5'11 guy your age.  This is long and rambling now so I'll get to the point. I think you'd see a lot of progress if you found something that you can just shut your brain of and enjoy. It could be [Japanese wrestling](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x481a7o) (this seems right up your alley by the way (and it really gave me something to get excited about (also if you do get into it, which I recommend, come join us at /r/SquaredCircle for some light hearted discussion))), action movies or fucking barbershop quartets. Just something to get you out of your own head and out of this downward spiral of thinking that you've got. Trust me, it'll help.  Hope you found this post helpful and I REALLY hope you watched that match because it's fucking awesome.
LovelyPositivity	Alright dude, you can do this. Remember that fundamentals: make sure that you're sleeping enough, eating enough and shitting enough. Actually fuck the last one! Shit when you feel like (but always before a test). Fundamentals are key, no matter how hard you study, you're not going to be able to retain the information or recall and apply if you're not functioning properly. So your health is  paramount here (I fucked this up myself so I know).  Also FUCK those people for misjudging you. After you graduate, which you likely will with those fundamentals in check since you sound like you DO study quite hard, you'll have a degree than you roll up into a tube and piss on their faces through it. Actually don't do that but you can very well get a job with it. But seriously, don't take what they say to heart, they probably don't know what you're going through and likely aren't acting with any malice. If this hasn't made you feel any better, here's a haiku:  It'll all work out,  Just do what you can with time,  PISS ON THEIR FACES!  Anyways, good luck.
LovelyPositivity	PM me dude, what's on your mind?
LovelyPositivity	This is your decision but I'm willing to bet that you'd benefit from doing something different. Climb a mountain, visit South East Asia, enter a speed eating contest and eat an ungodly amount of hot dogs; it's up to you. Even if you think you won't be able afford to travel or climbing a mountain, just setting this goal to save money to the point that you can do it will energise you and give a achievable goal to look forward to completing.  Seriously anything, I'm getting wanderlust just writing this. Ever wanted to stroll around Paris and check out the Louvre (I've been, it's great)? Save up and go. Ever wanted to go to Borneo and check out some orangutans and shit (I've been, it's great)? Save up and go.  You're the perfect age for this as well. Old enough that don't need to give a fuck what your parents think and not too old that your body will be against the idea of you climbing a mountain. And, in your travels, you might find something that you want to do later on. Please do this.  Hope this helps your decision. Also, please message me back if you decide on something because I got so damn pumped writing this that I really need some payoff.
LovelyPositivity	Oh I get this way sometimes, usually when I haven't had enough sleep. I'll be chatting with friends one second and the next I'm totally zoned out and staring into space. It's not as dramatic as it sounds but what I feel helps is to concentrate as hard as you can on what you are doing. If you're not doing anything, find something to do and really focus on it (try and make that thing not video games if you're worried about an addiction to it. This may sound condescending but you should read a good book and really focus on it, picture the scene in your head; I used to hate reading before I made a concerted effort to picture everything that is written down, now reading's an absolute blast and has shown a vast improvement in my literacy and communication skills -- I can recommend some good books if you like).  But yeah, I get that feeling a lot. Try and sleep more, focus on whatever is at hand.
LovelyPositivity	Yeah, I've been there. I guess feeling dumb is relative. I can't remember who said this but I think it's a great rule to live by, "we can only try to be better than the past versions of ourselves".   As long as I feel that I'm smarter or more mature or more sensible than myself in the past, then I'm satisfied. If you keep improving, you're doing all you can. Hope it helps :)  Edit: I found the quote:  “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self." - Ernest Hemingway (trust Hemingway, the dude was awesome).
LovelyPositivity	No problem, bud.
LovelyPositivity	So, I have 3 siblings who are all great people and successful in different ways. My eldest brother is unassumingly intelligent (Masters degree in Chemistry) and charismatic, my other brother is really independent and seems to have things figured out better than most adults I know and my younger sister is pretty damn good at everything.  Something that really put perspective was finding out how much my eldest brother hated his Chemistry course when he was doing it. There are very few times in my life that I've actually seen him upset but in regards to this degree, he felt he made a mistake by taking it.  This is a long response but my point is that I had no idea that he was struggling until talking to him about this just because I had never really seen him fail at anything; I couldn't fathom him being upset like this. You're always going to be your worst critic mainly because you know more about your life than other people's. Your sister may have failed at a great many thing but you just don't know about it.  I hope this helps. If you want to talk about anything, feel free to PM me, you seem really interesting and I'd love to help.
LovelyPositivity	The best thing to do here is to recognise your mistake and work to resolve it. The key now is to sort all the things that have gone wrong. Come clean about the lying most importantly. If you make a point of being entirely truthful in the future, things will be much easier.  It's not going to be easy for you in the near future but PLEASE be strong. In all likelihood (and I know this may be hard to believe) in ten years time, you'll be happy and this will be a bad memory but for the time being, you're gonna have to endure some pretty heavy talks. Trust me, you can work through it though.  Also, on your point of being a worthless human being, I can tell from what you've written that that isn't true. Worthless people don't care if they disappoint people. Worthless people don't have friends because people don't like them. You've made a mistake, literally everybody makes mistakes. Now is the time for you to sort this one out. It'll be tough but trust me, there are good times beyond this.  Send me a private message if you need someone to talk it over with. Stay strong, buddy.
LovelyPositivity	Try forcing yourself to laugh at things. When you look at yourself and want to disappear just start laughing. The more maniacal and ridiculous the better and get animated, soon enough you'll be genuinely laughing and you won't feel so blue anymore. Works like a charm for me. If you want to talk through stuff about your boyfriend, feel free to send me a private message. It'll get better, friendo.
LovelyPositivity	Perhaps this is just a sign that you need to go balls out on rekindling this friendship. Shoot a genuine compliment at him, tell him how much you cherished your friendship and I guarantee he'll be interested in chatting more. By next year, you could even invite him to do something however big or small you may want it to be and then there's no way he'll forget it. :)
LovelyPositivity	Talking to someone about this stuff is always helpful even if just to rationalise all the problems in your head and get a second opinion. I'd really appreciate it if you could private message. Please don't do anything to hurt yourself.
LovelyPositivity	I've had this feeling a little recently as well. Just feeling stranded despite having people who are there and care about me. I've found the best way to make friends is to join groups. There are groups for literally every activity. Find one for something you already enjoy or something that seems interesting and just put yourself out there. A quote that has always helped me goes something like, 'the best things in life lie just outside your comfort zone'.  Sorry to ramble but I really hope this helps. I'm open to hash it out a bit more if you want to send me a direct message. I'm here for you, friendo.
LovelyPositivity	Remember that the night is darkest just before the dawn. Think through what you DO have and are grateful and cling on to them. Vent to your wife, I'm sure she'd be open to listening if you express your feelings. Stay strong, friendo, you can get through this.

FrankWest21CP	The buff to the base pallet breaking speed was huge. Recently-prestiged killers wont be looped so hard anymore, and Brutal Strength is no longer *as* required as it was anymore.  A very good change all around, I say!
FrankWest21CP	Just wait for his wild swinging to end and then jump out. If you time it right you'll just lose a health state.
FrankWest21CP	Leatherface is a completely new killer. What OP meant by "mini-killer" is that Leatherface was released all by himself with no map or survivor. 
FrankWest21CP	Switching targets is a bad idea as the new guy will just resume the pallet looping. Might as well burn all the pallets with the first guy.
FrankWest21CP	Overwhelming Presence is so incredible now. If every killer used it, flashlights would be in total RIP mode. Combine that with Leatherface's item drop perk and I think we can declare the flashlight meta to be over.
FrankWest21CP	More like a worse Hillbilly who is easier to play.
FrankWest21CP	Survivors are way more powerful than the killer and thus most people give up playing killer. Even with all the killer buffs today I'm pretty sure that survivors still have the edge.
FrankWest21CP	"waaaah I cant instablind the killer as easily anymore"
FrankWest21CP	What powers are available in Original Game +?
FrankWest21CP	Did you seriously just harass me via PM? How juvenile are you?
FrankWest21CP	There's a built-in ping tool now?!
FrankWest21CP	Can anyone confirm if mori-ing one of the main 4 survs in a pub match gives you their face as a cosmetic?
FrankWest21CP	Did you figure out how to unlock the extra leatherface masks?
FrankWest21CP	*mouth foams and body convulses*  (I recommend using the Announcement flair)
FrankWest21CP	Knock Out- Downed survivor auras cannot be seen by fellow survivors if they are not within a certain range  Barbecue and Chili- After hooking a survivor, the auras of survivors beyond a certain range are revealed for four seconds. In addition, all score events pay out double bp so long as someone is on a hook.  Forgot the name- Hitting survivors makes them drop their items and damages the item
FrankWest21CP	He's great! I can't wait to figure out how to get those extra masks. He's got the power of the hillbilly but is not nearly as mobile. He'll suck at patrolling, but he's great at chasing.
FrankWest21CP	It also seems to double the points for the initial hook as well. 
FrankWest21CP	If survivors can jump off my back and stun me for a year, I think it's okay if I can see distant auras after hooking someone.
FrankWest21CP	Leatherface can wear the faces of survivors somehow. It's in his mask customization, but it's locked. | title
FrankWest21CP	I think that Barbecue and Chili is the killer equivalent of WGLF | With the perk, all scoring events pay DOUBLE so long as at least one dude is hooked. Combine that with seeing the auras of distant survivors after hooking someone and you got yourself a cool perk.  Thank you devs <3
FrankWest21CP	Holy crap, I did NOT expect them to release a paid DLC with basically no warning.  This is super cool! It is interesting that the Hillbilly's inspiration is now a killer himself.
FrankWest21CP	My guess is that you must mori the corresponding survivors in a pub game. 
FrankWest21CP	I love these salty survivor mains.
FrankWest21CP	I am really liking this new killer. He's got the power of the Billy in a more easily controlled fashion, but the extra mobility is absent.
FrankWest21CP	That is my guess!   It's gonna feel good wearing Meg's smug, stupid little face on myself.
FrankWest21CP	Does hitting a survivor while standing still not negate insidious? If so, I might have found my new favorite perk 
FrankWest21CP	What if the killer just stands next to you and waits for the hooks to grow back?
FrankWest21CP	Well, if a survivor escapes from a hook when the gems are done and borrowed time makes it impossible to get them, it ruins my fun as the killer.
FrankWest21CP	Yet survivors are likely still more powerful. 
FrankWest21CP	>Find survivor  > pallet loop   > pallet loop  > pallet loop  > pallet loop   > building loop  > pallet loop  > pallet loop  > pallet loop  > shack loop  > pallet loop  > finally down him  > his swf buddies flashlight me as I pick him up  > see beginning
FrankWest21CP	Nah, man, you need a GUI Interface in order to track it. Just a plain old GUI will get you nowhere.
FrankWest21CP	The flashlight plays triggered me (killer main), but the video was well-done. Nice music choice, too!
FrankWest21CP	I read WashPo's review of Beef Side's book(adblock was enabled). There was so much cringe. Hillary still believes that the media was more on Trump's side than her side (lolwat) and she also partially credits her loss to sexism still. There was even a part where the article lamented over how people call Hillary and Pocahontas unlikeable because they're women. Unbelievable.
FrankWest21CP	I hate it when survivors think they're being so skillful when they loop around pallets and buildings. My dead grandmother could do it.
FrankWest21CP	I wanna try to predict how the match went based on the scoreboard.  I'm thinking that the killer spread herself too thin and tried to trap every generator, as noob Hags do. The rank 20 tripped a trap pretty quickly and the Hag just happened to be in teleport range. The Hag then proceeded to do a hard camping patrol. The three of you ~~farmed~~ attempted to rescue the survivor, but the kill was ultimately achieved. Due to a combination of looping and knowledge of the fact that duck walking negates the phantasm traps, you all were able to evade the Hag and win the match.
FrankWest21CP	Luck Be My Lady   Up the Ante, Ace in the Hole, Plunderer's Instinct, Slippery Meat(must be tier 3)
FrankWest21CP	If you're on steam, every dlc but one is half off.
FrankWest21CP	Don't remove the anniversary items; increase their rarities instead! | I love the anniversary items. They help with the grind and it is always a joy to pop one or see one popped. I get that the fact that they're uncommon and common offerings makes it so that the grind is sorta thrown out of whack and items like the wreathes become useless in comparison, so why not just up the rarities and keep them? The pudding and cake can be made purple, and the streamers can be pink. That way they scale properly with the other bloodpoint-boosting items and become a bit harder to get.
FrankWest21CP	Check the store page for DBD.
FrankWest21CP	It is released as dlc, though?
FrankWest21CP	Intentionally avoid getting the two sacrifices required to safety pip. Slug everyone after getting like two hooks in(let them go). You only get one victory point if someone bleeds out on the ground, so don't worry about slugging too much.  You can also backup your save, delete your save, load into the game, exit the game, and restore your backup. That'll get you to rank 20.
FrankWest21CP	*prepares seven dollars to throw at the screen Huntress-style*
FrankWest21CP	I'm getting myself all hyped up again | It has been over a month since Lullaby released. The devs have leaked not one but TWO of the next killer's teachable perks. The achievements for the new DLC have been added for a while now. That Russian community mod person said that the next "global" patch is coming sooner than we think. I don't think the softban update was that update as Glorious Pretty Good Job So Far Man and his non-royalty sidekick noted that the softbans will take a while to come to console.   The time for a new DLC is nigh, and I'm hyped up! The trailer could even drop tomorrow! :D   ormaybeitscominginlikethreeweeksandimhypingmyselftooearly
FrankWest21CP	I fully agree. The grind needs a fixin'. Especially when there are so many new characters to play as and level up.
FrankWest21CP	Sad Cabinet
FrankWest21CP	/u/mcote_bhvr, I can't wait to throw another seven dollars at you! This game is my daily sustenance.
FrankWest21CP	When you hit a survivor to the ground, his friends can't see his aura until they get close to him.
FrankWest21CP	*A dramatic representation of why this idea wouldn't work too well*  SWF Buddy One: Hey, man, is that you walking towards me?  SWF Buddy Two: Nah, I'm on a genny next to the barn.  SWF Buddy One: The killer is disguised as One, guys!  SWF Buddies Three and Four: Roger that!
FrankWest21CP	[softbans intensify]
FrankWest21CP	Killers have the right to refuse service. If I don't want to deal with a flashlight SWF BM squad, I don't have to.
FrankWest21CP	I think it covers everything.
FrankWest21CP	I think you're just unlucky or inefficient at stealth.
FrankWest21CP	If I could take you up to paradise up above...
FrankWest21CP	The donut gets larger and wider. I haven't used those add-ons with the tape, though.
FrankWest21CP	You don't need to look THAT far away. Just a little to the left or right. Survivors aren't used to juking the donut shape, so you'll hit them pretty often. 
FrankWest21CP	All you really have to do is aim to the left or the right when hitting a survivor in front of you. I hit plenty of shocks my first time using the add-on.
FrankWest21CP	It looks like he's about to make a FINGERGUN with his left hand
FrankWest21CP	CLEAN UP.....REGISTER SIX!
FrankWest21CP	imho it sounds more like Pisces
FrankWest21CP	*Shadowborn cries in a corner*
FrankWest21CP	This literal exact situation happened to one of my random survivor teammates. It was even on coldwind, too. 
FrankWest21CP	Since Bethesda is publishing it, expect the reviews after the release.
FrankWest21CP	Backrubs being able to heal extreme injury: Fine  Chainsaws not wounding victims to the point of no possible immediate recovery: Fine  Magic bells that make you invisible: Fine  Magic breath that makes you teleport: Fine  Mud triangles that magically spawn clones of yourself: Fine  Bear trap victims being able to walk and run completely fine afterward: Fine  People who got hit in the back of the head with a hatchet being able to walk and run completely fine: Fine  Staring at survivors to magically boost your power: Fine  Shooting electricity out of your hand: Fine  A revolver being inaccurate: NOT FINE
FrankWest21CP	Dad get off reddit
FrankWest21CP	I give survivors who do it a .2 second headstart starting from the moment they start the kobe animation.
FrankWest21CP	I hate this stupid "If it's not realistic it's terrible" argument. Should the Hillbilly instamori people he chainsaws? Should the Huntress instamori people who she hits square in the head with her hatchets? Should Michael have no special ability because staring at people doesn't make you stronger in real life?
FrankWest21CP	Something small that I really like about Philip | His foot doesn't partially miss the generator when he kicks it from the front or back. You'd think the other killers would learn, but nooooo
FrankWest21CP	So you're fine with some stuff being unrealistic for the sake of gameplay but other stuff MUST be COMPLETELY TRUE TO LIFE or it's terrible? How inconsistent of you.
FrankWest21CP	If you care the most about nabbing great teachables, go with the Trapper. BS and Agi are A+
FrankWest21CP	itsavideogame
FrankWest21CP	I just had the most glorious poop in a while. | I've been having intestinal issues all my life. I most likely have IBS. About a week ago I decided to try out a probiotic and see if it would do anything. After the poop I just had, I think it is.   All the number 2 that was clogging up my colon came out. It ended with some uncomfortable white-hot diarrhea, but the pain subsided and gave way to pure bliss. Life is good. I like living.
FrankWest21CP	Teachables do not ever go away until you learn them.
FrankWest21CP	Idea for Hexes: Delayed activation | Part of the reason why Hexes are not extremely viable is because they can spawn right in front of the survivors and get torn apart in seconds.   With that in mind, I thought of a solution: Delayed Activation.  When you enter a game with at least one hex equipped, none of the totems are lit nor is(are) the hex(ex) active. At any point during the trial, you can hit the E key (or the console comparative) to light your totems and activate the hexes. If there are not enough dull totems left for all your hexes, the game will randomly pick the ones that will be activated. If no dull totems remain, then nothing will activate.   NOED works somewhat differently. If you choose to light your totems before the generators are all done, then NOED will remain off. Once the generators are done, you may once again push the activation key whenever you like to activate NOED so long as a dull totem remains. You could in theory down someone, hook him, and then activate NOED when the rescuers come.  I believe this change would protect your hexes from instantly being broken as the survivors have no way to tell if you have any until you decide to activate them. Choosing the best moment to activate them will also add a greater level of thoughtfulness to killer gameplay.   I also have another idea for Devour Hope and Huntress Lullaby, two hexes that work on a token system. Perhaps even when you haven't activated them yet, the perks will still accumulate tokens. So when you do activate them, you'll get the powered up version. This could be too much, though, so that's why I separated it from my main suggestion.
FrankWest21CP	When I play killer, the final survivor finds the hatch in .2 nanoseconds. When I am the final survivor, I search for several minutes, get chased for a couple, and die without ever finding it.
FrankWest21CP	inb4 dlc comes this week
FrankWest21CP	inb4 they make a perk that does that
z3r0_d4y	Thanks.. It just doesn't seem worth it to continue, you know? It seems I feel worse each day, and it's hard to imagine ever feeling better
z3r0_d4y	Please somebody out there, talk to me | I'm so close to giving up. It takes all my energy not to... I can't do this anymore. 
z3r0_d4y	constant pain now, not sure how much longer i can hold on | it's really hard to keep going.
z3r0_d4y	not anymore thankfully..
z3r0_d4y	me too man! it's everybody joking about it makes the people who actually have it kind of dismissed
z3r0_d4y	"you should just kill yourself" from a friend..
z3r0_d4y	Had an amazing dream | I had a dream where i was happy, not just faking it or having something at the back of my mind gnawing at me, I was actually just happy. It felt so good... I realized i actually forgot what real happiness feels like, and how much i miss it. I feel like i'm going crazy. 
z3r0_d4y	so lonely, please help | I'm so fucking lonely, ive never told anyone about my depression irl, not even my family, and whenever i tell one of my online friends that i'm not feeling good i feel so guilty, they shouldn't have to worry about me! It's so much easier to keep it inside but it makes me feel so lonely  and tired... 
z3r0_d4y	Hi I'm depressed nice to meet you lol
z3r0_d4y	eyyy 
z3r0_d4y	So lonely it hurts.. | I want to tell people how i feel, i want help but i dont want anybody to worry about me... I feel guilty when people worry, im not worth that!
z3r0_d4y	Yes!! And it's so peaceful, listening to music!
z3r0_d4y	Hey man, if you need to talk feel free to pm me. Stay strong. 
z3r0_d4y	When I feel scared i listen to music, it always makes me feel better. Listening to music while falling asleep is my favorite part of the day..
z3r0_d4y	Homeschooled here as well. If your parents won't make any kind of schedule you can always make your own, try some free online classes, do something you're interested in! I'd say the best thing to get you prepared for school is deadlines. Try setting deadlines for yourself, even for small tasks, it will really help you in the future.
z3r0_d4y	Yea man, I was such a dick to my old friends and i regret it so much.. Wish I could go back and punch myself as hard as i could in the face. 
z3r0_d4y	Holy shit man. Thank you so much!! You exactly described what it's like, and thank you so much for the advice. I'd say I'm staying pretty healthy physically, but to be honest, going outside and/or exercising doesn't help my mood at all. Some days are just better than others and I really don't know why. This comment definitely made me feel a lot better though, again, thank you so much for taking the time out to help me. I hope you feel better soon, and if you some cheering up feel free to PM me. I've been told I'm pretty good at it. Good luck in life, hope it all works out for you <3
z3r0_d4y	Depression vs anxiety | I feel anxiety during the day and depression at night and i don't know which is worse.
z3r0_d4y	No! Don't do it! Even if you don't get in there are so many more opportunities in life. Don't give up.
z3r0_d4y	That's awesome. I've never told anybody irl and I don't think I'll ever have the guts to.
z3r0_d4y	I feel like if I had someone to hug IRL I would be so much happier | Too bad I can't even tell my family about my depression...
z3r0_d4y	I feel the exact same way. Only thing keeping me going is friends, I guess..
z3r0_d4y	Yea, they are sooo annoying!
z3r0_d4y	too late
z3r0_d4y	Thank you (:
z3r0_d4y	I don't deserve my friends.. | They're so nice and patient.. I know I hurt them when I'm depressed so I just lie and say everything's fine, which makes me hate myself even more.
z3r0_d4y	I don't even remember when it started.... I guess it started when I realized how worthless I am
z3r0_d4y	Anyone else beat themselves over tiny things? | No matter how small or long ago they were, I can't forgive myself for anything. I hate myself so much.
z3r0_d4y	A movie reel you can't turn off.
z3r0_d4y	I mess everything up, i feel like everything is my fault, which it probably is..
z3r0_d4y	Oh god yes, the guilt is the worst, why can't I just feel good about getting better?!
z3r0_d4y	Don't do it!!
z3r0_d4y	it sucks.
z3r0_d4y	Ignorance really is bliss..
z3r0_d4y	Yea, I totally get that, i overthink just about everything. And hey, fellow coder :) nice to meet you.
z3r0_d4y	Same here.. 
z3r0_d4y	Try /r/SuicideWatch. Goodluck out there man, I hope you make it through.
z3r0_d4y	yay :) 
z3r0_d4y	Try making a schedule for yourself, always getting up before a specific time no matter what. Eventually you'll get accustomed to it and you won't even need an alarm.
z3r0_d4y	I'm trying.
z3r0_d4y	Don't be like that
z3r0_d4y	Good luck (: hope you can find some better friends, cliques really suck, don't they..
z3r0_d4y	I don't know.. I guess I do it for my friends. And in the back of my head there's something that wont let me stop
z3r0_d4y	I'm happy to help, if you want to talk to me (:
z3r0_d4y	I can talk to you if you want. (:
z3r0_d4y	Anyone else get cold when they are really sad? | The kind of cold that comes from the inside, that wont go away no matter how many hot showers you take or blankets you put on.
z3r0_d4y	Coding, hacking and listening to music. I can tune everything else out and feel okay for a while.
z3r0_d4y	I'm scared | Im scared that I'm going to lose my online friends. My parents don't want me to have them and they think that they are the reason I am sad, but they are actually the ones that have kept me alive. I don't know what to do or if I can do anything.. It makes me feel so helpless and alone
z3r0_d4y	You should start learning - it's fun and a good way to escape
z3r0_d4y	My friends, for always being there.. I don't understand how anyone has the patience to deal with me but they do..
z3r0_d4y	You're a good person. (:
z3r0_d4y	no. i was a weak jerk. I guess I'm not really a jerk anymore though so, progress, I guess.
z3r0_d4y	Same here! It's like I'm so used to feeling so bad that I'll never be happy again.....
z3r0_d4y	I don't have lots of life experience and I don't know if I have good advice but I can talk to you if you want..
z3r0_d4y	Well that's good i guess.. Thanks man.
z3r0_d4y	Friends.. Even if I lie and say I'm ok it still helps. I don't deserve them..
z3r0_d4y	Anyone else feel guilty for feeling better? | Somedays I honestly feel better but then I just feel guilty..
z3r0_d4y	Code, hack, listen to music and tune *everything* else out.

ElectricalOYAP	I just wanna cry | My life sucks. I have no bright future, im poor and im ugly. I'm so alone and sad and my family is in pieces. I got so depressed today that I social media stalked my ex from 3 years ago (when I was in highschool) and found out she's now engaged. I miss her..she was the only relationship I ever had. Isn't that sad?   I don't get sleep at night because my brain doesn't shut off. I'm ruined mentally because of my family problems and I have no solution for it.  My stepmom is suicidal, my sister ran away from home and my dad is about to go to prison for assault. We have no money, no savings and my stepmom is mentally ruined....  I don't know why I wrote this out but I thought it would help. I have a migraine   Help me

ElectricalOYAP	Best seats in Ricoh Coliseum? | I'm trying to get 3 tickets for the next Marlies home game. I've never been to the Ricoh Coliseum so my question is what are the best seats in the house? Any advice? 
ElectricalOYAP	You DO go to school for each of your yearly exams until you're licensed. Here in Canada it's a 10 week course which is usually covered by your company and you claim unemployment. You have to do an apprenticeship program which is split 80% work(on job training) and 20% schooling. Finding a company that will take you on is your first step and the hardest.   Currently an apprentice in the province of Ontario.
ElectricalOYAP	Or pulling teck cables for service panels lol
ElectricalOYAP	So I graduated from high school just last year and have friends that went to arts schools (ESA and Cardinal Carter) so I can give some insight.  Arts schools DO have a higher percentage of wealthier white students. At ESA and Rosedale there's about a 1:4 male to female ratio. White parents are just more likely to be open to having thier kids do arts and arts program and can afford it whereas other cultures and less wealthy parents would rather their kids go into more academic (STEM) programs. Not in any discriminatory way but when you're white and rich you can kind of be carefree about what you do in high school and post secondary because your parents will back you up no matter what you do. Other cultures are just different. Obviously this isn't true for every rich and white students but speaking specifically about arts programs, that's just how it is.  My closest asian friends who were equally wealthy were still more inclined to go into STEM fields and the ones that did attend arts programs were in graphic and computer arts (not in arts programs like Theatre and dance where there's a higher percentage of white students).   Again nothing racist or discriminatory but it's just the way it is lol.   
ElectricalOYAP	I graduated from high school just last year and my friends sister went to ESA ( Etobicoke school of the Arts) and the male to Female ratio is about 1:4. There are waay more girls then dudes at these schools. Granted, white chicks are way more likely to apply to arts schools. Same with RSA and Cardinal Carter. Schools that aren't even specified arts schools but have better arts programs are also like that.
happydude-	Depression brought on by happiness? | Hi, a few years ago i became depresses brought on by stress. After many months i eventually went to a doctor who prescribed zolof (could be spelled differently, not sure), i dont want to say it made me suicidal but it made me think about alot dispite it nevr bein a thought, since then i can almost feel that it altered something ( havnt taken it in 2 years), almost like it changed the chemistry in my brain and that my thought patterns are not the same...i have not felt down in a while as inworked my steady job and lived my regular routine, but what i noticed is that in times that i feel genuinely happy due to dating a girl i like or playing well with my football team, i seem to crash after into a pit of depression...the only time this happens is after a spell of being happier than normal. Anyone else ever felt/ noticed this?
happydude-	Relapse in times of happiness? | [removed]
Incendance	Sorry if this is all over the place I tried to clean it up the best I could but, this is just a shitty situation that's all over the place.
Incendance	My friend's dad told her to kill herself | So my girlfriend's friend texted her about 30 minutes ago about how her parents just beat the shit out of her and kicked her out so I went to go pick her up to bring her back to my girlfriend's house. At the moment, we're at my girlfriend's house and her friend is talking to us about what's happened throughout the day. Her dad basically said "if you're thinking about killing yourself just do it already.", and he also hit her a couple of times after forcing himself into her room while she's changing (she's here without any undergarments, just a loose cloth dress), and they kick her out. She tells us that he was basically trying to guilt her into not killing herself, "it's crazy that you would want to kill yourself after I didn't kill you in the womb." Sorry if this is all over the place i'm just trying to relay the severity of the situation and I really want some help about how to help her with this situation. She can't stay at my girlfriend's house because at the moment she has nothing but the dress she has on and her phone, and her parents expect her home by 5 today (about 30 minutes from now) for dinner at their friends' house. Any help is appreciated.

Incendance	Azir because making flashy plays never gets old and always feels great, also he scales like a monster as long as you don't feed in lane
Incendance	I generally agree with you on these types of things, but this is a different case. Jr. here payed the reserve so that he could hunt the infertile elephant which was driving off fertile elephants. Even though he is, in the end, killing an elephant, he is also in a way saving other elephants on this reserve by giving the reserve money directly and killing off an infertile elephant which would not have contributed towards saving the endangered species, and may have contributed towards its downfall due to it driving off fertile elephants as I mentioned before.
Incendance	Yes.

Incendance	You're right, it isn't. Are you trying to deny that a pro game and soloq are completely different, where one is playing for fun and self satisfaction and the other is a job with money and other prizes on the line?
Incendance	Same dude
Incendance	Fuck.
Incendance	It's a legacy skin so it's only available during lunar revel. I'm pretty sure legacy skins don't get early sales but don't quote me on that
Incendance	Not trying to get involved in the conversation as I don't know may informstion on the case or anything legal but for future reference, say "not guilty" instead of innocent. Not guilty accounts for any possible errors in court that could've been overlooked or any new evidence that comes before the court (AFAIK).

Incendance	I would get orange as I haven't tried any key switches with a tactile click and I would like to. The linear one doesn't appeal to me as much since I don't really care about the shorter travel time, and I game in a relatively open environment so click wouldn't be as good for me.
Incendance	My hybrid assassin tristana begs to differ
Incendance	I've tried it in practice and I'm pretty sure the passive doesn't proc with soldiers, correct me if I'm wrong. Even if it did proc, that gold could be used towards a void staff which is just straight up better as it gives % mpen and also gives ap.
Incendance	Building berzerkers and rylais every game without going liandries. Also using both soldiers to farm every wave without keeping one stored
Incendance	:)
Incendance	Currently B1 shitter, and people just don't know how to play against ryze, they walk up in lane while I have an e on a minion and take a load of damage all at once, and rinse and repeat
Incendance	Cool, thanks!
Incendance	Edge of night also gets canceled by any damage taken or on ability cast (correct me if I'm wrong on the second part) so they really can't be compared.
Incendance	Damn can't counter that
Incendance	How would you feel about morello and nashors? I love the mana and ap I get from morello and the 40% CDR relatively early with nashors and morello fees pretty sweet
Incendance	yup forgot about about that
Incendance	Right now I go 50/50 between WK and gravelord, never use the same skin 2 games in a row intentionally. I like the look of WK but I don't feel like it fits for every game so I trade.
Incendance	He's talking from the PoV of a Shaco, Shaco isn't immobile but he thinks he's hot shit because he's ganging an immobile champion and gets a kill.
Incendance	Hey, I'm just trying to clarify what the other guy said
Incendance	Don't worry about it, we all have those moments
Incendance	Yeah liandry's sounds a lot more appealing than rageblade, completely forgot about the % max health burn, and it wouldn't need to be stacked either. Pretty nice
Incendance	Rageblade against heavy tank? | How do you guys feel about building a rageblade against teams that have a lot of tanks? I haven't had a game with more than one tank recently so I couldnt really justify trying it, but I know that azir's soldiers proc the passive. Thoughts?
Incendance	It is though...
Incendance	Strange, on the [official announcement page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/lunar-revel-bundles-legacy-skins) it's listed as legacy.  EDIT: Just sorted skins by limited availability and it is listed under them for me https://gyazo.com/1e55e96c591d29e090ed41ac9b2ef8ab
Incendance	It is, on the official announcement page it is listed as legacy and it shows up when sorting skins by "limited availability."
Incendance	Nope unfortunately, it is a legacy skin so it isn't going to be in the shop permanently
Incendance	MY RIGHT ARM IS A LOT STRONGER THAN MY LEFT ARM
Incendance	Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated?
Incendance	I'm not too experienced with a azir, but I've been playing exclusively azir mid lane for the past 20 ish games and going DRing+stinger>morello>nashor>berserkers>rylais>deathcap/void staff>whatever you might need has worked well. I really enjoy the early spike in damage that comes from morello and not having to worry as much about mana when poking in lane. The 40% CDR from nashor and morello also feels great to have earlier on in the game.
Incendance	I mained vel for a couple of weeks and had fun with him. Once, I forgot to back during lane phase and was just able to roam around the map getting kills with just a doran's ring and level advantage, it was great.
Incendance	Twat
Incendance	Did you know if you try to comment your Reddit password it just shows asterisks? Look!      ********  /s
Incendance	This Y isn't on the same line as the rest of the word | 
Incendance	PSA: Project items such as augment caches and project cores expire on November 7th (PST) | The project items that were used to hype up the new project skins a month or two ago will stop being available on November 6th 23:59 PST. Even though they're only worth 2 orange essence (riot why), you might as well disenchant them to get something from them.
Incendance	I spent exactly $30, I also started playing this season so it's not as impressive but w/e
Incendance	When he used his e on a minion and q'd it, it spread to other minions without the first minion dying. [Basically this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nNTEo0_PUg)
Incendance	Instantly clear a huge wave with new ryze, e the minion that is at the tiniest sliver of health, and watch it spread throughout the entire wave. Then you just need to a once and the entire wave has evaporated.
Incendance	Tom Scott has a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCSUmwP02T8&ab_channel=TomScott) on this river. He's pretty cool and does a bunch of similar stuff.
Incendance	Ah, that's does seem pretty stupid. I haven't tried it much in game except for half a dm this morning, my mistake.
Incendance	How can adding cosmetic sprays into the game p2w? It's really just for aesthetic purposes AFAIK.
Incendance	Did the same thing a couple of months ago with some friends of mine, and I honestly don't regret it. Every time valve releases a new update it just makes me more and more satisfied with my decision. It seems like they want for people to quit at this point.
Incendance	Percent maximum health as true damage scaling with AD  Dash with potential 2 second cooldown  Blocks every ability in the game and potentially stuns opponent  Guaranteed critical strike  Up to 20% maximum health true damage on ult that gives more than 50% of health back after killing the enemy.
Incendance	Now we know why Tom Scott is always wearing red shirts
Incendance	2001 https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=182460825&token=ouYTyE-0 Thanks OP!
Incendance	Alright thanks for letting me know! I wasn't completely sure because my friends have said the same sort of thing and haven't been able to figure it out either.
Incendance	But in this case the fnatic org would be fucked. They currently have the best players in the world, and to fire them would lose them a considerable chunk of money. If you're being told to clean something, chances are you're easily replaceable, but being the best player in the world is no easy feat.
Incendance	u/colorizerbot
Incendance	But in my past life I was a flapperpaddle and if you refuse to honor that then you're triggering me and I'll have to call the special unit of transgendered police after you to make you check your privilege, shitlord.
Incendance	I'm taking this.
Incendance	If you have snapchat installed you can use that to edit photos quickly without a watermark
Incendance	No, next time you're curious check out r/amishadowbanned
Incendance	eggsD
Incendance	I recognize the profile picture of the top-left player. Not surprised in the slightest that they were vacced
Incendance	Didn't see the above statement, I was browsing through the comments and saw you ask it twice, didn't think to look at the context.
Incendance	A special snowflake is basically someone who tries to make themselves as special and unique as possible, usually in the form of things that don't make any sense, aren't humanly possible, or both. Usually things like otherkin (believing that you belong in a completely different SPECIES) or being a 3rd wave feminist.
Incendance	2001  Thanks Men((((
Incendance	!RemindMe 48 hours
Incendance	I have a similar knife and I'm also curious of the price.
Incendance	But Prime MM so it's all good
Incendance	Same here, except I ranked up once instead of twice.
Incendance	Everyone is comparing it to emerald, does anyone have a screenshot of an emerald? I haven't seen one yet.
Incendance	I'm assuming that he was complaining about how rank 2 is too low so smurfs/hackers can get into mm much easier now. I pointed out that he doesn't need to worry about that because of prime matchmaking.
Incendance	If you're mge and posting on r/globaloffensive I'd assume that you'd be at least rank 21 by now and you'd have nothing to complain about.
Incendance	This would be good in r/unexpected
Incendance	If your case can't fit on your table then buy a new table with the money that yis ire going to get! You don't really need much other than a new graphics card, maybe a monitor or two and an SSD.
Incendance	Correct me if I'm wrong but that had a roster change right before they went on to be semifinalists (?). Could it be that?
Incendance	AFAIK max blues are cheaper, I could be wrong though. I would take a couple of people that are asking for about the same price and compare them then decide.
cloteally	:( | i don't really know how it got to this point but i don't think i can ever go back to who i was or the life i lived. i do t really remember a time in my life where i wasn't depressed or at least littered with anxiety. and i have nobody. well, i guess i have people but i don't have anyone to talk to. i don't want to be alive anymore and i don't understand why i can't kill myself, i just know i can't. medications don't work and i don't trust anyone enough to say anything in therapy. i don't know if life is for everyone.
cloteally	Bad dream? | 
cloteally	good glass, good ass
cloteally	milf
cloteally	im not crying, you're crying 
cloteally	just gettin fried with the boys today | 
cloteally	a dab a day keeps the worries away | 
cloteally	forgive me for being ignorant, but what are australia's laws on marijuana & how does the public respond to it? do a lot of people still smoke if it's illegal? is weed/concentrate easily accessible?
cloteally	holy shit that's expensive! if you ever come to america, dabs are on me. how much does weed cost then?
cloteally	nah, i'm just shit at captions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but i upvoted for creativity 
cloteally	his & hers |

cloteally	omg this happened to me! I was on prozac for a few months for anxiety/insomnia/depression and it was an absolutely a w f u l few months. i was really depressed but i couldn't even sleep so i became a zombie, essentially 0/10
cloteally	[5] i think it's too early to call it spring cleaning but | 
cloteally	I got drunk last night for the first time in a while and it reminded me why I love weed so much | I went up to a lake house and got really drunk with my childhood friends. It was a ton of fun of course, but I wish I remembered more of the night and didn't spend the past half hour on the shitter. Now i'm smoking a bowl of an illegal drug to help alleviate some of the pain of drinking a legal one.
cloteally	well i'm glad your experience was better than mine pal!
cloteally	you're definitely right! but I honestly didn't drink very much that night so the hangover felt worse because it just wasn't worth it. i rarely drink since my body doesn't handle it so kindly, but when i do any alcohol is too much alcohol lol
cloteally	nope, i forget how to breathe when i get crossfaded
cloteally	george kills lennie 
cloteally	[6] Recently invested in my first really nice bong | i am so high off of every hit and i don't even feel it in my lungs

cloteally	it really does, i'm a huge fan
cloteally	kief, and im not sure. i have intentionally not opened my grinder since i got it so that the day im really desperate and decide to, i'll have a good bit in there.
cloteally	according to the american federal government, it's just as bad as cocaine or heroin SO THIS SUBREDDIT IS FULL OF SIN
cloteally	or something like that

cloteally	i'm jealous! im trying to slow down on smoking so i can focus on my classes a little bit more, my other stoner friends can't quite believe it though lmao
cloteally	[6] My bowl looks angelic | 
cloteally	well of course
cloteally	bong rips are the best thing for a break up
cloteally	No, have a ton of munchies. Just make them all somewhat healthy. Thats what i do. Dried mango, chocolate milk, veggies, trail mix, pickles. all that shit is so BOMB baked and not awful for you.
cloteally	Do anyones else's eyes dilate to different sizes when they're high? [5] | 
cloteally	not that i know of, it's always been like this. I have countless pictures since ive started smoking of my pupils being TOTALLY different sizes, even the next day, and i've never known anyone else that has this experience.
cloteally	we've all been there, best of luck 
cloteally	my dealer claims that he is one, however i still have to wait until 11-12 to get anything

cloteally	I want help, but have always struggled with getting it. Anyone been in a similar situation? | I've had depression for a long time now and it's been severe for the past two years, but i'm finally on the edge. I can't get through the day without having some sort of total emotional breakdown. Ive always been the hyper-dependent, people pleaser type person who shows no negative emotion to anyone, so opening up about my depression and anxiety is always a shocker (and feels like a disappointment). After a recent suicide attempt, my boyfriend was really distraught and told me that I should to tell my parents so they can help, or he will. Note: my boyfriend is NOT controlling or intrusive or anything of the sort, he just wants what's best for me and i know he's right. I was on prozac over the summer and it exacerbated my insomnia, anxiety and depression, so i'm terrified of other medication doing the same or me not being open enough in therapy. Anyway, my parents are really conservative and distant and have never had a huge concern for my mental health, mostly because they don't know how crippling my mindset is. I've decided to come clean to them in the next month and i'm absolutely terrified. I'm afraid that they won't fully understand what i'm going through and dumb it down, or do the exact opposite. I hate the feeling of being fragile or dependent in the first place which is why it's taken me so long to seek help, but some things are going to be changing in my life that will break me entirely if i don't fix the issue now. I'm totally lost and confused.
cloteally	code red!! code red!!! | [removed]
cloteally	alex from target
cloteally	it was a rough night alright!
cloteally	thank you! i'm sorry if my post seems silly i am just high and confused and have never experienced this before 
cloteally	Bad Marijuana Trip? | [7] and all has been going well so i decided to get in the shower, after about 5 minutes i began hearing things and loosing my balance and feeling pains in my stomach and head. i fell out of the shower and after gaining composure, i stumbled into the kitchen. i'm shaking very hard and experiencing a lot of pain in my head and feel like there is an evil presence. what should i do?
cloteally	huh, haven't seen this "American Pie" yet
cloteally	you heard a noise and went to check? ive seen too many scary movies to preform that act of bravery 
cloteally	my culture is not your costume 
cloteally	the pharmaceutical medicine i was prescribed for being suicidal, anxious and an insomniac only exacerbated all of my problems. but a few hits in and i'm happy, relaxed and sleep with no problem, gotta love trees
cloteally	it's the motha fuckin D-O-double G
cloteally	[4] thought it was a dildo for a second 
cloteally	this is how i wanna go out
cloteally	SO IS UR-EATH-RAL WRONG?? because up until this moment i've never had to say that word but if i did i might have called someone a urethra. i am so glad i came to this revolution prior to the awkward tension.
cloteally	i'm so high i thought this said dessert burritos and i was disappointed for a second but then i realized this is equally as exciting 
cloteally	in the seventh grade, a Rude Ass Boy made a comment about how the map I had made was ugly. me, being the angsty pubescent teen I was, I immediately retorted with "Oh yeah! well your MOM is ugly!!" he sobbed hysterically and eventually went home. while I, on the other hand, felt slightly proud of such an effective burn. little did I remember, his mother was on her death bed for lung cancer and died three days later. well kids; ya win some, ya lose some, what can I say?
cloteally	can't relate
cloteally	my friend and I decided to get super baked once before going out to eat with a bunch of people. we tried to play it cool at a solid 8, and I thought we were. until I look over to see the entire table staring at him as he holds two cups of water to his mouth, trying to drink them both at the same time. after asking him what he was doing, he informs me that he has "invented double water!! it has same water taste, but with TWICE the calories." shortly after this comment was made, we had an depth analysis of who would win in a fight (five quintillion eels or one magma?), I passed out at the booth, and woke up at my house a few hours later.
cloteally	welcome to the club, buddy, welcome to the club.
cloteally	of course everything I'm going to say can be totally false to some because everyone is a little different, but I've found that spending time just swirling my tongue around the head, licking up his shaft, sucking on/massaging his balls, is so important. I know Cosmo will tell you that too, but seriously.   personally, it's much more enjoyable for both parties if a significant amount of time is spent playing with the head and teasing. this way, the one giving head doesn't get extremely exhausted after a while of constant oral penetration, and the receiver feels the most amount of pleasure possible. this being said, make sure you communicate about what feels good and what doesn't. you don't want to spend ten minutes of your time playing with his tip if, to him, it feels like you're tickling him with his tongue.   once you start really going to town on the penetrating part, don't stop. look him in the eye, continue playing with his balls, do what you gotta do- but don't stop if you don't need to. trust me, it's worth it.  in short: don't forget the balls, don't forget the head, and communicate so you can remember to not forget anything else.

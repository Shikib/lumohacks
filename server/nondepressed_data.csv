setosadik	no need for personal info, just to talk and stuff. We have a lot of boys so ladies? | 
LostInTheAyther	 Nothing new but still neat
LostInTheAyther	There's a difference in saying he is good and saying he is the best. Thorin knows Hauntzer is good. He just says he's not the best. We may disagree with Thorin about just how good Hauntzer is, but it doesn't do well to misrepresent his position. 
LostInTheAyther	Holy crap I would love some TSM gym gear
LostInTheAyther	I feel like the creators hand was forced. This is the only in character way for them to say that we aren't supposed to be doing anything but waiting. Petscop is a webseries, not an ARG, and yet this community continues to treat it like the latter. Not ONCE has their been a puzzle for the community to solve to receive more content. It's clearly not the authors MO. Wait for new videos and enjoy the lore. Stop trying to "solve" petscop.  Edit: I should add, webseries taking months and even years to release new content is nothing new. Look at projects like EverymanHYBRID, it has 7 month gaps at times between videos. Stop being so impatient.
LostInTheAyther	I think he's been wanting to step back from playing for a while, but from what I recall he does want to stay with TSM as a coach, especially with 5v5 coming
LostInTheAyther	I admit I was worried it might not make sense so I'm glad I could clarify it for you. It was one of those things that without a doubt made sense in my head but I wasn't 100% sure how to word it so I didn't know if I got it across in the best way haha. Maybe the writer example would have been better :P 
LostInTheAyther	No, the metaphor is that someone is telling you a story that you have to wait to receive, not just any written work. It could work with writer if I'd made the metaphor about books in a series that hasn't been completed, but either way I still wrote it right in the sense I was speaking of it.
LostInTheAyther	Think of it like someone reading you a book, chapter by chapter, and giving you the transcript of each chapter that you've gone through but nothing more. Maybe you can parse out the end of the story early, but you'll never come to the true 100% conclusion. And you have no access to later information without the reader. It makes sense to just let the reader give you the story than trying to go through each paragraph hoping to find a secret hint of the end.  Just because petscop is about a game, doesn't mean it is a game. If it becomes an ARG later then by all means everyone can go crazy and solve shit, but as of right now, we're just listeners to the story, waiting for the reader to bring us the next chapter.  Also fun is subjective, you may think trying to solve something that is unsolvable is fun, but plenty of people think that what's fun may be the atmosphere and story itself. 
LostInTheAyther	Gen 3 has always been my favorite. Had the second best starters, but the most fun mechanics, story, and setting.
LostInTheAyther	Holy shit I'm an idiot. Thanks, bud.  xD
LostInTheAyther	How do I make someone an admin in my clan? There used to be an area in the settings for it but I can't find it now, and even following an old direct link leads me to a dead page. Any help would be appreciated!
LostInTheAyther	Also our old SMITE team, they were pretty negative on the org (granted they weren't treated as well as our players are now).
LostInTheAyther	I hope C9 makes it. They are my second favorite Org (I love their CSGO Team) !
LostInTheAyther	Xmithie and Olleh probably split a ton of points, I think casters and analysts aren't allowed to vote for more than one player per team, to help ward off favoritism of a team from Riot employees.
LostInTheAyther	What I think is really neat about his drawing those kinds of bans, is that they don't always go through. Teams like C9, IMT, and TSM aren't afraid of Huhi's niche picks and it forces CLG to be good without them too. It's kind of like a way that CLG helps cement the top 4 as it's own elite, in a sense, in that the top 4 play and prepare so much better than the others that they don't need their own pocket picks like that and games can simply come down to execution, where as the other 6 teams can't count on their skill and teamwork and execution beating out Huhi's champion pool so they have to eliminate it just to try (and fail as was DIG's case here) to play the meta the top 4 do. I think because of this, CLG even with omargod, can still make it to worlds because in the gauntlet they will have to face another Top 4 team to make it, and they still have that high level of execution that can challenge C9 (obviously this is assuming they beat DIG again or FLY depending on which makes it through)
LostInTheAyther	TSM ACADEMY THE DUDE WHEN 
LostInTheAyther	You know how you don't like it? Well crazy enough, OP does! It's an opinion my dude. Maybe more people agree with your opinion, but that doesn't make OP's wrong or yours right, and vice versa. Just let people enjoy what they want to. It doesn't affect you.
LostInTheAyther	Flame has seen some shit
LostInTheAyther	Petscop isn't an ARG though, at least not at the moment. It's a webseries, the difference being that audiences need to interact with produced content in an ARG and don't have to in a webseries.  Nothing the community has done has had a known impact on the story. 
LostInTheAyther	There is no way to no for sure about any content outside of YouTube because YouTube is the only confirmed source of information we have on the series (As the channel doesn't have any linked accounts in its about or descriptions) and the maker of the videos never addresses the audience (As in us viewers) and instead only seems to address a friend of his (the one who he is showing to prove it's real).
LostInTheAyther	Hell yes following now I'm stoked to see him and the team grow together :)
LostInTheAyther	Haha damn that's pretty funny that he'd do that lol. Nice to see a creator reply like that. I feel like Matt gets this free image of being hella insightful because he covers so many things that garner no response from the authors of the works involved. I wonder what the channel would be like if he was constantly getting told he was wrong
LostInTheAyther	Hey man he's not THAT tall lol
LostInTheAyther	Why did you think it was bad? Not saying you're wrong just curious as to your opinion. I feel personally he makes mega leaps in logic these days so I normally can't take his videos seriously outside of the entertainment aspect.
LostInTheAyther	LOL. I regularly am on YouTube, Twitch, and Reddit. It's just how I pass time. Spend a lot of time listening to video essays and multi hour long game critiques, as well as reading articles to keep up with news, and lots and lots of memes. 
LostInTheAyther	T-Mobile, at least in my unlimited plan, throttles after 32gb used. I regularly use up to 50gb a month so it gets to be a hassle towards the end of the month but I know I'm at an extreme for data usage so I doubt most notice it. 
LostInTheAyther	Lmao the ending of that thing is crazy. I was looking into it just last week when I was binging all of NightMinds old videos.
LostInTheAyther	I'm sure others have said this before, but I am really confused as to how seriously to take this. Why would a web series suddenly become an ARG? It makes no sense to me. We never had to solve anything for the other videos to receive more content so why start now? And the narrator of the videos never interacts with the audience, only ever talking to the friend coming to visit. Not to mention this community is much smaller than the YouTube one like, if this was supposed to be real solved puzzles for the story why go to like 5% of the audience to do it? All of this just feels out of place for the whole story.
LostInTheAyther	He deactivated it for a couple hours to rest from it a bit.
LostInTheAyther	If you have access to an oven, Pork Belly is one of the cheapest cuts of meat from which you can achieve a buttload of flavor if seasoned well,  with  salt, pepper, and paprika being my go to. Roast it for a couple of hours or so and enjoy. You can get like 2.5 lbs of that shit for like 6 dollars where I shop. Pair it with rice and suddenly you've got an actual dinner for like 4 days that cost at most 10 bucks.
LostInTheAyther	Chaox to my knowledge quit coaching over a year ago. His twitch bio actually states that he hasn't been involved with esports in a year as well. 
LostInTheAyther	It's a good day to be a TSM fan :)
LostInTheAyther	Man Zven is so good on Kog. Really fun to watch both teams play. What a fun game. Some macro mistakes from TSM but I think they can clean it up.  GG EU. :)
LostInTheAyther	People probably like the boyfriend as he is a professional Heroes of the Storm player, so if his girlfriend is cheating on him, his fans would be pissed at her and supporting him.
LostInTheAyther	So I read the last line as tied to a dog at first and was kinda grossed out and confused all at once lol
LostInTheAyther	Wait isn't that a CSGO map? :o
LostInTheAyther	Man that's so cool! I never knew. I have always wanted to try Payday but never had anyone to play it with so I couldn't really justify the purchase. :/
LostInTheAyther	TSM still clearly had map pressure considering they were able to get into Elder and clear almost all the Elder vision Dig had and start it. And had Dig not had Bard it could be secured and TSM would be free to either engage a fight or disengage and get back to base through blue side of the jungle to bot lane. 
LostInTheAyther	And yet while losing those objectives TSM was still even in gold. They were bad decisions, but they didn't lose them the game. 
LostInTheAyther	Everyone here is mad about map movements and Sven smites, but really the main problem this game was the Bard. Every time TSM went for an objective it was just ulted by Bard, allowing the Weaver's Wall to fall and letting Dig in. Without Bard in that comp I feel like we would have secured pretty much every objective. Won't be surprised if TSM either bans it or grabs it for Bio.
LostInTheAyther	What he meant by his playstyle being valued is that when Jensen came aboard Meteos and Jensen had clashing ideological stances in game. They wanted to play the game differently and it lead to bad synergies and meteos feeling like his desired playstyle was undervalued.
LostInTheAyther	Man you guys sure are alot nicer in here after our loss now that Turtle is gone 🤔
LostInTheAyther	"New"
LostInTheAyther	Yo but for real tho who the fuck hangs a mouse in a display like that 
LostInTheAyther	 Oh man I would love to know that myself haha.
LostInTheAyther	Thanks! I'll look into it later today along with the other suggestions :)
LostInTheAyther	That's an interesting set up haha. Maybe it would be worth it to invest in a standing mic? 
LostInTheAyther	Hmm I've had problems in the past with 3.5mm cords just wearing out often. I tend to go through a lot of aux cables and standard headphones. Are the cords replaceable on the G933 or the Sennheisers?
LostInTheAyther	Looking for a Headset Recommendation | Hi guys, I am looking for a recommendation for a headset. I've for the past year or two been using the Corsair Void RGB headset. The wireless yellowjacket one. I'm really a fan of its heftiness, sturdiness, and comfort, but it has a ton of connection issues (it's the wireless model), the sound quality is good but not the best, and I'm never using it away from my computer so the wireless aspect isn't really that big of a plus. Instead of just getting the wired Void, I was thinking of trying a Logitech headset, so I was wondering if there is anything that matches the comfort, that has better sound quality. It doesn't have to be wireless, and I'd probably prefer wired, to get past the connection issues.  Thank's in advance! 
LostInTheAyther	Since when was PersistentBlade a part of TSM?
LostInTheAyther	 It was a joke lol but thanks for answering anyway :P
LostInTheAyther	Congrats to G2! Really cool to see them win. Hope they can accomplish something great in the finals! :)
LostInTheAyther	I don't think turtle and Bjerg went
LostInTheAyther	It wasn't a throw. G2 outscaled our comp and we failed to push our advantages when we could. Not everything is a throw. Both teams played their comps right, they just played better while TSM was too afraid to get beat in a fight to ACTUALLY THROW the game.
LostInTheAyther	Sad to see the loss :( Our boys need a break though. The loss here is going to make it tough to face fans, and so many people are going to treat them poorly for this. I hope they pick it up this summer and with Doublelifts help come back stronger. Fans need to remember the team owes us nothing. Them losing isn't an insult to you. Let them recoup and work hard next split to get to worlds.
LostInTheAyther	In this video she is saying she isn't as radical as people make her out to be, and that she has been conversing more and more with antifeminists and antisjw personalities to better round out her ideas and her own positions and learn from the other side. She talks about conversation between opposing sides being important, and to shut people out for simply having opposing ideas is wrong. These views pretty clearly go against the mainstream sjw-type mindset so other feminists/sjw have been calling her out on it saying pretty awful things about her.   I'm happy she is willing to converse though. I used to follow her back when she first started Sex+ but there was a point where it got too far out there for me to agree with and listen to (sounded like propaganda and not an educational thing), so I'm glad she has turned this leaf and is willing to learn and communicate with new voices.
LostInTheAyther	Man SKT is so good. Everything was crazy even for like 10 minutes and then suddenly SKT explode into a 4k gold lead winning all over the map. Really cool to watch them play. Sucks that we lost, but we aren't out of the running yet. We still have a chance to get out of groups so I hope we can work hard and make it :)
LostInTheAyther	My stream name is Bulbasaur so I keep it green to match my type.
LostInTheAyther	Nobody ranked clg high last year and they lost to the wild card and still made it to finals have more faith in our boys, my dude.
LostInTheAyther	Maybe give some new music a chance instead of trashing it for no reason after hearing a 10 second clip?
LostInTheAyther	Happy that we won :) Would love to see GAM make it to the main stage to see how good they are against the other teams. They looked really good!
LostInTheAyther	This thread is guaranteed to get less comments than the other two because people can't call Turtle and Sven shit based off this game. 
LostInTheAyther	Yeah. Making mistakes and playing awful are very different. He made a mistake game one and it let GAM snowball. Game 2 was a team fighting issue, not Sven being shit. But oh well people believe what they want.
LostInTheAyther	It will make a fine addition to your collection!
LostInTheAyther	This is the wrong subreddit for this content. This is an electronic music subreddit.
LostInTheAyther	Mm okay. Thanks man.
LostInTheAyther	I guess I just don't know why China and EU are "Main Event" regions. I could understand with Korea winning MSI and Worlds they'd get a bye, but shouldn't everyone else have to play for that chance? 
LostInTheAyther	Is there anywhere I can read the stage formatting? I don't understand the Stage 1 Stage 2 main event thing, nor do I understand why the region's are where they are (for example why is eu in the main event alongside korea?) Just curious if anyone has more info on this stuff. Thanks in advance.
LostInTheAyther	Hoping for the best. But holding reasonable expectations of not thinking we're going to win outright. It's going to be a tough tournament and honestly I just wanna see how we stack up so the guys know what to improve on.
LostInTheAyther	Only Sith deal in absolutes.
LostInTheAyther	Fun fact: if anyone has (legal) access to a military base in the US, plenty of the Post/Base Exchanges have them still in stock. I got one in March within a week for my birthday from my dad who just ordered it from the local PX for me.
LostInTheAyther	It's at the very end. It's a 3 minute video man. OP could have time stamped it but it's not that hard to look through a 3 minute video. 
LostInTheAyther	My last search was for Carl Sagan so I just hope I don't end up sounding like I worship the guy or am too fanatical. I just think he is really neat.
LostInTheAyther	The final scene in Burial at Sea Episodes 1 and the Lobotomy Scene in episode 2, fucked me up real bad.   I still remember when I finished Episode 1, I was with my buddies who were all on mushrooms at the time (I was their sober babysitter) and I was playing this. As the cutscene played out, I was so distraught, I threw my controller away and almost started crying. I got so mad and felt so disgusted, which only fucked my friends up even more because the sober dude was freaking the fuck out.  And the Lobotomy Scene is just so disgusting to sit through. 
LostInTheAyther	As much as I find her attractive at both sizes, that's a pretty unhealthy amount of gained weight.
LostInTheAyther	Am I the only one upset that Ezreal's Pulsfire skin, the very first Ultimate Skin ever made, is both likely going to look worse than this Caitlyn skin, while also not being a unique skin theme? I feel a skin with the rank and effort of an "Ultimate" Skin should be Unique to that character, and should never share it's theme with anyone else. I dunno I just think it's wrong to have multiple Ultimate-themed skins like this, especially at Non-Ultimate levels. It takes the uniqueness of the skin away.
LostInTheAyther	I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion, but how often are people really starting new conversations in champ select that this becomes an issue? Surely if its a conversation worth having it can either wait til the game starts and you just whisper each other in game, or you wait til after? It can be annoying sometimes I guess, but I see no way as to how this could be an even remotely "crucial" functionality. 
LostInTheAyther	Man, seeing this again, and thinking of Legends as a whole, just makes me so happy that we have Max. Other orgs have teams of people working on stuff like this, and they still pale in comparison to him. He is so good at what he does.
LostInTheAyther	His success is more likely attributes to the fact that he plays with Dyrus, Summit, and JoshOG more lately and they all have establish a large crossover fan base. People probably jump to watch him in hopes to see his hijinks with the other 3. Not everything is some crazy conspiracy.
LostInTheAyther	It wasn't a mistake. They wanted to leave and failed to hold up contractual obligations, and the org wanted an NA team to market at home and integrate them more with the brand. Does it suck that those players are doing so well under a different brand? Sure, but it's not like we were missing some major business opportunity. It has been mentioned many times before by even regi himself that it was a mutually desired split.
LostInTheAyther	What happened to Helios?  And kfo?
LostInTheAyther	Wait is this an ultimate skin?
LostInTheAyther	I mean if you don't listen to that kind of music it doesn't matter how old you are you won't know the classics.
LostInTheAyther	Just really messy team fights in game 3, which is really shocking. TSM lacking coordination in team fights is almost unheard of domestically. Hoping we pull it back together tomorrow.
LostInTheAyther	Kinda hard for WT to do well when TL is literally 3 or 4 manning bot all game.
LostInTheAyther	Always upvote papa
LostInTheAyther	I feel like saying this defeats the whole impact of the game.
LostInTheAyther	Saving for a friend ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
LostInTheAyther	Hey, I thought I would let you know that currently the beard alone sells for 15 and the helmet alone sells for 30, were someone to purchase those together it would be 45 whereas your combination price is set at 50. I don't know if etsy automatically chooses the combined item if someone selects the two, but I figured you might want to know so someone doesn't buy both and pay less for it if you value it at 50.
LostInTheAyther	It also sucks that when people think gamers like EDM they assume it's all the poppy shit or trap. Like yeah I like EDM  but people aren't gonna be getting revved up for some trance and nu disco.
LostInTheAyther	I love how Kevin can't hold back his smile even when trying to look thug haha
LostInTheAyther	I think he is having similar troubles to sven, I don't think either is really comfortable this split with the meta junglers. Kinda sad because I always liked how much of a rock Xmithie was for clg the past couple splits. Hope he can pick it up again soon.
LostInTheAyther	Didn't you hear? Spartans never die. 
LostInTheAyther	I really fuckin dig the name my dude. Kurt was something else.
LostInTheAyther	I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't true. Both sides of the aisle employ smear campaigns, and while if this is true, this is insanely awful, if it's not, it just spreads a false belief that all conservative Canadian students at this college want to harm or kill Muslims, which reduces the chance at anyone having a conversation and just painting one another as the enemy.
LostInTheAyther	For anyone curious she is a chaturbate camgirl, TideCallerNami
LostInTheAyther	It's a time like this where the comment my buddies and I made after watching Zootopia truly applies: "I'm not saying I'm into animals, but I wanna fuck that bunny."
LostInTheAyther	Not to necessarily defend anyone's specific beliefs, but using the term "cockroaches from r/altright" is hardly unbiased. 
LostInTheAyther	Haha in the side bar it says last subscriber was Leffen. Too funny. 
LostInTheAyther	Ooooohhh thanks man. I only saw that movie once so it slipped passed me haha

ZPM89	You wake up in the morning as your favourite superhero. What's the first thing you do? | 
ZPM89	What video game world would you go and live in if you were given a one way ticket to go there? | 
ZPM89	What's the funniest/weirdest thing you've ever overheard? |

ZPM89	What is/was the cheapest thing you've ever purchased that is one of your most important/favourite possession ever? | 
ZPM89	Being able to play bumper cars in the sky and getting a shit tonne of money. 
ZPM89	Depends what you mean. If it's about the fighting and all the action, then Saving Private Ryan or, I know it's not a film, but Band of Brothers.   But I also think The Pianist is a damn good WW2 film telling the story of ordinary folk who lived during the war. 
ZPM89	The snake continues to slither around the naked lady and they play. 
ZPM89	So you're now putting words in my mouth? Typical 
ZPM89	Definitely isn't a prank. How the fuck am I gonna candidly film this?
ZPM89	Haha I've just been pissing around the whole time. You need to lighten up buddy
ZPM89	Face it. You insulted someone you don't even know. Yeah do it from behind your screen...
ZPM89	Deflecting? You went on to insult me by insinuating I'm a loser who stays inside and watches Star Wars. I was merely defending myself. Something you haven't been able to do here. 
ZPM89	I've watched them all...I get paid 5k a month and get laid on average 7 days a week. I have a good life my friend. 
ZPM89	I could still get arrested for robbing a bank even though if I was just the driver of the getaway vehicle. I never actually robbed the bank but I'm taking part. Same thing. You could head out in your car with your friends, your friends go and purge, you drive away. You're taking part
ZPM89	No. Saying none confirms that you will not kill anybody. You never stated that you would or would not take part. Whether or not you kill anyone. You can still take part. 
ZPM89	Just loserish attitude my bro
ZPM89	You might go out with your friends but not actually kill anyone. Therefore you're still participating. Are you that dumb?
ZPM89	Just is bro. Face it
ZPM89	You did not say the words "I will not take part" so you're wrong 
ZPM89	Blame my phone
ZPM89	Loser
ZPM89	Ok so you could of just ignored this post or commented you wouldn't take part in the purge 
ZPM89	...what
ZPM89	But it would be legal...ffs just play the game man
ZPM89	Not a jar of them? 
ZPM89	What's your most memorable video gaming moment? | 
ZPM89	I'm a country boy so would prefer to stay in the country. But, I do like the odd city break now and again. I have a few. Paris, Munich, Rome, Buenos Aires, San Francisco or LA (only Beverly Hills though)
ZPM89	Damn that's naughty 
ZPM89	There's no game by that title. Your being bad...
ZPM89	You can play as any video game character in another video game world, what is your combination? | 
ZPM89	My asshole
ZPM89	I wasn't implying for there to be one, I asked a question. And believe it or not, in some countries it is a crime. 
ZPM89	Here's the point . <------ and here's an addict ------>  Two can play that game
ZPM89	Yeah I knew it was gonna be there didn't I...
ZPM89	"I don't like it so it's terrible". That's generally the idea if you don't like something. Lol
ZPM89	If you read properly, I didn't ask for there to be a law, I was asking if there was one. 
ZPM89	How the fuck is it a joke!? I will not lighten up. I have a partner who has attempted suicide in the past and suffers depression. So I will not fucking lighten up. 
ZPM89	What would happen if the last 2 video games you played merged together? How bad is it for you? | 
ZPM89	Yeah me too so I then thought of asking Reddit lol
ZPM89	What video game character would you ask to go for a drink with? Why? | 
ZPM89	We began speaking on Couchsurfing and were speaking for nearly a whole year before actually meeting. (I'm from the UK, she's from Argentina)  A year later she went on her planned trip to Europe and when she visited London, we arranged to meet. We spent the day walking around and talking, we even spent the night in the same room at a hotel she booked for us. (Nothing happened! As I'm a good boy)  The next day we travelled to Wales to meet a friend of mine for a few days. We had a good time there and then we returned to London. I went onwards back home.   After 2 days on her penultimate day in London, before leaving the country, we arranged another day in London. So off I went. This was when we began to realise we like each other. So I asked her (before leaving to go home again) "Would you be my long distance girlfriend?" *a bit cringy I know*. She said yes. She continued to her final destination before heading back down to Argentina.   We obviously continued to speak and Skype etc.   I then booked a flight to go visit her and stay with her in Buenos Aires for a month. During that month, she showed me around, we went out and had fun. After the month was up, we were enjoying ourselves so much, I extended the stay for another month. Eventually I went back home as it was Christmas.   I then went back in the January for another 2 months and after that time was up, we both moved back to the UK where we now live.   It has been 4 years. 
ZPM89	Luigi!?
ZPM89	Easy!
ZPM89	What video game can you describe so badly that others have to guess at it is? | 
ZPM89	You're a radio DJ and your career has come to an end, what is the last song you play? | 
ZPM89	What do you do if the character from the last video game you played as is now hunting you down? | 
ZPM89	But what about Rome? There are ruins within the city. Rome still prospers and has never died. 
ZPM89	Hopefully it will be a spell checker

ZPM89	Swear a girls name I heard was "Alopecia, get back over here!"
ZPM89	Was on vacation/holiday in Tunisia and this camel got away from its owner and just went stir crazy and ran at people. I was one of them. 
ZPM89	Childhood 
ZPM89	Nearly trampled by a horse once. And a camel.   Our plane almost crashed on landing once too. That was the worst. 
ZPM89	Someone who works with my mother used to be in the navy many years ago. He was stationed somewhere on a ship when the gulf war broke out and he was sent there and they did whatever they did.   Every single person on that ship were awarded bravery medals for what they did.   This guy served drinks the entire time.   
ZPM89	Learn from it man!
ZPM89	What's your morning/daily routine you can't live without? | 
ZPM89	Did you answer my question?
ZPM89	What was the explanation after all?
ZPM89	What's the strangest thing that's happened to you when alone? | 
ZPM89	Come to think of it, maybe sonic, or balloon fight. Fucking nostalgia right now! Or the shooting game where the controller was the gun and you shoot the ducks and that dog goes and collects them. Duck Shoot? 
ZPM89	What movie quote/scene would you pause and end with the "thug life" music? | 
ZPM89	I think my first ever video game I played was either Mario or Goldeneye on the N64. Mario was on the NES or SNES. 
ZPM89	Who's buying the new Call Of Duty then? | [removed]
ZPM89	A Carentan map would be brilliant. Have you seen Band of Brothers? The Carentan episode? A map like that when they attack Carentan would be epic. 
ZPM89	How did the 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' become the universal meaning for good/bad? | 
ZPM89	Apparently it's not
ZPM89	Drug takers of Reddit, what was the last time you 'tripped out' like? | 
ZPM89	What would be a commandment to add to the list of the 10 commandments if you were chosen to do so? | 
ZPM89	What does crusty cum look like? She immediately knew what it was?
ZPM89	Had a night out with my friends that was like The Hangover.  Was proper weird. We were all meant to stay at mine, my friends had all parked at mine. Went out and drank. Next morning I woke up in my bed at home and found myself alone.   Tried ringing my friends to no luck at first. After a while, they began getting in contact with me. It turns out they were all at different parts of the county (England).   Between all of the destinations we were all at, it was like 100 miles lol. One friend stole a bicycle and rode back to his house along the motorway all night (15ish miles). Another was about 50 miles away. Had gotten a taxi.   They both had to return to my house by train to collect their stuff and cars haha. We still don't know wtf we did m, but it turned out to be a very expensive night.

ZPM89	Mama took those batteries, she took them awayyyy, MAMA TOOK THOSE BATTERIES!!!
ZPM89	In half?
ZPM89	A good one 
ZPM89	Plain and simple. I like it
ZPM89	Haha
ZPM89	That's what I thought 
ZPM89	But do we learn that from a young age or is it just in us?
ZPM89	I'm with you here. I do most things alone.   I spend days out in London alone. Just walk about. Travel to and from London alone.   Where I live we have a nice forest and I go up there 3/4 times a week, just walk around the foliage, find a nice quiet spot amongst the trees, lean up against one and smoke a cigar. I even take a packed lunch with me sometimes and just eat and smoke and listen to the forest sounds. 
ZPM89	I'll let you know once I've bounced back. Still in the lowest point. 
ZPM89	What's a recurring nightmare/dream you once had/still have? Why do you think you had these? | 
ZPM89	I use sky scanner. 
ZPM89	As a passenger. For me it's the 787. Flew on one few months back from Buenos Aires to Madrid. Wow what a plane. 
ZPM89	Don't ask such a stupid question. I'm 27 and my bro is 25 and we still fart in eachothers faces when giving the opportunity!
ZPM89	I play video games. Obviously everyone who plays video games will not say that it is pathetic and sad. Everyone else though kinda does don't they?  I could play my Xbox One 24/7. I do have goals in life and know the path I wanna go down, but I just enjoy playing it so much. Genuinely think I'm addicted.   With Cities: Skylines just come out. I'm gonna buy it and those sort of games I can fucking stay on all day and night.   GTA5 i can just fuck about for hours on end, BF1, Ryse and PES can be on for ages too. 
ZPM89	Every week. Every 2 weeks at most. 
ZPM89	I'm a bit of a photographer and when on holiday last year in Lanzarote (Canary Islands) I came across a photography shop so ventured inside.   I saw this filter that I liked which was going at something like 150/160 euros. The guy asked to have my camera and proceeded to demonstrate the filter which was pretty neat.   I genuinely didn't have a lot of cash on me (like 20 euros) and no cards. So that's what I told him and even showed him.   He accepted the 20 euros and away I went with a damn good filter to add to my equipment lol
ZPM89	What would be the worst death imaginable? | 
ZPM89	I'd still be fucking unemployed!
ZPM89	Sorry,  meant a Roman Legionnaire. Just one. 
ZPM89	Elaborate please?
ZPM89	I'm 27 and my friends are still the ones I made during high/secondary school. 
ZPM89	Yes...my friends...
ZPM89	What was your nickname at school and still is to your friends? Why? | 
ZPM89	Christ I'm dumb. I'll blame tiredness 
ZPM89	Why not just wait for the next one?
ZPM89	Although that would be a great sight, I'd want to watch the sinking unfold and the actual iceberg hit. 
ZPM89	I live in the countryside and am into photography, so pretty much everyday I head on out and walk for a couple of hours and take pictures. Smoke a cigar too off the beaten track in the forest amongst the flowers, leaning up against a tree. Just me, by myself with the soundtrack of forest critters and other various sounds while the world goes by.   I love it. Unfortunately though, it doesn't give me money.

KenkaSmug	Online journalism is important. But treating your readers like they are intelligent people is just as vital. Having real articles, links that actually say what the story is about, and allow users to read the entire article without having to click through 11 pages is responsible design. Don't let your marketers tell you how to post your articles, let your web designers tell you how the web actually works. If you want visitors to actually return, focus on user experience, not how many clicks you can get.
Aw982y	You know they can see all the MAC addresses that are attached. Unless they are completely stupid it's not fooling anyone.
Aw982y	Parents of Reddit, what advice would you give to someone who is about to become one?[serious] | 
Aw982y	They are the bright yellow plates. They were designed to kinda shame ppl with DUI convictions.
Aw982y	I would have said that was a volcano 
Aw982y	I think you hit the wrong reply button
Aw982y	Was expecting something about a sister.
Aw982y	Why should it be banned? If someone goes out and murders someone I think they should get the same fate as the person they killed. I don't understand why we keep ppl in our prison with life sentences. Why should we taxpayers pay for them to rot in prison? They should just be put to death. Especially when there is absolutely no doubt they were the ones that committed the crime.

Aw982y	Tire carrier wouldn't open. Took it apart to find this. | 
Aw982y	Only about year
Aw982y	Don't care too much for the tail lights 
Aw982y	Yeah last time I went we ended up on some dirt bike trails because we got turned around. The maps they give you of the place suck. They need to either invest in actually marking trails or some type of gps but of course the gps isn't very realistic.
Aw982y	Also maybe if it wasn't that ugly bright orange
Aw982y	Other than the obvious how was it? Haven't been in almost a year. Been wanting to get back out there but my closest jeep friends are 4 hours away. 
Aw982y	I'm out in bastrop 
Aw982y	You aren't able to stop walking for 2 seconds?
Aw982y	Because walking around with no pants is "frowned upon" in our society
Aw982y	The car being there or that he can't stop walking to take a picture?
Aw982y	Already have sonic. So either of the other two. Got hurt a couple months ago and haven't been able to work. Rarely even able to get out of bed. Been kinda depressed the last couple weeks just because I can't do anything. Going to see a surgeon in a couple days to make an appointment to have surgery. More than likely will be out for another couple of months. I've been wanting to buy a new game but not being able to work means money is super tight. Also have a baby on the way so any extra money has to go into savings to prepare for the baby.
Aw982y	They're legal but can't stick out past a certain distance. I think like 12"?

Aw982y	I prefer the steel wheels. If you do much rock crawling the alloy wheels can get bent if you catch a rock. Alloys are fine for mud and a little better for fuel economy. 
Aw982y	Most of them don't care if you take pictures of them. They don't like the assholes that want to get in their faces and in the way of what they are trying to do
Aw982y	My comment was more on the fact that they are quoting Wikipedia. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone. Not saying that they were wrong.

Aw982y	Isn't $2 at the dollar store still paying full price? It's the full price the dollar store is asking...
Aw982y	Why is that? Just curious.
Aw982y	I paid the $5 for it on my phone to see if it would be worth the $30 for the switch. After playing it on my phone I've realized the $5 was a waste of money. If the game was free it would just be a waste of memory space. Just my opinion though.
Aw982y	There's that splice module in there that sucks though. Whenever I see one I cut my pairs out of it. They can cause all sorts of dsl issues. Also around here we have serious ant problems and they build their mound inside the less and the modules just disintegrate 
Aw982y	I've seen those or at least similar ones on eBay

Aw982y	Some of them carry meatballs full of nails
Aw982y	Yes. I'm deaf in one ear
Aw982y	Or by .5
Aw982y	Actually it isn't. You can lift the armrest up. It then fills the gap between seats making two seats one. Also if it were flipped over the other direction the cup holder would be useless
Aw982y	Some ppl have 3 nipples. Does that count?
Aw982y	Me and my wife actually have separate tubes of toothpaste. No one in my family has ever shared toothpaste.
Aw982y	Anything that makes a lot noise. Bonus if it can't be turned off.
Aw982y	That faucet has been in that location longer than the steps have. 
Aw982y	You can do that but some restaurants still refuse to serve you because they don't want to be responsible. 
Aw982y	Is it not better to block a sidewalk than block cars from trying to get through? If the front end of your vehicle is sticking way out and someone is crossing the drive area and a car is driving along they won't see the kid walking out as quickly and are a lot more likely to end up with someone getting seriously injured or even killed. 
Aw982y	So you are saying that the truck makes it impossible to use the sidewalk now?
Aw982y	There is this place called a park that you could take them to.
Aw982y	That's either a Ford F-250 or 350. Those are long trucks. You should try parking one sometime. Guarantee you couldn't even get it in between the lines. It's either stick out on the back or stick out into traffic. Sticking out into traffic is much more dangerous. Besides there's plenty of room to walk behind it. 
Aw982y	A neutered horse?
Aw982y	The first topic is DID- Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's a disorder. An eating disorder is a mental illness. What would make this any different?
Aw982y	What does att have to do with google fiber?
Aw982y	Looks like plenty of room to get into it
Aw982y	I work for a telco. There really isn't much voltage going through the lines. A normal phone line is 49V. If it's ringing it's usually double so around 98V. Most telco stuff is going to fiber optics now. The signal we are primarily using now won't shock you at all. Not many ppl have phone lines generated from a central office these days. Even business are going to all digital phones.
Aw982y	If I woke up one morning and most of our mesquites were gone I'd be ecstatic!
Aw982y	That's all we've got on my ranch in central Texas. It sucks. It's a really hard wood. I bought a new chain for my chainsaw and after only 4 hours the blade was so dull it wouldn't cut anything. Whenever family or friends talk about wanting some for BBQ I tell them to come get whatever they want.
Aw982y	Working on a ranch. My grandmother owns one and I've always wished it made enough money so that I could quit my job and run it full time instead of it being something to do in the evenings.

sneakersneakersneak	I honestly believe our "soul"/"consciousness"/"self" continues to exist, but is no longer bound to our physical body and thus subject to the laws of space and time. I think we sort of absorb back into the universe and become a kind of intangible energy that has a conscious awareness but can move freely through space and time, and does not have to rely on sense to interact with the universe.  At least that's what I hope happens!

sneakersneakersneak	I have a very similar story - bought the 60 day program about 3 years ago and tried several times to do it everyday but always ended up quiting like 6, 10, 14 days in because I just couldn't keep up with the every day. Then i changed my mindset to "let's just do every workout, doesn't matter if I take days off when I need them. Just get through the first month". Last week finally finished the first month (took me about 45 days) and can say that the first 7-10 workout days are BY FAR the hardest but once you get the hang of the movements and start building muscle, they become a lot less intimidating.   You can do it!!

She liked miniature things. Yeah my dick is somewhat miniature. Anyway sometimes she would grab the spoon from her miniature kitchen hold it between her thumb and index finger tips. And then she would eat the precum with that spoon from the tip of my dick. but she dumped me. I believe she found a guy with a smaller dick. Yeah That's my story.
popsicletesticle	No. You are slaves of money lenders (FED)  and they are not interested in hiding this fact from you as much as they did while you had a chance to get rid of them.
popsicletesticle	Probably yes. Impossible to know because it's denial.    Just imagine what life would be like if every human on the planet went infertile. It would be heaven.

popsicletesticle	No I asked would you burn them to death and it didn't involve Nazi party memebers either.  Some cocnerned German people came and criticised my question because of some historical facts totally irrelevant to my question.  Just seeing how frustrated they become whenever the Holocaust mentioned is enough annoying for me to bring this subject up at every chance. They look like they just want people to forget what they did which makes me think they haven't changed that much.
popsicletesticle	No. Making children is a stupid idea. People should  stop breeding.
popsicletesticle	I don't have an answer to this question. So no I don't want to burn or kill anyone thats why I'm asking people's opinion.

popsicletesticle	Armenians cooperated with British army against ottoman empire during WW1 they raided and burnt villages killed and raped the wives and the children of men fighting the world war 1 far away from their homes. Ottomans loaded Armenians on trains and exiled them to stop this happening. Many died on their way because of hunger and diseases. Ottoman empire couldn't find enough food for its soldiers. Many had to eat their horses and eat grasshoppers. They didn't have enough equipment most of them were barefeet. I mean in this state of poverty the government couldn't do any better and give Armenians food and medicine.   This nothing like putting people in gas chambers or lining them in front of a wall and firing a million bullets. You may disagree that exiling a certain group is not an act of genocide but one thing is certain Armenians are not mass murdered like Jews or Bosniaks or rwandans.
popsicletesticle	Pussy and tits.

popsicletesticle	Oh I didn't know that. Who else gassed the jews? Because France and Britain was fighting against Germans. I mean why fight your enemy's enemy right?   And still this doesn't answer why did Germans kill the Jews.
popsicletesticle	Yeah we all know that obviously but among all the other nationalist movements around the world it is Germans who killed the Jews.  So adressing those who killed Jews as  nazis is not specific enough to adress the people who killed the Jews. Its Germans. Not Italian nationalists. Not French or British nationalists. But Germans. That's what I am asking actually. If killing Jews is about nationalism why did that not happen in other places full of nationalist people.   Question is very clear why did "Germans" kill Jews? 
popsicletesticle	You say Nazis are Nazis Germans are Germans as if Nazis are not Germans. What's with all the rhetorics?  Nazis are Germans aren't they?  This does not necessarily mean Germans are nazis but   Nazis are indeed Germans.
popsicletesticle	I think all books and movies are biased. You need to pick one from each side to understand what happened really.

They are the kind of people who make easy money by tax fraud extreme nepotism and all sorts of illegal business. See where I live in Turkey there seems to exist law enforcement and legal order but in reality the country is run by corruption and law of the jungle all over. No business owner pay taxes properly and they.. I don't know how to describe these people. They will do EVERYTHING for money. They are violent people. There is terrorism all over the state and Kurdish tribes still exist today although they migrated to big cities. They are giant families of 40.000 100.000 people they have ak47s hidden in some shithole ghetto house ready to use if necessary. They stick together violate laws to making their way of getting rich by using that power. This happened with an exponentially increasing speed. No matter how fancy and nice they try to look outside these people are actually the savages lived in the mountains 30 years ago. Most of them are the only 2nd generation in big cities and they became ten times wealthier by doing corrupted business in 10 years than the civilized people with proper education who have been living in cities for decades. Almost all Kurds are like this. And most Turks have no problem with that. Turks and Kurds living together in a society of Turds.   I was having my second tea and the 3 year old bastard with them wanted to put his feet in the ornamental pool. Then his father grabbed him and carried him back over the tables dripping water drops from the kid's feet one fell in my tea. There is no point telling these people what they do no matter how politely you speak they will yell at you aggressively.   At that point I did not want to pull out a gun and shoot the kid in the head and shoot the man in the balls to stop him from breeding.  I just thought I don't want to live with these inconsiderate uneducated orcs. I wished with all my heart to go somewhere away from this uncivilized fraud dipshits. I really deeply admire how respectful people towards each other in countries like sweden. And believe me genuine  Turkish culture was like that once. No matter what they told you about the Turks we are nothing like that and honestly us who keep that culture and didnt lose our roots are a very small minority in the population of Turkey maybe 25 percent maybe less.

Rosefist	What would your heaven look like? | 
Rosefist	I respect the dedication to your craft sir.
Rosefist	There arn't enough upvotes. 
Rosefist	Theres a british sci-fi called red dward (you can get the audio version for it on audible) and in the second book all three characters get trapped inside "better than life" which does precisely what you've just described.  Except (and i won't spoil the ending in case you look it up) what if you hate yourself?
Rosefist	Here's a little closer to heaven 
Rosefist	Why white boards? 
Rosefist	I'm surprised i'm the first.  https://youtu.be/35f_sNKB_mc?t=18s (not long)  "never be cruel, never be cowardly, and if you are always make amends"
Rosefist	I quite like that idea, i'm an athiest and don't belive in heaven but i like the buffy idea  "there was no pain, no fear or doubt"
Rosefist	Yeah, i'm an atheist too.
Rosefist	Sounds like a holodeck 
Rosefist	So... doctor doom?
Rosefist	Not supposed to be theological more, your paradise etc
Rosefist	3 years ago I started dating about a year after coming out of a long-term relationship (8 years), a little background that might be relevant: i'm a big, guy, I don't think i count as huge but yeah, i have a a bit of squint (i usually have to point it out to poeple they don't noticed unless i do)  I got myself on on eharmony, and was talking to a girl called lets say Karen (not her name). and i really like her, she loves bad movies doctor who and she seems nice and easy to talk to,   After a night of talking, i think "oh hey here's this button that puts her on my preferred contract list"... cept i miss and hit the block button, i contract ehamony to undo it.. and it takes days, and I apologize and explained what happened and she's all like. "that's allright" in a slightly freaked out wasn't that into me kinda way so i just chalk it up to experience and let to rest a bit.  1 month later i maybe says "hey it would be nice to meet sometime" no reply until about a week, where she suggests meeting up at doctor who club.   So i go and turn up take a seat and there are about 30 poeple there and i'm not sat near Her, but i strike up some conversations with poeple near me and eventually try to move round to speak to her.  Cept she's moving away from me and at first i think "ahh this is one of those i'm moving to speak to her and she keeps seeing people who knows situations... and then i work out after the 3rd time it's more one of those comic misunderstandings more one of those frightned maiden runningaway from the monster situations.  So yeah i've had a women literally run away from me during a date pure based on my appearence (presumably) I share an experince with frakenstien's monster
Rosefist	I was never really keen on the whole half-human, they tried to correct it in the comic where he says "ahh yes well i did it to confuse the master" which to me made even less sense  The thing I really like about the doctor's ethics is it develops: when you see the first doctor he acts like a typical time lord in a lot of respects, condescending and arrogant but his exposure to Ian and Barbara seems to change him, and i suppose i think when you say "ah yes well he's half human that's why he's different" it kinda makes him seem a little flatter, a little more 2 dimensional.  
Rosefist	I tell my wife stories, nonsensical usually involving animals never planned.  Do it right before bed most nights, sends her to sleep quick
Rosefist	Speaking as a BioShock fan: still not worth the price
Rosefist	similar to me... yeah it's good when it's done in my case it brought me closer to my mom's side of the family. 
Rosefist	I changed my surname, when i got married, didn't want to take the fuckers name with me.
Rosefist	[socialist asking socialists] Do you believe you can let the beast in and expect it to play nice? | So This might not be the intention of the thread.  If so i apologize   **Background**   I would define myself as a socialist but my only far left sounding board in my area is a communist, and I've been having doubts about whether socialism **not** so much is **possible** (it's happened all over the place, it's definitely possible) but whether once it's achieved within a state can it **last**, I'm thinking specifically of Venezuela where the ruling class backed by the U.S staged a coup against chavez, and as i understand it eventually won.  Infact to the best of my knowledge socialist states don't seem to last very long, where as most communist states do.  And I think the difference is, communism tends to involve a lot more economic control, so the ruling class just don't exist within the state where as under socialism your kinda just limiting them.   **Question**    once a state has become full socialist, how do you stop the ruling class launching successful counter revolutions? how do you *keep* socialism. 
Rosefist	Thanks for your response.  I suppose i would imahine that a revolutionary parliament would work 'for a while' until years passed individuals gathered money, and started lobbying, bribing and slowly turning the state from socialist, to democratic socialist to social democrat to .. well the present day again.
Rosefist	Could you elaborate?
Rosefist	Strawberry mead Foaming concern. | Hey all first one on thread semi long term brewer.  [img]http://i.imgur.com/inIne4s.jpg[/img]  *Background*   I'm making two new batches of mead, the one on the right is a chai mead which i have no concerns about (other than whether it will taste nice)  the one on the left is a strawberry melonel.  *Question*   So i read on stormthecastles site that they foam... like a lot, and it's been only 24 hours since a pitched the yeast (also had a week with a Camden tablet in it) and it's already starting to bubble and foam.  **so** how do i deal with the foam, and when is it safe to wrack without harming the brew ? 
Rosefist	Looks tasty
Rosefist	noted.
Rosefist	Yeah this is my first heavy fruit project, earlier projects have included an orange slice or two and there's been little to no foaming.  I'd read from stormthecastle that you wanna leave about 1/2 to a 1/3 for strawberry mixes, but i swear i read somewhere if you boil the fruits you get less foam (i'd even heard stories of people claiming to get no foam from strawberries).  So yeah lesson learned.
Rosefist	Fair enough.  I think i'm going to settle for regular sittring until it looks safe.  If it's still like this by the end of the night i might pour some out, i can't really be on 24 hour mead watch.
Rosefist	It didn't.
Rosefist	Okay so i stirred it and after a good stir it bubbled very fast (one bubble per second) i'm sure some of that's down to mixuping up the yeast, but you mighta just saved me an explosion. http://i.imgur.com/Ju67NwU.jpg
Rosefist	... and it's in a towel cabinet that would be a real headache if it explodes... okay off to sanitize a spoon.
Rosefist	So stirring it with a sanitized wooden spoon will work... thanks, i guess I'll try that and keep and eye on it.  I really didn't want to be wracking it so early.  
Rosefist	Tuesday if your British :-(
Rosefist	The most obvious would be skyrim, less of an emphasis of violence more RPGy but if you liked the witcher you should be used to that.
Rosefist	Recommend me a like GTA series but... | Same emphasis on open world, driving and shooting [in that order of prefference] and maybe mini games.   Likes: a degree of comedy, exploration.  Dislikes: Grotesque violence [i turned off the console during the torture scene in GTA 5,  to be clear i'm okay wit most actions films but not... you know saw movies] crude comedy [i wanted to like saints row 2 a lot of it i think they had the right idea on most of it, but the comedy is a little crude, and again torture porn]  Games i liked like GTA:  Red dead, but got boring after a while,  GTA 2 was perfect is they made it in 3d i would jump on it, zany comedy w/o being crude] Mafia 2 was pretty good i wish it wasn't based around chapters and stuff ad acctually let you explore the 40s-50s series, but i still liked it.  San Andreas i liked.
Rosefist	My god, what a good idea.
Rosefist	Did you know him was he on this form? either it's not good to lose.  I have a freind in the CP i talk to every so often and certainly was very comforting to have when my liberals friends where zealously defending the EU... and then later clinton.  I'll check out slap stick i heard one vunnergut audio book (the one about space? where all the soul of the dead are still alive in space and every thing to do end up doing to cover it up) and i liked it.  I read mark steel and i'm a morning star reader shareholder (as i'm sure most uk socialists are).  planning on being more active on here generally sometimes i need a break from liberals.  
Rosefist	Yeah see I've tried argueing with right wing aquitinces before, ended up with me being called comrade is a slightly different way to the way you guys might.  Nahh it does help i was more just down at the time, i suppose what i'm taking for this is: take the little victories, in my countrywe shot down TTIP and left the EU... which is good! i suspect it was because of racists but it was none the less good.    
Rosefist	How do you not be sad? | We're in a world now where the popular media really has a tight lid on things, i feel kinda like if I where to say "I'm a socialist" i may as well be saying "i am a lunatic".  People seem to buy the mass media narrative and even when canditates who are socialist or near socialist get through despite the odds they seem to fall victim to establishment forces.    I'm not American I'm british, if i where American i would've supported Bernie, failing that stein but the first got shot down and second has no chance really, in my own country i support corbyn who i suspect is democractic socalist but still pretty good, but the media has declared all out war on him.  So i ask you this, how the hell do you not be miserable and be a socialist, how do you see us as ever having a chance?
Rosefist	A lot of the things  I'm proud of came out of world war2 , people I thinks saw what a state could do if it really wanted and created a national health and a welfare state.  I'm not all that sure how beat to use my abilities to further socialism, I'm not terrible peraausive and there dosent seem to be any socialists or near socialists in my area, I've even had a friend in the CP pull his web for me -and they say theres no unity in the left- to no avail.
Rosefist	I'm tech person my self I think we're a long way off robots take our job -a irreverant definition for A.I is almost invented- there stuff about neural networks that looks potentially promising bit only promising. Technology could benefit us if used rightly though, that'll be the trick.  I see a lot of opposition in the UK, but its rather diaorganzrd from lazy compromising liberals to people to people who appear to be going more right wing, a hair of the dog solution if ever I heard one 0-0.
Rosefist	I don't think i have depression but I qk prone to low mood bow and then, but once I was training to be and o.t and that's good advice! -now network engineer-  And it is a good fight, not many socialists I can find in my area mostly I'm a geek and I see more and more people who roll 20 sided dice falling for populism rhetoric.  " the world is screwed because of an elite group which uses it's power to accumulate wealth for wealth" "yeah yeah whatever commie" "the world is screwed coz.. IMMAGRUNTS" "ZOMG your right"    
Rosefist	Oh indeed think of Luxembourg saying "really? You think you have it tough"
Rosefist	In case anyone is curious this is how it turned out.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=13IIiuzi1tELdV0obJyeGS212WVODcgmwTy-BAB11Y2M
Rosefist	pedant note Dracula happily walks into the sun in Bram stokers Dracula, he's not in pained but he is described as weakned, infact with all the other weaknesses your are basically playing a vampire under storker rules.  I liked the "you dreamt of me" again that's very dracula, I might have to steal that for my own  I like the ghoul mechanic which again i might have to steal but personally if where GMing this character I'd ask my player to make that a cost of at least 1: i entirely see your argument it's nicer than a take out, but without limitations you could have an army of suicidially loyal girlfreinds, at the very least i'd put in "once per session" or "scene"
Rosefist	That's some good solid simple wording there, i'd probably add "as long as there's room to do so -i want to be nice to my poor gm and let him not have me move into the bosses hideout assassinate her in her bed and bugger off
Rosefist	See i completely disagree with how you'd handle Thralls, but that might be my VTM experince talking.  It might be alright for this player, but as a rule i'd put a price on that ability or some kind of limitation think how a player gone rougue could use it.  "Mr Malon has invited you to his club", "i find a women with a similar shape to mne give her my clothes and a hat" have her sit down at the table and blow herself up"  "your meeting the mayo- I enthrall him"  "you have successfully taken down his expert SAS marine liutenant so now all you have to do is- I enthrall him"  debate it's even better than the addictive saliva stunt from DRPG because that just makes people addicts, thralls love their master and most people do just about anything for love. 
Rosefist	I always like looking at characters, particually with custom stunts.  i did some googling inittally and i found some terrible attempts to faterize VTM, which i approve of but they where asscoiate blood points with FP 0_0
Rosefist	Custom stunt, balancing opinions, Vampires | My friend has created a custom fate fantasy setting which is really cool which we all genned together and i wanted to create a stunt largely for vampiric flavour for my vamprtic character but i wanted to check for balancing issues before i presented it for approval from my GM.  My character is a vampire and we kinda agreed we're working on bram storker rules, so i re:read dracula and i noticed dracula has the ability to scale walls by turning into -lizard?- creature, and can turn into mists, obvs without DFRPG rules i can't really do mist form and shape changing but i had an idea so i can get the  'feel' without all the abilities.  **Vampric infiltration** (custom rule athletics exception) *This  mysterious power allows Vincent to enter spaces or traverse areas that might be inaccessible for a normal human, this might be by turning into a lizardish creature and scaling a high wall without footholds, or by appearing as mist and going through gap in the door or a grate.  Regardless of the method Vincent cannot go through solid objects, and the proccess is not instantaneous.*  Thoughts opinions?  
Rosefist	Man i love that as an idea, it could be done as a aspect i suppose my thoughts where it would be a bit too permenant for an aspect, from a power gaming prespective i wouldn't expect to get much use out it it, so it would make sense in a lot of ways.  But the game is more err mid era ankhmorporkesque so no ventilation systems.... course doesen't stop wards/holy artifacts or indeed air tight doors.
Rosefist	I thought about that and i kept going back and forth which is why i put it here, so i think i'll add that to the description see what the gm things.  I guess my internal debate was "is this more like tough as nails" or more like "back stab"
Rosefist	That would make sense, also all of his powers -stunts- linked to his vamprism... which turn off during sunlight as dracula's do I'm more or less treating this as a forced compel of his trouble.
Rosefist	heh that sounds like a good thin blood character concept(which one day i might do)
Rosefist	Hi i'm a visitor and a curious socialist (yeah i know) if there was an AMA opurtinity with somone nice, and paitent i'd love that.
Rosefist	Good advice tho for the TLDR I hate clan brujah, celerity using munchkin *****
Rosefist	[Character creation advice advice] [unusual setting] [Las new vegas] [neck beards need not apply] | So i'm about to be in a VTM game with an unusal setup.  Basically my GM's doing a setting where we're victims in a diner, of a sabbat mass embrace.  He's said we're not so much 'chosen' as embraced as a strategic distraction.  we can be any clan minus baali and blood brothers -i've mentally added some of the exinct clans to that list-.  Can you help me with a character without getting to lore heavy on me, i'm not a VTM expert but i know some liberties are being taken with the setting, as is his gmular right, and i don't wanna hear too much about the intricacies of court politics or how the cammies actually treat sabbat.  Thank you.
Rosefist	Hey i'm not GAD but i have a managable anxieity disorder, i was agoraphobic (extremely for about a year, now minus subways and stair wells i'm fine)  I'm not the best person to give advice, but honestily, you need to talk to him and just be honest, you can do it over text.  I think you have to explain it as you had some insecurities about your appearance, so you lied and he might be annoyed, but you need to resolve it and you will feel better if it's resolved.  maybe try writing down what you wanna say for the conversation first, predicting things he'll want to know, that'll give you more control of the sitaution  I honestily can't tell you how this will go, but i will say this: guys arn't what we're made out to be -at least all of us arn't- we're not all looking for super models and althought i can't see you i'm sure you look just fine, people bully becuase they can and they'll take anything they can get wether or not a fault exists or not.     And if it dosne't work out, i'm sorry but i'm sure you'll be okay in the long run.
Rosefist	Wife and Mom the great clash | In this case 'mom' is a bit of a lie it's an aunt whose probably the closet thing i have to a parent.  I think i'm half looking to rant half looking for some wisdom.  I've just got back from the holiday form hell, we where staying with my aunt for about about 4 days and things where going okay but tensions started rising beetween my wife and aunt.  Theyre where several mini conflicts which it's too boring to get into but it really comes down to: my aun's at her worst is critical (without realizing i *i think*) tends to lack a vocal filter, and cannot stop, my wife at her worst is is prone to outburts, a little conservative -socially- and hates it when plans are changed even in minor ways.  The problem is I love them both and from my point of view my aunt tends to push buttons on other and my wife reacts badly to have buttons pushed even a little, ideally i'd wish they'd both been better to each other but its hard to judge, i think future plans are basically (avoid and minimize contact)  any advice ?  
Rosefist	"You CAN choose to say this manifests as a racist rich person, but don't say that's what the Bloodline represents." at not point did i say it did.  I would never be so arrogant to tell a player how the thematic elements of a class/bloodline/religion should be represented.
Rosefist	[pathfinder] [rise of the rune lords] [character creation advise] [imperious bloodline sorceror] | So i should probably begin by saying im not DND pathfinder noob but eqully i don't know every thing triat/feat/abilityrule by heart.  I'm playing the the ROTL game my character died, so i'm rolling up an imperious bloodline sorceror [link: http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodlines-from-paizo/racial-bloodlines/imperious-bloodline-sorcerer-human]  Im looking for some optimization help or at least some 'avoiding being useless' help, with refference to traits, feats and maybe even spells.  Im not willing to negotiate the bloodline, and i have to be human to pick it, this is becuase i have character concept for this bloodline i love (basically racist rich fallen noble looking to gain a reputation and rule)
Rosefist	Thank you very much!  I must admit i'd always looked at thosse traits i also picked up the flaw "Xeonophobic" and took dominator for a +5 to demoralize even before i add my skill.  I will defiently pick up blistering insentive! i probably will pick up good gope, technically there are 2 sorcerors in the group ,but the party needs a little more arcane what with all his arcane archer levels cramping his arcane style.  I think illl go for controller/buffer with more of an emphaize on buffing, seems to work with a theme 'e.g almost a bard'
Rosefist	oh other infeo 16,000 GP level 8. party: hald elfarcane archer, Halfing rogue, and palladin.
Rosefist	i'm particually interested ib making good use of the bloodline aracana  "Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a harmful spell, you gain a bonus equal to the spell's level on Intimidate checks made against any creature adversely effected by that spell until the end of your next turn. Adversely effected typically means damage, but it can also mean debilitating effects or conditions."

SweetMeika	It's a *Cucumis metuliferus*, or Kiwano or Horned Melon.  From Wikipedia:  "Kiwano is a traditional food plant in Africa. Along with the Gemsbok cucumber (Acanthosicyos naudinianus) and Tsamma (Citron melon) it is one of the few sources of water during the dry season in the Kalahari Desert.  In northern Zimbabwe it is called gaka or gakachika, and is primarily used as a snack or salad, and rarely for decoration. It can be eaten at any stage of ripening, but when overripened, will burst forcefully to release seeds."

SweetMeika	"Toodaloo!"  This is the nicest I think I've seen her be to someone who was completely wrong.
SweetMeika	*Insert "If you can't handle me at my worst..." quote here*.
SweetMeika	Daaaaaaaaaarryl...  Daaaaaaaaaarryl...  Daaaaaaaaaarryl...  Daaaaaaaaaarryl...
SweetMeika	Get two pairs if you can, just in case.
SweetMeika	Does it come with a bayonet? So we can slice the pizza afterwards?
SweetMeika	fite me bro
SweetMeika	Mine too.

Sentrolyx	Euphoric also has purely happy tracks with major chords, got a [huge playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmu8ZghC80YaOrHiXSr-2tZoMAujYEcBZ) of just that on Youtube.  Also started a [Big Room Hardstyle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmu8ZghC80YbR2T-rwp-AGx8vL7InnsVk) playlist a couple months ago, not knowing it was actually a thing.  Excellent that we now have an official definition for X-Tra Raw: Kicks are gated & **HARD AS FUCK**, kickrolls become **lethal** and the screeches get **deadly**.

Sentrolyx	Man I wish I had Fox News, all I have is fuckin CNN. Comparing the 2 is like day & night it's unbelievable.
Sentrolyx	Yeah I have Fox, not Fox News. I'm in Canada, still on the old free analog cable system.
Sentrolyx	Thanx but I'm not using Flash anymore, got sick of them constantly requiring me to update it every month. It's like they don't know what the fuck they're doing. HTML5 ftw.
Sentrolyx	They're quoting the FBI insider.

Sentrolyx	Spotify yesterday kept going after I finished listening to an album. There was a message I think it said Spotify keeps playing tracks it thinks you might like, you can turn it off though. So if you add all these to your favorites, you might get more like that idk.
Sentrolyx	Check out Soundiiz, it does playlist conversions between several different services, including text files.
Sentrolyx	Those 4 paragraphs surpassed my expectations =)
Sentrolyx	2 favorite Big Room tracks lately, very uplifting...  [Norman Doray - All In (Olin Batista Extended Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG07h5aSCQM)   [Third Party - Veins (Club Mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IgsGEvH0WQ)
Sentrolyx	It's /u/ssvherz2 but he deleted that too.
Sentrolyx	Got it edited with the 1st climax coming back again right after the 2nd one: [Crypsis & Chain Reaction - Furious (Act Of Rage Remix) [MINUS042] [SG Edit]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/me6fpo1smieciwe/Crypsis%20%26%20Chain%20Reaction%20-%20Furious%20%28Act%20Of%20Rage%20Remix%29%20%5BMINUS042%5D%20%5BSG%20Edit%5D.mp3?dl=0)
Sentrolyx	Is that a trigger in your pocket or you just happy to see me | 
Sentrolyx	LOL The only mix I did from 2 years ago was muted but it works now. What's different is it wasn't done in real-time, I used Adobe Audition to surgically remove every intro/outro with fast fade-ins/fade-outs. — Best of Horror Hardstyle 2013-14 90-Minute mix w/ Horror Video Game Slideshow in 1080P | 
Sentrolyx	Yeah, his YT avatar.
Sentrolyx	And if we can't find a Hardstyle chick for the background then fuck it: https://yt3.ggpht.com/-s4_A2ewDVao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/26FmgmVJqts/s1080-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg  (full homo)
Sentrolyx	At 12 right now but this wouldn't be accurate, it's 12 + (40 - 12) / 2 = 26. So 26 people want Taylor (don't mind the nerd doing math in the corner =P).  Wouldn't mind having a permanent hot chick in the background greeting me everytime, it'd just be cool if she had something to do with Hardstyle though.  Also, after that could we go back to a new banner? feels like we've had the same for years. Also make it rotate like over at /r/The_Donald =P
Sentrolyx	[Shower thought] People jumping during Big Room drops would probably enjoy it more if it was Hardstyle... faster tempo which means you don't stay in the air as long, shorter jumps, less strenuous on the legs =P | 
Sentrolyx	Some of em can come pretty close, listen to the drops...  [Pitchback x Jake Sgarlato - Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZFBuOGH9HE)   [PURARI & Centineo - Charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d83vdc-gG8U)
Sentrolyx	You laugh but I have a theory that this may be the case for a lot a people. I fell in love with it in my 30s, and that's specifically because I didn't even know it existed before then, even though I'd been listening to a few different EDM genres for over 10 years.  I had heard a few Gabber tracks in my early 20s and liked it but thought the genre sorta died or something.
Sentrolyx	No that's not true because... just because ok? XP
Sentrolyx	BRH = Big Room House I presume. I know some people say Bigroom instead of Big Room but Beatport added it as a genre last year and they just call it "Big Room" w/o the "House" part.
Sentrolyx	The search function on Windows kinda started to suck IMO after Windows XP, but [Everything](http://voidtools.com/) does an amazing job, if you want to bring up all the files within all subfolders of a certain folder.  It even has Context Menu option, so you just right click on said folder then click Search Everything. And you can also add *.mp3 in the search field after that if you want.
Sentrolyx	I often use "A.F.5 Rename your files" (free) to clean up file names and make them prettier, like automatically replace all "_" with a space instead and also capitalizing the first letter of each word.  I'm also pretty sure Soundiiz wouldn't find it if you left the numbers and dash at the beginning of each line.
Sentrolyx	KSHMR drops a SECOND Hardstyle track during his set... DVBBS & Borgeous - Tsunami (Jay Cosmic Remix / Borgeous Edit) | 
Sentrolyx	I find "Directory List & Print Pro" very useful in saving all your file names into one text file. Tons of options depending on how you want the result organized. If you do it, it probably won't fit in a post, maybe use pastebin.com.  And if you generate a file with only "Artist - Title" on each line and nothing else, you can upload it to Soundiiz and have it make a YT playlist for you. Over 90% accurate I think. Biggest YT playlist I've seen had over 4000 videos, I don't know what the limit is.
Sentrolyx	Can someone please find this track, it haunts me | I can't remember the artist or anything about the melody, just that there's a kick like Boom - Boom - Boom, then the kick goes crazy like Ba-Da-Ba-Da-Boom, and there's like distortion, and a noise, like a pop, like a big pop like... POOF! or BOING! And oh yeah, there's farm animals in it, like a LOT of farm animals.
Sentrolyx	YES, that's the one!

Sentrolyx	How do you go about demonstrating in an effective way that Trump only has an enormous positive influence in his country.

Sentrolyx	I'd like to know about all the label channels or event channels on Youtube that are currently active. I've got these so far. What else? | 
Energyzer	Mind sharing what the screensaver is called? unless its part of windows lol
Energyzer	Welp, guess NHL got what they wanted in the end.
Energyzer	we've also been limited to 32 bit platforms
Energyzer	makeup call for the missed on in the first period i suppose.
Energyzer	could have gone either way but probably more towards a good call just a annoying one
Energyzer	only if the preds would tie it.
Energyzer	hell of a player is overestimated :D
Energyzer	i wish you all good luck, were all counting on you. Crush Crosbys dreams of another cup and make NBCSN and Pierre cry!
Energyzer	SHOOOOOOOOOOOOT
Energyzer	Cant wait for Wednesday Night rivalry and hear pierre cry when pens get ELIMINATED!
Energyzer	so about that whole trading Ovie and Backstrom thing
Energyzer	holtby just dove into that puck like it was his favourite cookie
Energyzer	let the butt clenching begin
Energyzer	about backstrom ;)
Energyzer	what if i told you shittenkirk was gonna score
Energyzer	i literally said to myself, pls no take shatty away from this pp... WELL PLAYED 
Energyzer	i cast nr. 2
Energyzer	After that first period, how is it even possible to be down 6 :( caps pls
Energyzer	NHL hates the Capitals :(
Energyzer	since he didn't get pulled after that goal, small chance probably
Energyzer	Can we please have puck control :(
Energyzer	call dr.phil
Energyzer	Probably filled with pictures of crosby and toews :D
Energyzer	Washington got some pressure in the Toronto zone quick give them a penalty.
Energyzer	Don't you dare move that note now
Energyzer	watch it be interference
Energyzer	it is the Pens.
Energyzer	There was a little bit of blood on the ice, not much tho
Energyzer	watch Toronto get out in the first round and giggle.
Energyzer	Capitals, lets get Ovechkin that cup.
Energyzer	Glad the shitshow of a season is over, sad that theres no more wings game untill september, what am i supposed to do untill then :(((
Energyzer	washington, but if leafs goes through guess i'll follow them since theyre on a roll right now, also cos they got babs and shanahan :(
Energyzer	Dammit thanks NHL for the blackout :(
Energyzer	Anyone got a picture of the players raising their sticks at the closing end ? | Title. also the FEELS :( what do now until october.
Energyzer	''Im loving it!! holy moly.''
Energyzer	imagine if journey themself are there :D
Energyzer	Quest complete sound | Just noticed the sound for completing the quest isnt the classic wow one :( blizzard please.
Energyzer	Ive used Affinitys ui with my own tweaks to it for quite awhile simply because of the custom filters hes done and most importantly turtle buffs! not saying you should get it but you can use it for inspiration to a lot of tweaks. as a general tip that i like personally is turning off the combat text that appears above a targets head, frees up a lot of not really necessary clutter if you already have a mod like xCT+, 
Energyzer	its k tho, we in tank mode
Energyzer	Blashill: ''Whats a timeout again?''
Energyzer	This almost feels like one of the playoffs games we had last year lol
Energyzer	wanna exchange some defence? :/
Energyzer	So it looks like Mantha is out for the season :(((...well whats left of it.
Energyzer	haven't tried Lazy Man ? :P
Energyzer	Go get them. | Winger fan here, we had some fun games these past two days despite the uneventful ending of the first game. Our season is very well over but i hope you guys can squeeze into the playoffs and make the leafs and bruins suffer :D Good luck on ya and nice sportsmanship out there!
Energyzer	Tampa on thursday then leafs after that.
Energyzer	If he for sure was chanting LGRW at that moment, i don't consider him a wings fan anymore with that lack of respect. Yes I'm a wings fan too and hope for all good that Lack is gonna be okay, we know what its like seeing our goalie being carried out.
Energyzer	i step away from the game for 5 mins and we got 2 goals?? what just happened
Energyzer	coil whine intensifies*
Energyzer	Ref: ''here you go have a win.''
Energyzer	Gloss white with a touch of pearlescent blue.
Energyzer	Im a big fan of white blue combinations in general :P
Energyzer	Mantha with the Datsyuk moves
Energyzer	Not sure if this has been asked before regarding the new puzzles | Before i get to it, a apologize if this has been asked before hand but i looked around and couldnt really find a official answer, so.  The puzzles for the new melee weapons from the dlc, are they to be obtained ONLY from the dlc battlepacks or do we think its for all battlepacks to come ? (prob would make more sense)  Wondering if i have to blow all my scrap and try get the saber done :p
Energyzer	You know lets not take a timeout.
Energyzer	So soft you won't notice
Energyzer	Lord all migthy the white/blue one :O i need to change pants now thanks!
Energyzer	Looks great!  Specs ?
Energyzer	Have you installed all of the simconnect installers from the redist folder in p3d ? that fixed it for me couple of weeks ago.
Energyzer	or a retiring lol
Energyzer	Maybe the goal post on the right is cursed and its our turn now?... maybe... please
Energyzer	It's not but its the most money can buy that would be used in a gaming pc :P
Energyzer	CPU: 6950X GPU: SLI 1080Ti's Peripherals: any RGB stuff preferably Razer Monitors: Acer XB271HK x4
Energyzer	love me some cling sounds
Energyzer	Mrazzle dazzled so hard  he tripped lol
Energyzer	They realized they were unlikely to make the playoffs, that or Holland took all the candy and they seek revenge
Energyzer	You got one :D
Energyzer	Crosby, against Detroit and its on NBC. God help me, time to unleash the drinks i feel
Energyzer	What a game, Well played you guys regardless of results!
Energyzer	It's my birthday today so a win here against the leagues best team would be the perfect gift. LGRW! :D
Energyzer	To be fair, the way our team has been playing the last 10 or so games we didnt deserve to win that game regardless of how you guys played :)
Energyzer	As if it was scripted! :D
Energyzer	TL;DW: Just your regular 2016-2017 Wings game. Nothing new to see here.
Energyzer	Need the new client
Energyzer	The only limitation you will have will be the game itself, as its 32 bit significant hardware changes doesn't improve performance by a whole lot.  Obviously the 1070 will render shadows and effects a lot faster than the 980 but perhaps not in a gain of 10-20+ fps. The i7 vs i5 will be interesting, as some users report that with hyper threading off P3D runs better for them (not for me personally) and as hyper threading is the big feature of the i7, if you're building the sim primarily for sim use and P3D'ing you can save a couple of $$ with an i5.  What I'm saying is, yes you're going to see a improvement over the old setup but maybe not a huge one as game limitation is holding you back.
Energyzer	That blonde behind Blash tho :o
Energyzer	Is Mrazek hurt or something ? with how he's been playing the last few games i cant see why they would play Coreau 
Energyzer	''I thought we played good in the first period, stepped it up in the 2nd and had some good chances in the 3rd but ended up struggling'' -Jeff Blashill
Energyzer	I love this team :D 
Energyzer	Tbh i gave up the playoffs hopes mid december with how theyre playing :P
Energyzer	Do you have FTX Vector ? if so you need to run the Auto-Elevation tool as thats what im suspecting is the issue.
Energyzer	Seems like Ken is too afraid to do it.
Energyzer	Even tho im a Wings fan and Caps being my 2nd team to watch. Good game fellas! :) its a shame our defense wasnt giving Mrazek a hand out there but didnt expect to win this one in all honesty.  Oh and Oshie is quite the shot!
Energyzer	Is it just me or does the Caps players aswell as the fan generally seem alot nicer than other teams? *Cough* Philly *Cough*
Energyzer	his face expressions are 10/10
Energyzer	My body is ready for the inevitable against the best team atm :s 
Energyzer	That power play tho
Energyzer	If by win you mean more evidence that Blash is shit, then yes. Winning the actual game? No :(
Energyzer	They were using stolen models and was trying to scam people.
Energyzer	Do i get the assets too if i donate Kappa
Energyzer	Is it just me or have CST removed everything A380 related on their FB page? Maybe they couldnt handle it all anymore :D
Energyzer	Nope, its the PTA Thopat shaders with some tweaking of my own.
Energyzer	Can we please allow the linesman to make calls aswell? Apparently its hard enough for the 2 refs to follow the puck and watch what happens around it instead of watching a different direction. Ugh
Energyzer	Descending into Heathrow on a afternoon | 
Energyzer	H100i v2, getting about mid 70s in p3d. 
Energyzer	what volt you running at ? i might back it down to 4.6 as 4.7 is a little bit too warm for my comfort zone. running at 1.26v
Energyzer	i7 4790K - 4.7 Ghz 16gb ram @ 1600mhz EVGA GTX 980ti SC+ OC'd  Im not running maxed out settings tho, somewhere inbetween medium-high. the VC fps hovers 25-30 and sometimes down to 15 when looking over london from the inside.  
Energyzer	P3D v3.4 - PMDG 747 V3 - ORBX OpenLC/Base/Vector - AS16+ASCA - PTA
Energyzer	If it even is from NLS ;)
Energyzer	i believe fsx and p3d only uses 1 core atm (unsure about XP10/11) so yes a quad core per say wouldnt be of huge benefit but outside of the game everything else would be smoother and faster on the quad core as even tho the speeds may be the same, a dual core is still a dual core.

pleth0ra	This is a good [album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nClkHfHppgsv4Hv7fIEDf) on Spotify. I enjoy a lot of stuff by Total Fitness Workout too.
pleth0ra	I remember when the Pokemon cards first came out. Every Friday a lot of the kids in my apartments would meet at the playground to trade cards. This one kid always had Japanese cards and since they were ahead in the booster packs, everybody always wanted to trade him lol.
pleth0ra	Yeah, the prep to consumption time ratio is a little off.
pleth0ra	I tried playing Zestiria after beating Berseria and I couldn't keep playing it. Just because I heard some of the characters in Berseria made an appearance in Zestiria. The voice acting isn't very good and I couldn't get behind a lot of the mechanics. The combat was still pretty good but didn't outweigh all the negatives about the game. Seeing that Berseria was so much better, imo, it kind of ruined Zestiria for me.

pleth0ra	[AZ] Targeted Bullying at work eventually leading to Demotion/pay cut | Back in June I moved from Vermont to AZ so I can continue school and earn my Degree. I worked at a retail company in VT and upon learning that I was able to transfer to my same position in AZ I decided to do that. Before transferring my manager contacted the District Manager in Arizona to make sure I would have the position even with my school schedule, which started at the end of August.   He said I would have the position and wasn't sure to which location I would be transferring to and would call me back within 3 days. The third day came by and I still did not receive a call from the DM, so I talked to my manager, who called his boss and talked to that DM about it, seeing that this was also the day before I started my drive from VT to AZ. Eventually I got my location and drove to AZ.    A couple weeks after working my new location we got a new Store Manager there. Upon the arrival of the SM the DM was there as well and gave the SM a tour of our store. When the SM and DM arrived to my department to talk with me they were immediately giving me grief about my sales numbers, which were totally fine, they were lower than target by 2% when other stores were as low as 8%, and how I wasn't going to be able to handle this position let alone going to school as well. I have had this position for 1 year and a half before transferring to AZ location and before hand my number were excellent and I received a lot of praise from my superiors.   These sort of interactions continued throughout the course of the months that followed. When I would close the store manager would constantly belittle me through a condescending attitude or at times a blunt manner. Several of these interactions were so bad that I cried in the bathroom or had a panic attack from the stress of it all. Seeing that I moved here with no family or friends, they were all back east, I became friends with one of the other managers at this location. We continued to be friends throughout the next couple of months.   Last week the SM calls me into the office saying "I have something to show you." When I get into the office the SM has the DM on the phone and they are confronting me about being friends with the other manager at work and that I was going to lose my manager position because of that. I told them that we were just friends and nothing else and that managers of our level can be friends outside of work and that the handbook does not forbid it. They said it does not matter and that any relationship between managers is not allowed. By this point I was fed up with arguing between the two of them and just asked what was. Now they said because of my school schedule and how it was impacting work and making more work for the other employees, which was not noted or said by any of the employees themselves, I had 30 days to either quit or receive a pay cut and take a Part Time position. Even tho I had told the DM that I was going to be going to school and he agreed beforehand, now the DM says "I never received your school schedule before you transferred." I told them that I could not survive on a PT position and they just said "Sorry." So that is pretty much the jist of it.   Personally I think that because the DM handled my transfer so poorly that I had to talk to my VT SM about it who called his boss to have to talk to the DM might have been the reasoning behind me being targeted like this. So I am just wondering if their actions were justified? Is there anything that I can do or do I just have to accept it and move on?
pleth0ra	Sadly this is exactly is what's happening at my job right now. Had a new manager come in at the start of June and now she has already made one manager quit and is working on the next person.

pleth0ra	This reminds me of when I was little and me and sister were stuck playing super Mario Bros 3. We got stuck on the water world level with the big fish that swims on the bottom of the level. We were friends with the neighbors daughter and her mom would play SMB3 a lot. We would often spy on her through the window as she played and we watched her beat the level we were stuck on and we both were like "oh my God, she beat that level!" We said that really loud and she looked out the window and saw us. We ran. Even after watching her beat the level we still couldn't beat it ourselves.

pleth0ra	Looks pretty awesome from the trailer. I wonder if it was only the one racing truck that was in the Forza 6 DLC that will be in the game. Also I'm intrigued with the customizable drivers that he mentioned. By the looks in the video, looked like some decent helmet choices. Hopefully they slowly roll out gameplay and stuff like the did for Forza 6.

pleth0ra	Just finished it the other day and it easily became my new favorite Tales game. Solid combat, excellent story and awesome characters. Only downside to Berseria is that all the good outfits are DLC instead of side quests. Tales of Graces f was my old favorite, mainly because how good the combat was and the excellent side quests. The story was okay, very predictable. Zesteria, in my opinion, is the worst Tales game. I couldn't even finish the game.

AvoidMySnipes	What kind of camera? My cousin bought the D3400 DSLR camera and has barely used it lol.
AvoidMySnipes	Jeez.. What in the world makes the jacket so costly??? Got a link?
AvoidMySnipes	😂 How many of those do you still play?
AvoidMySnipes	Jeez, what's it made of??  Got a link to it online lol?
AvoidMySnipes	I feel you on that. I'm on my third year, but ever since freshman year I haven't bought one. Now I just get raped by Pearson and their Mastering series.
AvoidMySnipes	Haha thanks! Can't think straight lol {4]
AvoidMySnipes	What?? Man you gotta go to parties more! Hell, go with parents to a formal party.  Always be excited to wear a suit!
AvoidMySnipes	Have to ask; what did you study and what do you do now?
AvoidMySnipes	Well hey, find a spot that's on r/EarthPorn and relate the words with Sussex or something in the title, or hell, Google awesome camping spots in Sussex and just go!
AvoidMySnipes	At least the you can start counting the days as you go lol

AvoidMySnipes	My man!
AvoidMySnipes	If you're close to me I might just buy it from you lol
AvoidMySnipes	Choose:  One day? Or day one?  This is what motivates me to the gym lol. If I keep saying I'll go one day, it may never come. That's why you just gotta tell yourself it's gonna be day one today and go at it. :) Best of luck!
AvoidMySnipes	Tell him you can stream allllllll of that online. If anything, you can just spend $300-$400 on the new Apple TV (assuming you all have iPhones), and connect it to the TV via wifi no problem 👍
AvoidMySnipes	I bought one as well. Expensive af and still paying it off lol
AvoidMySnipes	I tried keeping a tablet... Rarely used it also. I feel like the only thing I might even consider using is an iPad. Never owned one, and probably never will though :)

AvoidMySnipes	Can you explain this? I'm high... I love theoretical physics and astrophysics and I should know the reason. Is it because the light is 6,000 years old and is now getting to us going the speed of light? But my question to you is, how long will we be able yo take pictures of it? 6,000 years from 1995 because the light stopped "sending" to Earth?

Analytical-critic-44	Togami's development was written better than Fuyuhiko's.
Analytical-critic-44	Naegi is an uninteresting character who pales in comparison to Hajime as a protagonist. Not to mention, his treatment in the later entries and how he is viewed as our lord and savior is obnoxious.  People find Celeste to be a disappointing character because of how idiotic her murder plan was and how it doesn't live up to the potential built around her. She also gets some hatred for her motives.
Analytical-critic-44	Eh, it depends. In DR1, I think the girls are way better than the boys. The male cast was *really* weak, since I dislike half of them. In DR2, I like the boys and girls almost equally. However, the V3 boys completely blows the girls out of the water!  
Analytical-critic-44	Shirogane, I really like the concept behind her character, but she wasn't executed well in the game. [V3 Spoilers](/s "While her character was written to be so bland that you would not suspect her due to not even remembering her, she was just so boring and unentertaining to the point that I simply did not care about her character anymore by the time she was revealed as the mastermind.")
Analytical-critic-44	I'm going to miss Mikan...  Can Makoto just leave now?
Analytical-critic-44	What do you think is Danganronpa's biggest strength and flaw? | Strength: Element of surprise for when you first play the game. With a cast of 15/16 students, the player won't know who will die and when in the game. This raises the tension for your favorite characters in hoping that they will live as well as who you spend your free time with. This feeling makes for a suspenseful and exciting experience.  Flaw: Anything anime. The DR1 adaptation was a rushed story that made it hard to care about the characters with what little depth they were given. DR3 was a terribly written conclusion to the Hope's Peak saga that ruined DR2's story and ending.
Analytical-critic-44	What does this mean?
Analytical-critic-44	DR2 is just a better overall game. It has a better cast, better mysteries, better music, better gameplay, and a better story. 
Analytical-critic-44	Does that mean your birthday is the release of V3?

Analytical-critic-44	I like Ruruka and found her to be a complex and intriguing character. It's sad because had she got her character arc, she would have been better received here.  [V3](/s "I love Shinguuji a lot, but I think his reception has been improving a bit ever since the English poll")
Analytical-critic-44	The judge's name? Alburns Biblestein!
Analytical-critic-44	[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/5z8kxr/the_results_of_the_danganronpa_v3_character_poll/)  Should be noted that these opinions will surely change when the game releases in English.
Analytical-critic-44	The only ones who I dislike that have a good amount of fans are Makoto and Souda.  EDIT: Oh and Ryota too. What is there to like about him? How could someone look at his journey through DR3 from when he did jack in the first 11 episodes of Future Arc to how he hogged all of the screen time in Despair Arc to how he was responsible for the worst plot point in the series to how he became a selfish coward who doesn't learn from his mistakes in Hope Arc and say he was the best character from it? I am sorry, but Ryota's character is a train wreck.

Analytical-critic-44	Danganronpa V4: all of the males get a recognizable bulge.
Analytical-critic-44	The next bara will have a bulge that takes up 2/3 of his entire waist. He will have an erection in all of his sprites that pushes against his skin tight pants to the point where the player can see a detailed outline of his genitals. His entire archetype revolves around the size of his penis and makes open comparisons to the other boy's bulges. Anything is possible if it's fictional.
Analytical-critic-44	I love that little one looking over the bigger dogs sprawled out across the floor.
Analytical-critic-44	> That's all fair. I guess I didn't notice as much because I was never a huge fan of Asahina and Kirigiri, but you are completely right as I now realize. I still do like Makoto more though as his optimism just felt nicer this time around and made him more endearing to me  There were some good parts of Makoto in the anime. I like how he built up the courage to face Munakata and trick him with his NG code for instance. My hatred mainly comes from how the narrative treats him rather than what he does.  > What I hate is the "complex motives" meme people use to make fun of Tengan--when the villain that the meme is based off of has motives that are way more sensical than Tengan's plan  I didn't even know that was a meme! While I have never played Zero Escape, I can't imagine it's villain topping someone like Tengan.  
Analytical-critic-44	I first want to start off by appreciating how well you cover the anime in providing long and detailed reasoning. With that out of the way, here's my thoughts:  I love how the anime setup the dates in between the episodes. It gave people only a couple of days to wait in between episodes and brought a nice and convenient pace to the discussions about each episode. Giving us enough time to analyze the character's actions and predictions on the plot, but not too much where we just wait.  Part of your reasoning for Gozu's death brings up a bigger problem in the Future Arc, which is how the general mysteries in the anime were predicted long before the resolutions appeared(Izayoi's killer, the identity of the attacker, when someone was going to die)  I disagree about Junko's abilities because I felt that her manipulative and charismatic skills was part of the appeal for her and could make sense in a universe like Danganronpa.  You said it great in how the anime lies to the audience in what each of the arcs were about, primarily the Despair Arc. It worsens my opinion on who actually gets most of the screen time but I'll save that for the characters.  The Hope Arc is the biggest insult to the series, completely undoing the tension behind SDR2 and its themes about facing consequences since no one is distraught over the events of the game or them ending the world. The whole writing behind that episode sounded like some fanfic.  Future Arc's biggest problem is how most of the mysteries are either underwhelming or just straight up forgotten. Who was the 13th branch leader? What was the point of bringing Monaca in the picture? Why bring in a plot that foreshadows the death of one of the DR1 characters when they don't even have the balls to go through with it?!?! Terrible writing. Most importantly of all on that note is how none of the original characters die! Not only is it weak on the writers, but it makes the entire DR3 cast seem as nothing but insignificant plot devices to make the DR1 crew look good.  I will continue character discussions on the next post.          
Analytical-critic-44	What is your biggest fear? | 
Analytical-critic-44	Sorry, but I despised Makoto in DR3. I hated how the narrative made him out to be always right and anyone who so much as disagrees either died or became outcasted(Munakata). I hated how Kirigiri and Asahina were reduced to devices to benefit him. All that Asahina did was carry Makoto around from danger since he couldn't run and when he finally could, she was shot and left behind. Kirigiri sacrificed herself because it would give Makoto the courage to face Munakata and when that was settled, she was revived through nonsensical writing all to become his literal trophy wife. Admittedly I never cared for him in DR1 because he didn't have much depth and a character arc, but the direction they took with his character in the anime was horrid.  I also strongly hate Mitarai, and found him to be one of the two characters that symbolize all the flaws with the anime. His character is the origin for the despair brainwashing and he was given too much screen time at the expense of most of the DR3 and DR2 cast who needed it. He's underdeveloped, unlivable, and just a waste of material that other parts of the anime needed.  Tengan is the other character that ruined DR3. The entire writing behind him is just nonsense and makes for a disappointing resolution to the killing game.  Ruruka is probably the most interesting and complex character, but was badly used in the story. She should have survived since her death made the class 76 trio pointless in the end.  Kizakura is cool and kept me interested whenever he appeared, but he doesn't have much depth. Still one of the best characters from the cast.  Juzo is my favorite. He was the only character who had a fulfilling character arc in the anime and I have come to understand his actions upon reflection.  Chisa and Munakata were both characters I enjoyed throughout the anime, but I was disappointed by how they ended up. Chisa became a hope slut who was anticlimactically killed off and Munakata became a plot device to make Makoto look good.  Izayoi, Gozu, Bandai, and Miaya all have the bare minimum of depth and personality to the point that I can't even consider them a character.

Analytical-critic-44	Considering how most of the murderers in the series set up a red herring in their crimes, what would your thoughts be on a murderer who intentionally made themselves a "red herring"? For example, Himiko is the actual culprit in case 2, and left little pieces of evidence that will lead the cast to suspect Kirumi as the killer. You go into the trial with everyone suspecting Himiko, but then Saihara proves her "innocence"(mainly with fabricated evidence that she sorted out). After that, as the planning behind the murder unfolds, you are led to believe Kirumi as the culprit. I feel that it's a great way to subvert the player's expectations of how trials normally go in the games and who the real killer is since I feel that no one believed characters like Toko, Hagakure, and Hiyoko were the culprits when they were set up to be.

As we already know, Aoi has a crush on Makoto if you do her FTE's. It has already been shown throughout AE that Komaru has a brother complex and thinks highly of Makoto's success, so it would make sense that she would worry about losing Aoi to him. It would hurt her confidence had Makoto, someone who she envies, swooped in and take her crush away from her. Because of this paranoia, she could have easily drugged Aoi for her own desires. Treat Aoi like her "possession".

Analytical-critic-44	My favorite character in the game and the series is definitely Togami. I am a huge fan of the "rival" archetype and find characters like him and Komaeda to be a big factor of my enjoyment for these games. Alongside that, I love his snarky attitude and dynamic with the rest of the cast and found him to be the funniest character from the game.

Analytical-critic-44	Hifumi, he already has the ahoge so he's set!
Analytical-critic-44	Celes without a doubt. To have someone with the nickname of "The Queen of Liars" and is presented as a cunning and intelligent threat end up with such an obvious and poorly thought out murder case is disappointing.   I could have given her a pass because the point of all the mistakes she made was supposed to represent how she is not as great as she tries to present herself. However, she was part of a game where all the murders were easy to guess. Every single murder was obvious to me. Even Mondo's murder, which the game pushed so hard for you to fall for a red herring, was not that difficult if you use inductive reasoning with who could have worked out with Chihiro and use a dumbbell to kill him. If she was one of the only cases in the game where the mistakes were obvious against Celes, then I would be fine. Having every murder case be obvious though hurts her character a lot and leaves me disappointed in what could have been an exciting murder case from DR1.  Celes presents herself as an intimidating and manipulative threat to the player. Her design, personality, and voice intrigued me in what she would do or say next. However, her character ultimately ended up as wasted potential because of how anticlimactic her case felt in a game filled with easy murders.
Analytical-critic-44	You said it perfectly. In DR2 and V3, the cases became more and more complex as the story progressed. To have Celes be the case 3 culprit and still stick with her plan, it would be a great subversion of the players expectations for difficulty in games as well as Celes herself. To have someone who portrays herself as a cunning puppet master create a plan that is lackluster and clumsy when compared to the crafty plans of the supposedly "dumb" and "ordinary" students is a fantastic idea!
Analytical-critic-44	I swear that these people look at kin the same way that some would look to feminism. It sounds less like them being genuinely delusional and psychotic and more them just trying to find a way to excuse their personal failures and try to find a way to escape from social situations because they are so uncomfortable with reality.
Analytical-critic-44	I don't consider Tsumugi to be a culprit since she never got an execution for being found out as a murderer. She killed Rantaro, but the first case's culprit was Kaede.  However Kaede does *participate* in a rebuttal showdown. She wasn't the one who made the rebuttal but she *participated* in the showdown with Hoshi.
Analytical-critic-44	Hmmm, I wonder if this foreshadows her role in the story?
TheSlyGuy1	What would be found in a Badwill store? | 
TheSlyGuy1	lol look at the top post on the thread
TheSlyGuy1	Really great job setting this up, and having it run so smoothly!
TheSlyGuy1	Awesome job!  You are part of an exclusive club, I estimate only a few dozen people have ever gotten a R1 Tyson TKO
TheSlyGuy1	Wow, thanks for saying all of this :)
TheSlyGuy1	I do!  Glad you enjoyed /u/Nintendominance
TheSlyGuy1	The most popular games happen to be non-violent for the most part, so that's why.
TheSlyGuy1	It's because I had to use OBS to record this video from my editing software's preview window, since the encoding feature didn't work for whatever reason.
TheSlyGuy1	Pretty sure they still accept them.  I posted a quality test of a run on VHS, and they approved it and said it was good enough to submit.
TheSlyGuy1	Got a random copyright claim for a song I've used in previous videos, so I will be reuploading it tomorrow.
TheSlyGuy1	The "God Run" is almost always not the best pace you will ever be on.  No matter how good it seems, you have to realize how much the record for games change over the years- what seems like the best run ever now may seem like an average run in a year.  
TheSlyGuy1	I make those vids, glad to see you stumbled upon them!
TheSlyGuy1	I never said "nothing happened".  I said that there were a couple of runs that were cheated, because that is the information that I got from the Zelda speedrunners that I asked.  Maybe they weren't, but it sounds like they were to me, and I went with what the other Zelda runners thought too.
TheSlyGuy1	Yeah, most are from when I encoded it sadly :(
TheSlyGuy1	Probably the 1st time I've ever heard that complaint.
TheSlyGuy1	It's a TAS-only route that didn't lower the amount of stars that was needed to complete the game.  I wasn't really intending this to be a video about how the TAS of the game changed, but rather about how the human route did.  For 1/0 star, that started with TASers putting the first runs together.
TheSlyGuy1	I emailed them that they should play my videos on stream if they ever have a long time between runs.  They never responded.
TheSlyGuy1	This always happens when they do a No-Skips run of a mario kart game.  It gets bad reception, and then they put it in the schedule each year anyway. The commentary was very good though.  The runner/couch did the best they could've done IMO.
TheSlyGuy1	Using zips takes much more skill than not using them.
TheSlyGuy1	yeah...lol
TheSlyGuy1	Thanks :)

TheSlyGuy1	It's still ok to enjoy a film if it's inaccurate.  It does an amazing job of telling a story, even if parts of it aren't entirely true.
TheSlyGuy1	I encourage you to watch an interview of his, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yogBgrqY4FY).  He's a really down to earth guy.
TheSlyGuy1	This has already been posted.
TheSlyGuy1	[My videos sorta do that](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMxPYcr2zEkWInMyvvxmN22gjrRR0x__u)
TheSlyGuy1	I'll explain the joke to you-  These macaroons you made look delicious to most people, because of their excellent texture and our ability to imagine their taste because of it.  However, if you ignore the obvious color differences, macaroons and hamburgers actually look extremely similar to each other.  If these macaroons were supposed to be hamburgers, then based off of their overall brown appearance, one would wonder if they were either rotten or had something else wrong with them.  So, /u/theonewhomknocks is creating humor by pretending that they are rotten hamburgers, when in reality, it is obvious to most that they are not.
TheSlyGuy1	Ok but imagine if something bad DID happen to her, nobody would be talking about "overreacting".  Better safe than sorry.  
TheSlyGuy1	lol
TheSlyGuy1	Yes but she had 2 panels that she just skipped without telling a single person...
TheSlyGuy1	She skipped her 2 panels and told nobody.  I think sounding the alarm was fine.

TheSlyGuy1	what is going on with these comments?
TheSlyGuy1	I enjoyed the video too.  The first 3 people to comment each within 5 minutes of each other all said something that sounded like the title to a buzzfeed article.  The vid itself was cool Goose
TheSlyGuy1	I mean, I get complaints when I talk too much about a category, and complaints when I don't talk enough about it.  It's impossible to please everyone.
TheSlyGuy1	Ok, I guess I see what you're saying.  I agree I should've made it clearer that any% was now the wrong warp.
TheSlyGuy1	I was just doing the video on any% mainly.  If I ever do the longer categories in the future, Kirua would get more attention.
TheSlyGuy1	You said I didn't talk about the wrong warp enough.  Sounds relevant to me.  The feedback is appreciated though.
TheSlyGuy1	I'm gonna buy the fuck out of that book.
TheSlyGuy1	GG cheese, you're amazing.  This will go down as a landmark speedrun- one of the most important ones in history. 
TheSlyGuy1	Yes.

oishiiiii	I apologize in advance that I don't have exact measurements, but the recipe that I use is roughly as follows.  Sprinkle the meat with sugar. Let sit while making marinade. For the marinade, roughly chop an onion, maybe about a tbsp of ginger, and 7 to 10 cloves of garlic. Add some water and blend in a blender until everything is homogenous. Move to a bowl and add about a cup of soy sauce, I use Kikkomans. Add maybe a quarter cup of soju, or sake would work also. Add a few tbsp of sugar. Add some salt and pepper. Then just throw the meat into the marinade and mix around until everything's evenly coated. And as with most marinades, let the meat marinade for a day or two for maximum flavor.  Edit: I went ahead and found a better recipe from Maangchi's YouTube channel. These are probably better and more authentic...but my recipe tastes pretty damn good.  [LA Galbi](https://youtu.be/JAF3Bpy-AsY)  [Bulgogi](https://youtu.be/3qBjL_HGvco)  Second edit: I totally forgot, as the people below have mentioned, the sesame oil. I usually added just a tsp or so of it to the mixture after adding the marinade to the meat.

oishiiiii	If you're really into vocal trance, you should check out compilations by Amsterdam Trance Records. Look on beatport, some of them are also available on torrent. Amsterdam Trance specializes in vocal trance. But these have quite a different feel than the albums you've listed in your OP.
oishiiiii	Took me 10 minutes -_-
oishiiiii	Fixed that for you.
oishiiiii	Definitely check out Future Sound Of Egypt Volumes 3, 2, and 1 for a good taste of FSOE's best releases since their inception. I'm also a huge fan of the Ministry of Sound's Trance Nation compilations, there's one mixed by Aly & Fila, another by Above & Beyond, and most recently one by Simon Patterson. Also, Bryan Kearney just released This Is Kearnage, a compilation mixed by himself and Will Atkinson. And at the end of this month FSOE is releasing a 3-CD FSOE 400 compilation so watch out for that, it's gonna be good.

oishiiiii	I agree that part of what makes trance great is the different layers and the subtleties in each track, but I don't know if I would discover new things after more than several listens...  I think you might really like Will Atkinson, especially his Subculture and FSOE releases. I always completely zone out when I listen to his music, because of all the nuances and subtle layers he has that add so much to every track. He's definitely one of the best trance producers right now.
oishiiiii	that's really strange, anyone else having this problem? we control the sunlight is the only video that's uploaded by a user, every other track is uploaded by the official owners (that way i know they won't be removed). maybe it's your region. sorry about that but it still works on my computer
oishiiiii	I was bored and made a YouTube playlist of every FSOE release in order, thought I'd share it with you guys. All tracks are full length versions. | [removed]
oishiiiii	yup, and that is SICK!!! congrats man, i can't wait to hear it and i'll definitely buy it on beatport!
oishiiiii	good point! totally forgot lol i'll add those in later. btw was super pleased to find out that you have a track coming up on always alive! my 2nd favorite label 
oishiiiii	The other day I played against someone who dropped Sylvanas turn 6, Dr. Boom turn 7, then Kel'Thuzad turn 8. I had to double check to make sure I was in arena.. then the next game I played a mage who dropped 3 flamestrikes in a row. Maybe they're not lucky, I'm just unlucky :/

She went in to patrol borders, to keep nations at peace. Over time, she started to lose her vision. Mercy noticed that she couldn't fix her eye lens without breaking her eyes, and glasses wouldn't work, so she came up with an ingenious way of fixing the problem. Immolation. By placing permanent regenerative biotics in her eyes, and igniting them, it fixed the lens in her eyes. When Overwatch disbanded, she requested being able to do this with her hands. -------------------- **Passive:** Fire Armor. Armor eqiupped quickly burns away (60 Damage per second, at an even rate.), when her health is injured, the armor instantly regenerates, does 10% damage to her health, and 90% of the damage to her armor.

Place Phoenix on an enemy, and if they die, any enemy in a 4m radius will be marked with Pheonix. Any attack dealt by any teammate marks deals 10% more damage. 8 Second Cooldown. Lasts for 10 seconds. -------------------- **Ability 2** Seraphim. Enemies 20 meters away or further cannot aim at you. This lasts until you get damaged. Cooldown: 20 Seconds. -------------------- **Ultimate** Alliance. 3 random allies gain your Seraphim power, and the group healer, (if there is no healer, or multiple healers, group leader) becomes invunerable. Lasts 15 Seconds.  -------------------- *Press 2 to chose which ultimate you want to use, you can't use both. -------------------- **Ultimate:** Firepower. Demonbane bow gets a burst fire of 6, incendiary damage is doubled.

Metroidfan808	E-nzo. An electricity sword wielding support hero. | An electrical engineer from Florence, Italy, he worked hard to create a cheap way of building houses. He came up with a way to use electroplating to do so. He had to fight both sides during the omnic crisis, staying neutral in his homeland. He uses Florentine Swords. Nobody knows his height, as he wears many varieties of clothes, but he is around 5'9.  He usually just puts "+" as his last name, to balance the charge.   Health- 100, armor, 100. Speed is the same as Sombra. Primary Fire: "-". A negatively charged blade. Deals 35 Damage, electroplating increases damage of "-". Range is 1.2X Genji's Dragonblade. Secondary Fire "+" A postively charged blade. Deals 35 Damage. Adds a "+" to the enemy that can steal armor when - is used.  Passive- E-le-ctropla++ting. Striking an enemy with "+", than "-"  steals 30 health, and gives 30 damage to "-". Striking an ally with "-", than "+" adds 30 health to the ally. Press 2 to switch sword charges.   Ability One-  Alternator. Dash forwards any distance to an enemy, or backwards( within a 30 Degree angle) to an ally, halving damage dealt, and charging your ultimate.. It alternates on which affect happens each use. This costs 10 armor, but has no cooldown.   Ability 2. Piezo. Cooldown - 8 Seconds.  Hold a crystal that absorbs all types damage taken for 3 seconds, and allows you to shoot a lighning bolt through "-" that deals 50 percent of damage taken back. The leftover rock can be thrown to charge 50 shields for any target.  Ultimate. Catalyst. Gives the entire team 100 Armor, additionally, electroplating now takes 60 health, and adds 60 damage to the swords when electroplated. This effect lasts 15 seconds.  Electroplating decreases movement speed by 5%, and 10% when the ultimate is used. It does not affect Alternator though.

Metroidfan808	Hunter, the master of Hunting techniques worldwide. | He is mysterious hero with no known birthplace, or real name. He is known for disarming entire militia.  150 Health, 50 armor.   Passive: Venom. Damage dealt increases the less you wait to fire. Disarming a target decreases enemy damage the longer they wait to fire.   Primary Fire: Binary Blowgun. Cannot headshot.  Fires two horizontal projectiles that are spaced apart.  Fire rate is 1/3 of Widowmaker's hip-fire when hip-firing, and 4/3 Widowmaker's fire rate when ADS. Projectiles deal 20 combined damage . This weapon has a magazine size of 5, and a reload of 2.5 Seconds.  Venom caps combined damage at 70, and goes down by 10 combined damage per half second. Reloading a completely empty magazine resets venom.  Venom takes away 5 damage per second on enemy weapons.   Shift: Chakram. Can be used while aiming down sights. Consumes 5 ammo. Deals 75  Damage. Stuns enemies that have venom applied.    Q: Pressure Plate. Cooldown: 12 Seconds. Duration: 3 Seconds. he pulls out a pressure pad that absorbs bullets. It increases fire rate by 1/2, and decreases reload speed by 1/2. The duration of the effect is double the time you take damage.   Ultimate. Bramble and Bracken. Gives one nearby ally 200 Shields, and another 300 Armor. Knock back for your allies is heavily increased. When allies take 100 Damage, you and the ally gain 5 second invisibility. When your allies shields or armor goes down, it ends for them. The armor is special, and cannot be regenerated by Mercy or Ana.

TheRealHooks	What technology would someone need to convince you they were from the future? | 
TheRealHooks	"Pics or it didn't happen"  Always applicable, except this time it's, "Pics or it won't happen."
TheRealHooks	Those aren't real, bruh. Just from the movies. Can we at least be realistic here?
TheRealHooks	My question is how you can do something for 40 hours a week and *not* make that some part of your identity or a point of pride?
TheRealHooks	Easy? No.  Easier? Yes.  I'm not particularly tall (6'1"), but the dating world is *definitely* easier over 6' than for a guy who's 5'5".
TheRealHooks	I'm glad you can do that.  Most people just don't compartmentalize as well as you seem to.  My hobbies are also miles away from what my work is, but my work is still a substantial part of my life that I can't pretend isn't any part of me.
TheRealHooks	Good.  I'm happy for you.  I'm just saying if a man were to get on Tinder or something like that and create two of the *exact same* profile, with the only difference that one says 6'2" and the other says 5'2", he'd get very different results.  
TheRealHooks	I haven't, but I've been asked enough times how tall I was and met with a, "Ok thank god" or something to that effect when I said I was over 6'.  Obviously not all women think this way, but there's no denying that on average, women prefer men who are above average height.
TheRealHooks	The "oh thank god" response is a pretty good indicator they might be shallow, but there's nothing wrong with having physical preferences.  Everybody has them, and height is just one of the many.
TheRealHooks	I read it correctly. I was just making a joke.
TheRealHooks	Almost every dating scenario *begins* with physical attraction. I'm not arguing that physical attributes are the sole factor, especially not height alone, but each factor makes a difference one way or another.
TheRealHooks	I'm not complaining. If anything, the opposite
TheRealHooks	If arm wrestling interests you, I suggest looking up Devon Larrat. He's the best in the world and pretty technical about it.  There's a video of him taking down the Mountain pretty easily (who outweighs him by 150 lbs), and another video of him taking Marcellus Wiley while Wiley uses two hands.   John Brzenk is another to look up. He's the greatest of all time without a doubt. Then there's Travis Bagent, the loudest and best lefty of all time.  There's a documentary called "Pulling John" about Brzenk and some of his rivals, and it's actually really good.
TheRealHooks	When you get to the 6'3 or 6'4 range, you start to be "the tall guy" rather than just being above average.
TheRealHooks	I think you can definitely extrapolate that dating is easier when you're tall (but not "Holy cow, that guy is *tall*!" tall).  All other factors equal, women *tend* to prefer tall guys, which means more women will be interested, which means there's a greater chance of finding someone you like. Just like it's easier if you're in shape vs morbidly obese, just like it's easier if you have smooth skin vs serious acne, just like dating is easier if you have good income vs working minimum wage.
TheRealHooks	I always loved the power trips the music director would go on with the contemporary band. She looked down on us *hard*. Our bass player, for instance, used to be Chuck Berry's bass player, later played with the Commodores, and after that led his own band that was getting ~$4-5k a night. The music director, on the other hand, had never led a band. Choir =/= band.   So we'd point out something that should be changed in an arrangement, and she'd say stuff like, "Well, I have a degree in *music*, so we'really doing it my way". She had no idea how to run a band.
TheRealHooks	Maybe they can see down your blouse when you're sitting...
TheRealHooks	Not as big of a difference, but my wife is your height and I'm 6'1", and she's remarked several times over the years how she loves how she has to lean up to kiss me, unlike her previous bfs.
TheRealHooks	Yep, totally different muscles.  Of course biceps are important, but curls pretty much ignore the subscapularis, which is the main muscle that rotates the humerus for an arm wrestle, and gym guys don't do a lot of forearm specific exercises, especially not for pronation (pronator teres and pronator quadratus).  So with a little technique and training of the right muscles, you can beat big guys.
TheRealHooks	You wrote me a book passing off your big ego onto other people.
TheRealHooks	Beating someone much bigger and stronger than you in an arm wrestle.  That's right, *Lee*, go do some more CrossFit!!!  (Lee is my hypercompetitive cousin who's much stronger than me)
TheRealHooks	So organ is tough...so what?  Show up, rehearse, do your part, go home.
TheRealHooks	The eye of hurricane Ivan hit my town in 2004, and we are right on the water.  Some houses didn't get flooded -- they were just gone, picked up and carried to sea or elsewhere.  Other houses were completely flooded, and like you said, there was *so much* work.   Luckily our house was pretty much intact, but our neighbor's roof was in our yard, along with enough of other people's things, tree branches, trash, trampolines, etc, to make the neighborhood unrecognizable.  When this shit happens, you don't miss the electricity.  You miss the running water.  No electricity is annoying.  No water puts you in survival mode.  Through all of it though, it was some of the happiest times I've ever had because I got to spend my days outside, interacted with people face-to-face a lot more, got a real sense of community, and all that yard work on my and other people's houses put me in the best shape I was ever in.
TheRealHooks	The thumbnail for this post looks like a person water skiing.
TheRealHooks	I can imagine the feeling just fine.  I just can't imagine that being my response to something that is objectively so minor.
TheRealHooks	This is one I just can't understand, try as I might.  I've never had a panic attack or anything close to it.  The worst I've ever had is that sinking feeling in your stomach before you get in a fight.  I just have trouble wrapping my head around something so irrational.  Especially since people who have panic attacks *know* it's irrational.  Thinking you're going to die as a result of a phone call you don't want to make...I just can't understand it.  I sympathize, but I can't understand it.
TheRealHooks	'Tired' belongs in a totally separated category from 'fatigued' or 'exhausted'.  Being tired is an annoyance.  Being genuinely fatigued or exhausted ruins your ability to function.
TheRealHooks	Height is just one of the many factors that make a person attractive or not, obviously it's not a deal breaker for most people.  You're also pretty much exactly average height for most of the western world, so your height shouldn't be an issue.  
TheRealHooks	I've never understood that.  I've been playing in church bands for years, and we just show up, play, and head out.  The music director though, Jesus H Cristi, the attitude...
TheRealHooks	Playing in the rain with my dog.  It was raining pretty heavily a few weeks ago here, and I just decided to go play in the rain.  My dog and I went out, ran around, I danced, I made weird noises at my dog, and we splashed around in puddles.  When we were done, I got us both to the front door, and we shook off all the water we could before going back inside.    It was pure bliss.
TheRealHooks	Doesn't matter.  It belongs down the drain or in the garbage.
TheRealHooks	I'm not sure if I'd love or hate that...
TheRealHooks	I guess I'm the only fan of modern pop here lol.  Katie Perry - One of the Boys
TheRealHooks	That sucks.  I've been there.  Luckily I *was* able to accept the "Whatever, she's a bitch" attitude and move on rather quickly.  What hurts much more is when someone cheats on you despite still loving you and wanting you to stay, and they genuinely want the relationship to work, but they just have a problem.  They still treat you sweetly, tell you they love you and they mean it, still brag about how wonderful you are to their friends, still have those stars in their eyes when they look at you...yet they cheat.  They have some sort of disconnect in their brain where they can still love you completely but have something on the side.
TheRealHooks	Never broke a rib, but after hernia surgery, that's how I felt.  
TheRealHooks	I dated a girl once who had chronic migraines, as in, a perpetual migraine.  She just dealt with it until I finally found her a doctor who could figure it out.  When he fixed her migraine issue, she was walking on sunshine.  It's been about 7 years since then, and she's had no migraines.  That's the *one* good thing that came out of her dating me lol.
TheRealHooks	My father-in-law *just* started having memory problems a few months ago.  This was right when my wife (fiancee at the time) and I were planning the wedding.  We hammered it into him every day for months, and he still couldn't remember the date of the wedding.  Just a year ago, he never had any memory issues.  It's happening *fast*, and it scares the hell out of me.  My wife is a trooper though.
TheRealHooks	You're right.  31 less by fewer.
TheRealHooks	My schizophrenic next door neighbor makes up a large portion of this statistic.  She spends most of the day just standing on the front porch smoking.
TheRealHooks	There's a man who works at the Burger King a few miles from my house, and his voice sounds like he'd be James Earl Jones' bigger brother.   I don't like Burger King, but I literally go there just to hear him talk.  "Sir, can I take your order?"  Why yes, yes I will join the Dark Side.
TheRealHooks	2000 total federal revenue: $2.03 trillion  2007 total federal revenue: $2.57 trillion  There wasn't a revenue problem that caused the Great Recession.   Real GDP 2000: $12.68 trillion  Real GDP 2007: $14.99 trillion  Also not a growth problem.  The Great Recession was caused neither by tax cuts nor growth problems.  Go take a few more courses in economics.
TheRealHooks	I wonder if most of the people doing this in this thread know the difference but just want to share something somewhat related that people might enjoy, or if they're just mixing up "hoax" with "conspiracy theory".  People are just answering the question, "What's proven to be bullshit that some people still believe?"  That's a question that's more open and has more fun answers.
TheRealHooks	He is trying really hard to plant the seed that you and his gf should hook up or all three of you should hook up.  Rookie tactics.
TheRealHooks	While I agree, that's just not the way Reddit threads work.  We constantly get stuff like, "People of X profession..." and the responses are mostly, "Well, I'm not of profession X, but..." and stuff like that.  We don't answer the exact question.  We answer the spirit of the question.

TheRealHooks	I'm very familiar with you, Ramses.  I've asked you a few grammar questions over the last few months that you've been kind enough to answer for me.  It seems we're in total agreement about the kinds of responses that *should* be in this thread, but we disagree whether we should just let it go or not, which is fine.

TheRealHooks	This seems to be true.  Anyone who actually takes into account reasonable factors finds there's somewhere between 5% and 0%, and unfortunately it's hard to tell exactly what factors should be included since it's so complex, and how much each factor should count.  Two factors I'd be interested to see taken into account and quantified if possible, would be height and voice characteristics.  This is most subjective, but most bosses I've had (both men and women) are above average height for their sex and have lower voices than average for their sex.  It makes some sense to think people would naturally tend to want to listen to and follow people who are physically bigger and with lower voices, but I don't know how much evidence there is for that.
TheRealHooks	That's not how the line goes...
TheRealHooks	> SomeBODY...  ftfy
TheRealHooks	> because I don't tell people false information, even if they believe it  Thank you!
TheRealHooks	If true, that's pretty interesting.
TheRealHooks	I had no idea.  How do I actually create the multiple desktops?
TheRealHooks	Because [this](https://i.makeagif.com/media/8-01-2015/FKCPFq.gif) is the peeing technique I've chosen.  Gots ta have muh space.
TheRealHooks	Let's get one thing straight.  People in all categories are manipulative and shitty.  Gay, straight, white, black, brown, Democrat, Republican, Lakers fans, soccer fans, pick up truck drivers, priests, SJWs, meninists (sp?), plumbers, prostitutes, ventriloquists, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, left-handed people, dancers, astronauts, salesmen, fry cooks, gamers, people whose favorite color is blue...and so on.

TheRealHooks	I don't get the joke...  And I don't see how it's an inherently male thought.  There are plenty of both men and women who like threesomes in all their various forms, and both men and women can be pretty manipulative and shitty to their partners.
TheRealHooks	Trying to walk off broken bones hasn't proved to be a successful tactic yet.  When I was a kid I broke my tibia, and I tried to walk it off.  Unsuccessful.  Wicked cool cast though :D
TheRealHooks	I'm not talking about just average joes who ask to buy my wife a drink because they don't know she's married or something.  I'm talking mostly about the foreign guys who stalk her social media, then immediately start in her DMs with really crude, inappropriate stuff like, "Show me ur pussy" as the first message.  Or worse, they just send a dick pick and *then* get crude and pushy.  If a normal dude talks to my wife respectfully and asks her out or to dance or to buy her a drink, she just politely declines and lets them know she's married but still appreciates the compliment.
TheRealHooks	Being an NFL running back.    It turns out if you don't have quickness, breakaway speed, or strength, you're probably not going to be a very good running back.  10 year olds aren't very rational though, but I had changed dreams by 13.
TheRealHooks	Super late, but:  *Day of the Tentacle*   It was one of those cartoony storybook kind of PC games back in the day that was hilarious and witty.  It was an all-around good time, and I'm really sad that my disc is too scratched up to work anymore.
TheRealHooks	Gay people don't have threesomes?
TheRealHooks	I drive a very loud vehicle right now.  The muffler on my old truck literally fell off, and I'm just saving up to get a new one.  Every time I fire it up, I feel like a Canadian on the road, constantly apologizing to everyone.  I'm **sorry** I'm making so much noise.  I hate it, and it'll be fixed soon!
TheRealHooks	I like it when my wife flirts with other guys...and when I say flirt, I mean curb their advances with the full three stooges idiot runaround to waste their time and entertain us, often asking me what we should say next.  And when they ask for nudes, they definitely get nudes, but they're from the Google search "ugliest boobs on earth" or "diseased vagina".    She's awesome :)
TheRealHooks	Fellow southerner.  I forget I have an accent until I'm somewhere up north.  And yes, it gets worse when I'm drunk.

TheRealHooks	Having sex with college girls isn't in itself creepy.  Referring to them as fresh meat is *very* creepy.  
TheRealHooks	I could never live in a house with birds...or a bird killer.
TheRealHooks	Does mumbling count?  I hate it, and I'm actively trying to fix it.
TheRealHooks	This annoys me.  Every day, my dad cleans his ears out with Q-tips.  Every. Day.  He's never had any ear issues.  Every day, my wife cleans her ears out with Q-tips.  She has *never* had any ear issues.  Meanwhile, I keep listening to doctors and never stick anything in my ears, and I keep getting blockages, infections, cholestiatomas, and more.  wtf
TheRealHooks	I don't think there's a rise of anti-intellectualism or anti-science.  I just think there's a rise in how much attention people are paying to it.  Kinda like how violent crimes are down almost 50% since 1992, yet coverage of said crimes is up by several hundred percent.    It just *seeeeems* like a bigger problem, but it actually isn't a bigger problem at all, likely less of a problem than before.
TheRealHooks	sorry :/
TheRealHooks	Freshmen =/= fresh meat  Freshman denotes a year in school, fresh meat implies they're prey.  One is just a fact, the other is a shitty way to view women.
TheRealHooks	If she calls me "daddy" or anything remotely similar.  It's creepy and gross. 
TheRealHooks	Copied from another reply to someone saying that:  I'm not talking about just average joes who ask to buy my wife a drink because they don't know she's married or something. I'm talking mostly about the foreign guys who stalk her social media, then immediately start in her DMs with really crude, inappropriate stuff like, "Show me ur pussy" as the first message. Or worse, they just send a dick pick and then get crude and pushy. If a normal dude talks to my wife respectfully and asks her out or to dance or to buy her a drink, she just politely declines and lets them know she's married but still appreciates the compliment.
TheRealHooks	Who are you?  Me?
TheRealHooks	And do I have lots of pins from each machine or just one pin from each, totaling 10 pins?
TheRealHooks	One of the machines is the wrong weight, or the pins it creates are the wrong weight?
TheRealHooks	And this illustrates perfectly that every woman experiences periods differently.  I see women in here saying that it has nothing to do with her mood, then other women saying it definitely affects her mood, and everywhere in between.  My wife's mood is definitely affected by her period.  For her, her moods are just a little more pronounced than usual.  Things that normally bring her up bring her up a little more, and things that bring her down bring her down a little more.
TheRealHooks	What is this question about?
TheRealHooks	I'm glad I'm married because if this is the kind of shit that passes as having game these days, we're all doomed.
TheRealHooks	Leave these poor girls with daddy issues alone.  They don't know any better.
TheRealHooks	My goodness, you're such a tool.  Do you call them fresh meat to their faces?
TheRealHooks	You *are* the dipshit.  Me pointing out that you're an idiot on one extreme doesn't mean I'm suggesting you flip to another extreme.  There is a healthy medium, and it's where normal people with social skills hang out.  What's wrong with calling them women or girls?  You don't have to talk like some weird predatory twat who has a dingy cellar to tie girls up in, and you don't have to talk like a white knight.  You can just talk like a normal fucking human being, and call women women.
TheRealHooks	Calling a boyfriend "daddy".  It's disgusting.
yeahsowha	Who has a voice so annoying you can't stand to listen to? | 
yeahsowha	where's Dwight's cousin? 
yeahsowha	don't. just think. sometimes that's all we ever have to do before we act on impulse. just think, bud. 
yeahsowha	maybe I don't know what a scone is supposed to look like but I see biscuits. still,  look yummy and delectable.
yeahsowha	not one but two? hmmm, I'd utilize my arm rest for sure. it's only fair.  also, thought she was Tastee by the thumbnail.  she would've never let that slide. nuh huh. 
yeahsowha	its unortunate that we have to look at businesses being protected by the same Constitution as people. 
yeahsowha	near death experience. 
yeahsowha	being on a public bus and watching everyone take their sweet time. whether it be swiping/paying for fare or slowly getting off at their stop.  it really tests my patience. like, there are others who may need to be some where faster than you do.
yeahsowha	ouch. potential MRSA. go to ER ASAP
yeahsowha	she's a babe.
yeahsowha	using words like 'allegedly' and 'may have' just to cover our politically correct ass. smh
yeahsowha	feels. damn you for the feels. 
yeahsowha	I concur. 
yeahsowha	looks good. but um, where's the cheese? can't have chick parm without some mozz/parm cheese.    heathen 
yeahsowha	I'd double wrap it with a tortilla and prepare for the best mess made west of the Mississippi. 
yeahsowha	oh my,  blast from the frkn past man. I've actually seen some for sale recently. could be the really old ones though. with all the new shit they've been coming out with, they should bring 'em back. 
yeahsowha	asked in my first reply, glad it wasn't anything hugely wrong. glad you're okay though.
yeahsowha	if you don't mind some stranger asking, what's up? you okay now?
yeahsowha	laid on side to prevent choking on vomit, better breathing. arm out and head laid on said biceps. difficult to describe but def. effective. Google some pics.
yeahsowha	same happened to my ex. felt bad since her first time was with me and we had the most diesel of herb. cuddled it out and relaxed.  pro tip, start beginners with low grade/Reg smoke. shit, some older, vet. smokers prefer that shit over the loud.
yeahsowha	I think you'd know if you broke a rib due to the extreme pain .  probably just a sprain. interesting that you consider 150-200 twice a day a small dose. that's pretty high, especially if you don't use. 
yeahsowha	shit, a while back there were reports in the UK that their bud have been laced with powdered glass to make it look like it was all kiefy. that i do believe. fact. also, heard and seen some mixing their bud (lowgrade) with spice/k2 and selling it. dangerous.  i guess it's def. possible but opiates and other more expensive substances, like coke, highly doubtful. 
yeahsowha	agreed. 
yeahsowha	Imodium makes you constipated, champ.  but yeah, screw em!
yeahsowha	is it just me or the video seems sped up?
yeahsowha	work it girl. this girl has moxie. WORK IT.
yeahsowha	  ^^^
yeahsowha	i hate to agree with you but you're kinda right. maybe different writers of something. 
yeahsowha	i read a few books from the ending to the beginning. call me whatever. it was a cool experience. wouldn't do it to any story though. 
yeahsowha	Diablo. def.
yeahsowha	found the sun pun ladies and gents. as you were my sun pun enthusiast.
yeahsowha	no harm, no foul. 
yeahsowha	That can't really be capable on an actual stock car sold by the dealer, right? forgive if that's a stupid question. just curious. 
yeahsowha	dont have much to contribute to your post but personally, too much is being texted. gotta watch out for shit like that. not trying to tell you what to do but have conversations like that in person or an actual phone call.  really? you have him as 'd-boy'?  lol c'mon man.
yeahsowha	gotcha.  meant the whole convo in general though, namean? but yeah, koo.   on to the next one bud. 
yeahsowha	convince the taxpayers to cough it up. bad enough people are bitching about the narcans. would be nice though.

yeahsowha	Lol it's amazing how people over analyze comments like yours. Such a shame that's it warrants an explanation lol. Def go through the same shit with my mamas. Mom would hurt me also if I yelled at her lol.
yeahsowha	Well, that's alarming.
yeahsowha	This damn movie is so good.
yeahsowha	Angels are neat af. If you really look into the research of their hierarchy and different forms it gets very interesting. Some angels, I believe the seraphims, (idk but the ones closer to God) have like 14 wings, some have to cover their eyes from the might of God. Awesome stuff. You made me want to dive back into looking up angel stuff lol. 
yeahsowha	Great insight. This thought used to bother me a lot. But I believe that since Satan and all the angels were God's creation, he allowed and instilled in them the capability and concept of thought and doubt. By allowing  his creations to think and form opinions of their own, he gives them a choice, free will if it were: To believe in Him and have faith in His plan as God, (which is difficult to understand and accept without question), or decide for yourself and do what/as YOU please. It goes for humans as well. Awesome thinking that had rocked my faith since I had one.
yeahsowha	i.e Elvis

yeahsowha	Interesting. I've watched many episodes of Anthony Bourdain's show where he does this with the locals. Always thought it was weird, but he probably does it unintentionally.
yeahsowha	Woah. Can someone ELI5 what he did and if it's harmful? Common? Any examples of what the *actual* desired results look like?
yeahsowha	Saw the trailer, but what's the movie about? Winter fighting?

yeahsowha	Looks like Mr. Noodle from Seasame Street.

yeahsowha	Same with the stereotypical snooty accent that the US upper class has. Or the dialect of the Western/Southern lower class.  Dialects are neat.

Scottstimo	Third device's the charm? | Rough timeline-  * November 2015 - Original 5X purchased from Google, 32GB Ice. * November 2016 - Original phone completely bricks while using Google Maps in Android Auto app (phone didn't respond to anything, totally dead). Filed a Nexus Protect claim and received 32GB Carbon. * Today - phone bricks and enters bootloop while using the Google Maps preview app. Can enter bootloader (but didn't enable OEM Unlock so I can't do anything/unlock bootloader etc), bootloops otherwise. Nexus Protect did not transfer to my new IMEI so after a series of support calls Google support offers to send me a replacement device, without having to file a Nexus Protect claim.

Scottstimo	attaboy
Karmastocracy	It's been less than a week since launch and I have 20+ in my inventory and haven't spent a single cent on microtransactions and never will. Just play the game, and every time you level up you get a bright engram which often has 250 bright dust (5 medallions worth). 
Karmastocracy	The Reapers won't stop at Earth. They'll destroy every organic being in the galaxy if we don't find a way to stop them. Each of us needs to be willing to die to save humanity. Anything less...and they've already won!
Karmastocracy	Oh boy. I will fully respond when I wake up in the morning, but for my own sanity I'll repeat myself.   I own the game, and I can personally attest to the fact that **there are zero pay to win aspects of Destiny 2, and all microtransactions are purely cosmetic**.   Those items you listed are part of a common package you recieve each time you level up, and after only 12hrs of play I have more shaders, mods, and sparrows than i could use in the next few months of playing. You also get a sparrow and enough mods to equip all three of your characters after beating the campaign. The packages you can pay real money for are used to get extra shaders, which you can use to decorate your gear but are purely cosmetic.   I paid $80 for the game plus both expansions, and I will get probably a thousand hours worth of entertainment and content before the year's end. That's value for money, and a shitload better than buying literally any F2P bullshit currently out right now.   I grieve for the games industry when a game like Destiny does it right, while it is other games compromise their economy with pay to win ideals and gamers eat it up. Pay to win titles are the current cancer of the games industry and I refuse to buy any game which has even the slightest free to play/pay to win elements. Destiny 2 does not have these elements, and point of fact is the best FPS experience I've bad in several years.  Edit: Holy shit... I just watched that video and read that thread. It's actually shocking how everyone's circlejerking over incorrect information without playing the game or seeing how any of it works. What a shitshow, this is honestly disgusting. 
Karmastocracy	I'd like to clarify that there's absolutely no pay to win mechanics in destiny. Everything buyable is purely cosmetic. 
Karmastocracy	His statement is simple and logical, and your reply is absolute lunacy. I grieve for your sanity if you can not understand these simple concepts.  The word is not black and white as you percieve it; the world is shades of grey... and this decision could indeed be the lesser of two evils. 
Karmastocracy	Look, I respect the hell out of the WF devs and think their business model is very ethical, my criticism with the game is with the in-game economy not their business model. They do F2P better than almost any other game out there, and it's honestly the gold-standard as far as any F2P economy goes... but it's still a compromised system and I vastly prefer non-F2P titles. It has MMO level grinding which can be bypassed simply with real world money. Like it or hate it, anything hard to get in Destiny you have to grind in-game for... there's simply no other way.  All that being said I think WF does F2P well and I understand why some people would prefer that model, I just really dislike it.
Karmastocracy	I was with you up until the comment about Warframe, since even though that game can be a blast I'd rather pay full price than have microtransactions affect the base-structure of a game's economy. I actually feel Destiny does it right, cosmetic **only**. 
Karmastocracy	This is false information as Dr Disrespect is techically a parody artist and what he does is protected by parody law.  Also in the real world most people can tell his persona is an act and that was a joke. 
Karmastocracy	Damn, great clutch dude! 
Karmastocracy	Not even close, this is amazing guardian!

Karmastocracy	Well it's either a unique take on Sabine, or it's supposed to be a drawing BY Sabine since it certainly appears to match her artistic style.

Karmastocracy	eh, I jumped up from my couch doing some fist pumps and I was watching the episode home alone...
Karmastocracy	Lots of good comments in this thread, but I'd also like to add that digital is quieter than physical since the disk tray doesn't need to be active while playing the game. 
Karmastocracy	Republicans aren't Nazis, but they sure have been defending an awful lot of actual Nazis lately. 
Karmastocracy	Denver, CO here and I'm having the same issue. I'm a sysadmin and I've tried multiple devices and two different networks, so I believe a node has gone down somewhere!
Karmastocracy	No, I would highly recommend watching a cut-scene compilation of the first Witcher game as it doesn't hold up to it's successors. That being said, I do know people who enjoyed playing through the first game immensely, despite it being somewhat dated, so definitely do what you think is best.  However, I would recommend playing through The Witcher 2 before Witcher 3 because while it's not quite as good, it does hold up from both a graphical and gameplay perspective!
Karmastocracy	That was amazing!
Karmastocracy	Whoa, feels like I'm back on High Impact Halo! Amazing job :)
Karmastocracy	> and he had a **very interesting life**. I won't go any more than that, because you're Boy Scouts so **I'm not going to tell you what he did.**  > (CROWD CHANTING)  > Should I tell you? Should I tell you?  > (APPLAUSE)  > You're Boy Scouts, but you know life. You know life.  Interesting is the adjective his original sentence, and the interesting things which this man did on a yacht were   too inappropriate to tell kids about. If this were a word problem I'd ask you, what sort of interesting adult activities do men with money do on yachts?
Karmastocracy	If this is the quote he most identifies with... he probably is!
Karmastocracy	As your guardian begins to plummet off the ruined tower he/she reaches out their hands and grabs their ghost while falling. At the same moment the traveler magically breaks free of the shackles, ghost awakens, and your ship's autopilot catches both of you on the way down. Ghaul dies of a heart-attack, the entire red legion dies of a mysterious plague, and you immediately head to Nessus to begin the strike.  After the Inverted Spire strike, credits roll. FIN  /s 
Karmastocracy	Excellent post, thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences!
Karmastocracy	This man understands

Karmastocracy	This is my favorite show on television and I try to do everything I can to spread the word and get my friends watching. I desperately hope it gets a fourth season!!!
Karmastocracy	Those are great stories :)
Karmastocracy	Take your filthy upvote and get out of here! 
Karmastocracy	/u/Bovronius is correct, while it was privately funded other religious institutions were denied when they tried to exercise the same right.   I'm not going to sit here and rant but from the outside looking in this does appear to be a pretty clear example of corruption between the separation of church and state. 
Karmastocracy	It's mentioned in the very first paragraph of the article
Karmastocracy	That's the current Trials hand cannon, it's not terrible for pve
Karmastocracy	Yes... my last missing calcified fragment, thank you!
Karmastocracy	I tested it last week but I have no runes at the moment, I'd really appreciate the info too.
Karmastocracy	Come on now, we can argue policy back and forth but Trump is an open racist, that's no secret. 
Karmastocracy	The Tier 3 boss this week is Balwur
Karmastocracy	Spoken like someone who doesn't understand specs and is being swayed by marketing. The OneX's CPU is composed of eight custom x86 cores clocked at 2.3GHz apiece, which is significantly more powerful than any other console on the market. The GPU is 40 customized compute units at 1172MHz, which again makes it substantially better than the PS4 Pro.   There are games which run at 1080p 60fps on Xbones right now, and you can look at Anthem as a first gen launch title for OneX as the starting line as far as performance can go. Destiny's my favorite game of all time, but the fact is Destiny was created from the ground up as a 30fps game and the engine most likely isn't optimized to run well at a higher frame rate.
Karmastocracy	I love r/iamverysmart but this does not apply, this is elementary school level religious studies. 
Karmastocracy	If he's talking about Trump he's dead on though. 
Karmastocracy	Looks like things are becoming quite steamy in here...
Karmastocracy	Have you tried Destiny? With Destiny 2 right around the corner it might be the perfect time to get familiar with the mechanics and game world, and it's one of the most exceptionally addicting FPS games ever built.
Karmastocracy	That Warlock became legend!
Karmastocracy	I've always loved that song!
Karmastocracy	That was awesome!!!
Karmastocracy	That's metagaming!
Karmastocracy	CNN is ubsurdly biased and it was never more evident than during the Democratic Primary when they refused to cover Bernie and pushed Hillary beyond belief. That's when they lost me and my social circle at least. 
Karmastocracy	Sure, that seems obvious to me... I don't think anyone is arguing the opposite.
Karmastocracy	*While he's in the middle of a highly unusual and significant investigation of the sitting president and his cabinet
Karmastocracy	I can definitely relate to that, I used to be part of an active clan near the beginning of Destiny but it's become increasingly inactive. Meanwhile I'm still trying to run the Challenge mode raid every week on all three of my characters and I'm struggling to find people who are reliably playing each week without relying on the crapshoot of LFG.  I've run all versions of all the raids and know the mechanics inside and out, but I can only play after 6PM MST on weekdays (although I play an excessive amount on the weekends). Let me know if that fits your schedules, I'd love to be a regular raid buddy.  GT: Haxx
Karmastocracy	Bernie suggested Comey step-down months ago, not be fired the day before he was set to testify in front of congress in the middle of an active investigation.
Karmastocracy	Comey should have voluntarily stepped down, but being fired by the acting President in the middle of an investigation on that same President a day before he's set to talk to congress about the investigation? Come on now, there's a pretty huge difference.
Karmastocracy	I think you're onto something!
Karmastocracy	Sure, I read articles from all three of those agencies but I don't trust any of them at all, and I only read news from each one because they're all so biased you need to read news from multiple sources now.  Look, you seem extremely reasonable compared to a lot of people here... and if you say that's what you see in the video then I believe you, but I just can't see it myself. What I see is a man who's whip smart turning a moment of surprise into a joke and all the reporters just eating it up and spitting out articles exaggerating the point to make everyone look good.  I don't think we'll ever know who's actually right, but I do know that having a healthy level of skepticism is important to figuring out the truth, and his initial reaction does make a damn funny gif.
Karmastocracy	Honest question, do you genuinely not see the difference?
Karmastocracy	Haha what the hell, that was amazing
Karmastocracy	I'm serious about trying to get down to the nitty gritty of why you feel this way as don't see it, but I'd like to figure out if you're not seeing the full picture or if I'm not seeing the full picture. In what way do you see this as hypocritical?
Karmastocracy	...but just watch the video?  I mean there's literally video evidence of what we're discussing, I don't understand how you can reference an article (of course the media & career politicians are going to try to spin it!) when you can just view the footage yourself and see the 1-2 seconds of genuine surprise.  Also for the record I do have more experience at reading body language and expressions than most, but what I said was "you don't have to be an expert"... YOU'RE the one asserting that there's an opposite meaning to his words that you can pick up via body language, but I was just confirming that his body language does indeed support his words.
Karmastocracy	Check out the video itself: https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/862290219067899905/video/1  You don't have to be a master in micro expressions or body language to recognize surprise before it's quickly covered up.
Karmastocracy	Let me ask you a question my man, could you please read the context above and please tell me if anything you wrote implies more than one usage of Kratom?  If you don't think Kratom's effective, then why have you used it more than 35 times? Also, if you're familiar with Kratom's actual effects then why did you post about the one time it didn't affect you... it doesn't seem relevant to the conversation given your experience.  As an addendum, I'd recommend not making Kratom tea as it's a rather ineffective method and tends to be quite wasteful vs toss 'n wash or making capsules.
Karmastocracy	So you've only tried Kratom once or twice but didn't do enough to get decent buzz and believe you are qualified to give advice about the drug? That's like someone microdosing LSD then telling people it's a shitty drug because it didn't give you visuals.

Karmastocracy	Dude's always had a brilliant mind for design, that's what made him such a good reviewer and an even better developer!
Karmastocracy	I've loved him since 1UP Yours and I still love him today. He's the biggest Bungie FPS fan in the world so it's absolutely incredible to see him designing these iconic raid encounters and leading the charge on Destiny 2 design.
Karmastocracy	What song is that?
Karmastocracy	You don't deserve to have a Gaming PC if you lack a basic understanding of  hardware
Karmastocracy	Consoles & PCs are built from the same components hardware wise they just run different software. So while high end gaming PCs are more powerful than any current generation console, the scorpio devkit is more powerful than most current consumer home gaming PCs.  So not only can a console be beefy compared to a PC, but the console devkit shown off in this thread is beefier than most PCs. In a year or two from now the scales will probably start tipping aggressively back towards most consumer gaming PCs being more powerful than the Scorpio but for now your original assessment just seems pretty off-base. 
Karmastocracy	Dashcam footage recording constantly while driving
Karmastocracy	There's nothing edgy about being part of the majority, that's a misuse of the term.
Karmastocracy	I'm honestly confused by your statement, are you saying it's not normal for one partner to be the submissive one in a relationship? I feel like this is whitewashing human behavior as that is very normal in both gay & straight relationships. Being sexually submissive can be part of a normal relationship and often times the dom & sub will actually switch places given time.  I feel like your outrage comes from a good place, but is based on a very traditional set of values which unfairly radicalizes the LGBT community and doesn't treat them like normal human beings.
Karmastocracy	I don't even like Colbert but it's pretty damn funny that's all it took to trigger The_Cucks. Queen Trump's a massive pussy though so I guess we shouldn't be *that* surprised.
Karmastocracy	Trump is bossed around by our corporate overlords and sponsored by Russia, so that doesn't really change the situation.

Karmastocracy	Whatchu up to? | 
Karmastocracy	I've Made a Huge Mistake | 
Karmastocracy	Every comment you've posted in this thread to be precise. Let's go through a quick list.  > The couple will receive joint custody and Kelly Jones, the ex-wife of the InfoWars host, will have the right to decide who the children live with.  [\[via TheDailyBeast\]](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/27/infowars-alex-jones-loses-custody-case-ex-wife-wins-right-to-decide-where-children-live.html)  - Your original reply listed above makes a minor distinction of joint custody being an even 50/50 split between the parents, while user /u/Ihavefourspades pointed out the nuances created by that decision. Whether or not /u/Ihavefourspades is a child of divorce or just more familiar with divorce proceedings, he's correct in that the ruling will mean the children will practically spend the majority of their time living with their mother and the real split will probably look more like 70-30 than 50-50. There's a whole host of reasons this happens, but it's common for the family member the kids are actively living with to get the lion's share of time with them.   - Next, every comment since this original argument has been trying to defend your incomplete point of view and you've gone so far as to accuse every critic of being an alt account of a single user. Even a cursory examination of the user accounts which have replied to you in this thread reveal irregular interests, unique browsing habits, probable time-zone differences, and a complete lack of comment chain connections. You don't have to be an expert to draw a reasonable conclusion here, but your ego is impeding your deduction skills.   - Finally, calling someone a "coward" for creating new accounts or deliberately obfuscating their comment history is ignoring how valuable it is to retain some anonymity on the web. 
Karmastocracy	Damn, you're hot as hell!
Karmastocracy	I also disagree with you, for the record. 
Karmastocracy	No, not an assumption. It's an educated guess based on statistical probability, my own experience as the son of divorced parents, and a father who own a law firm with extensive experience dealing with divorce cases.  Whether you like it or not your comment history does reveal details about yourself and how you engage others.  Choosing not to fully understand the risks associated with breaches of privacy or internet security does not make you immune to such issues, but only serves to highlight your incomplete knowledge of the platform.  And come now, a few paragraphs surely only counts as a short story.
Karmastocracy	As humans we base all of our decisions on educated guesses and assumptions, the only difference being what degree of certainty we are about the probability of those assumptions.    I'm not going to teach you how to infer information about someone based on what they share about themselves or how they engage with the world. However later, when I have more time, I will breakdown the reasons why the kids are likely to spend the majority of their time with the parent they live with rather than a busy disgraced celebrity parent they don't live with.

Karmastocracy	You're right of course. I prefer to run simulated zombie survival scenarios based on more realistic media, such as the classic Shaun of the Dead.
Karmastocracy	This is perfect
Karmastocracy	Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.
Karmastocracy	Nice, thanks for the footage stephenrg95. I unfortunately wasn't present for this game but it was an interesting watch for sure!
Karmastocracy	All of these stories are amazing
Karmastocracy	I only know one truth...
Karmastocracy	All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspended animation so that their trip seems really short, right? I think I figured out how to do it.  Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when the Destiny 2 gameplay reveal comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me. It's simple science, Cozmo.
Karmastocracy	As a US citizen... seems pretty damn accurate to me
Karmastocracy	Alright, that's a fair point.
Karmastocracy	I definitely disagree, Shotguns take far less skill and the skill gap is virtually non-existent. You don't even need to aim for the head with shotguns.
Karmastocracy	Thanks dude, you're an unsung hero <3
Karmastocracy	I agree with you but calm down dude lol
Karmastocracy	You're an accused rapist, I really don't care what you have to say. 
Kinrest	Why do you need to turn the USB over *at least* three times before it fits?
Kinrest	[NSFW] What is one sexual taboo you always wanted to try? | 
Kinrest	To the dog owner: Socialize the dog as often as you can. Especially with kids. This makes them more friendly to strangers and helps with general training.   To the cat owner: Trade it in for a dog. 
Kinrest	What a prude. 
Kinrest	Maybe show her pictures of nails when they're neglected. Look for th especially nasty ones. Another method could be for each nail clipped she gets a bite of her favorite treat. 
Kinrest	Use a scale. 
Kinrest	The time this post has been up is constantly increasing. So as long as it remains, IMMORTALITY!!
Kinrest	Oh shit! Hahaha. Never mind. 
Kinrest	I'm enjoying that view as well. 
Kinrest	The future holds the future. 
Kinrest	I tried to post there. Too many rules prevented it from posting no matter how I worded it. 
Kinrest	D&D slave prices? | Assuming a human male slave used for labor would cost an average 100gp, how much might the price increase or decrease for other races and/or classes? 
Kinrest	Makes sense to me. 
Kinrest	Same reason anyone has flags. 
Kinrest	How would we know?
Kinrest	Damn. Sorry to hear that. Cut her out of your life. No contact with her but keep in contact with any of her family. Casually bring up that fact she not only cheated on you but got knocked up in the process. Give her reputation and good rocking. 
Kinrest	When my powers end, will all the plush I've caused revert to it's original state?
Kinrest	I've never heard anyone call their grandmother 'meemaw', white or otherwise. But I would assume most of it is from watching the Big Bang Theory. A sitcom where one of the characters (white guy) calls his grandmother 'meemaw'. 
Kinrest	I'm a guy. She's one of those hardcore, anti-male feminists. It's kinda funny. 
Kinrest	Courtesy clerk in a market, front desk clerk or house keeping in a hotel, or cashier of a fast food joint. No one really pays much attention to you, but you're still 'socializing'. It's like trying the kiddie pool before going in the deep end of the main pool. 
Kinrest	I live across from a church and I swear every time a raven is perched on the cross of the chapel something crappy happens to me. Car breaks down, get fired, get in a fight (I didn't start it), etc. 
Kinrest	Probably not. But our pupils are actually holes. 
Kinrest	It's the texture for me. Feels like I'm eating slug slime. 
Kinrest	Marriage between 3rd cousin is legal in all the US. 2nd cousin in most southern states and a handful of northern. 
Kinrest	I can settle for 25M, but I've always wanted to live in Alaska. I'd flip a coin. 
Kinrest	I suppose it depends on the situation. Either get even, or get successful.   What's your situation? Assuming you have one. 
Kinrest	IT feeds off fear. Doom Guy has literally been to Hell and back several times. I don't think Pennywise has any material to work with. It's why he targets children as they're easier to scare.

Kinrest	Depends on the location. 
Kinrest	A very nice towel. I think I see something else far more beautiful, though.

Kinrest	What do I need to know when moving to the Oregon Coast? | I'm a Californian trying to move up to Oregon. I've lived on the coast for so long I'd like to live in a similar area. Budget's not much of an issue but I'd like to keep it reasonable. What are some things I should know to make the move even a bit easier? Any info can help. 
Kinrest	Diced grilled chicken. 
Kinrest	An answer. 
Kinrest	Dish soap. Could be worse. 
Kinrest	What's a reasonable rent in Oregon? | [removed]
Kinrest	What are some good and bad things about living in Oregon? | 
Kinrest	Either something horrible (death, cheating, small dick, etc.) or something amazing (child, immortality, Half Life 3, etc.)
Kinrest	If you were to read the details you'd get the context. 
Kinrest	I can stop a speeding bullet. Once. 
Kinrest	I was browsing Craigslist's 'casual encounters' section for shits and giggles and saw my friend's mother on there looking for a one night stand with a 'young stud'. She's married. 
Kinrest	Beetle
Kinrest	It sounds like you already knew the answer when you asked the DM. If you're playing RAW then taking advantage of the DM's ignorance is a dick move. Otherwise it's up to him as long as he has all the information.   Also, monk weapons are any simple weapon lacking the two-handed and/or heavy property. The shortsword is also considered a monk weapon. 
Kinrest	....maybe
Kinrest	Base locations, scout routes, guard shifts, documents on what they have, how much of it, and where they're going (if anywhere). Important info might be found on his work desk or on book shelves. But nothing as vital as passwords, secret entrances, BBEG's weakness, etc. Information *that* vital wouldn't be risked written down. 
Kinrest	Everyone has that one song they never get tired of listening. What's yours? | 
Kinrest	The only significant difference is as you level up the Rapier's damage wont level as your monk weapons would. And that's not really a big deal. 
Kinrest	Well, if you're DM is aware of the truth and allows it then it should be fine. 
Kinrest	Didn't mean to accuse, just sharing my experience.   If you haven't reached level 3 yet, I'd recommend checking out the Way of the Kensei monk tradition. This monk specializes in weapons, giving you the option to turn any martial weapons (one-handed and non-heavy still) into 'Kensei' weapons which classifies them as monk weapons *and* some additional features. 
Kinrest	Where do I find the Steam Link authorization code? | I just received the Steam Link and now my computer is asking for the authorization code so I can play my games. I can't seem to find it on or in the package. Where is it supposed to be found?
Kinrest	To summon him one person needs to say his name 3 times. If three people say it one each nothing will happen. 
Kinrest	Knight, if I could prove my noble heritage. If not then bartender. 
Kinrest	Depends on what you want to do in life. What's your dream job and where are you working now?
Kinrest	Bad v good quality slave trade? | In one of my campaigns I was planning on having a few slave traders. Legal in some areas, not so legal in others. But not all slaves are equal in quality and therefore price. What might be some features or defects to alter the price?   For example; young beautiful women would likely cost more than elderly men; straight teeth, no missing parts, clean hair, etc. What races might cost more than others? 
Kinrest	What are some good Dwarven/Russian city names? | I've made a kingdom of mostly Dwarves and I'm basing it around Cold War Russia culture. What might be some of the city names?
Kinrest	[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQgRU2Kq_zc&t=247s&list=PL83FKhfEDI1J0FJhhxP3PVzM-vtTgWPKU&index=9) might help. 
Kinrest	An amazing view. 
Kinrest	Wow, that's a lot cheaper than I thought they'd be. Thanks, this helps a lot. 
Kinrest	Mine was the sawing a person in half trick. But my assistant split. 
Kinrest	In a sense, one could 'speak' through the written(typed) word. 
Kinrest	So you're in the market and come across a male human slave; average build, mid 20s to mid 30s, and born into slavery and has been one through different masters/mistresses throughout his life. What might the price? As a base for pricing other slaves. 
Kinrest	1/3
Kinrest	I work so late I don't get home until roughly 7 in the morning. Obviously, she's asleep by then. So before I climb into bed with her I leave little, cheesy love notes for her to wake up to each morning. 
Kinrest	Huh?
Kinrest	I suppose it is. But now I'm as rough as my partner is comfortable with. I'd call it a learned experience. 
Kinrest	Then perhaps aim for higher paying positions in your current work place or another. If you can get higher ranking in a higher class place then you'll be getting closer to owning a restaurant. Plus you'll get paid more so you'll be able to open one yourself. 
Kinrest	I wasn't rough enough with her in bed. 
Kinrest	What do you need/want?
Kinrest	"I was looking through the history books, and I noticed a few years were missing. Starting with 2016. What the hell happened?"
Kinrest	Still beautiful
Kinrest	You're not willing to put in any physical effort into finding a job or earn an income. This is being lazy. But you're right, that was rude of me and unnecessary. Sorry.   Now, are you claiming jobs and businesses didn't exist until internet? There are several successful businesses that have little to no online presence. I work as a bartender and nearly every bar I've worked in don't have online profiles or websites. 
Kinrest	This can apply to any town or city. Get off your lazy, unemployed butt and go find a job. 
Kinrest	Not sure if this a twist, but 'd get a friend to dress the same way so we can corner or cut off the 'victim'. Make them think I (or the other one) can teleport and just *might* be real. 
Kinrest	"I love you."
Kinrest	Mix it with bleach and flush it in the toilet. The bleach damages the DNA to the point where it's *nearly* impossible to use. Plus given the fact that someone has to sift through sewer waste just isn't worth it. 
Kinrest	I'd probably try my damnest to get as far from the impact point as I could. 
Kinrest	I go look for one. Not al available jobs will advertise them on websites. Walk around town and keep an eye out for 'HELP WANTED' signs. 
Kinrest	Would you support the proposal of a Purge in your country? Why/why not? | 
Kinrest	I'd just have normal sex. Just to see what it's like from the female perspective. 
Kinrest	From my personal, third person experience, there is a 100% chance I'll get divorced. 
Kinrest	Every adult in my life that's been married have gotten divorced in less than 5 years. Therefore I have little respect for marriage and why I'm hesitant to ask my gf to marry me. 
Kinrest	Looks clean enough to eat off. 
Kinrest	Going down on a woman. 
Kinrest	Alucard (Hellsing Ultimate) vs Dracula (Castlevania) | I know they're technically the same person, but the two characters have vastly different abilities. So who do you think would win should they be pit against each other?
Kinrest	I'd like to sleep a full 8hrs but for some reason I can only sleep in 4 hour increments. 
Kinrest	I feel I should take that personally. But Californians kinda suck. 
Kinrest	I don't see any reason a woman can't propose. I was raised traditional so I may feel a little emasculated, but in the end I'll have married the woman I love. 
Kinrest	Mime
Kinrest	You mean with your own? Or with someone else's?
Kinrest	I'll bite. Ha!   Honestly don't really know. Nearly every girl I've ever been with said I ate them out better than anyone else. I focus on the clit most of the time and finger them at the same time. That's usually what I do. I always thought that's how it's normally done. 
Kinrest	In a sense, yes. But it was my direct action that killed him. Had I done something different we could have both lived. 
Kinrest	It's a violation of their privacy, trespassing, and potentially theft if you were to take it home with you. 
Kinrest	While working at a bar a woman tried calling the cops on me accusing me of raping her in the bar. This is all because she believed I over charged her for a cocktail. 
Kinrest	Why the hell would you want to know?
Kinrest	Always fantasized about a threeway with a mother and daughter. People tell me that's weird. 
Kinrest	It made for a interesting story, she was obviously in a bad part of her life, and I came out of it relatively fine. And like I said, it would have been too much of a hassle to deal with. 
Kinrest	These would be the only monasteries that practice any of these traditions. If there were others, they were either destroyed or forgotten. There could be embassies of this nation in other kingdoms where these traditions are practiced, but not to such a scale they could be referred to as monasteries.

I do know they had someone break into the restaurant a few weeks ago. Broke one of the windows and climbed through it.   [Dozier's in Fulshear](http://doziersbbq.com) is pretty good. It's a bit of a drive but [CorkSkrew](https://www.corkscrewbbq.com/) is arguably the best BBQ in Houston. My grandparents live in Conroe so it's not too far out of the way for us. [Tejas in Tomball](http://tejaschocolate.com/menu/) is also really good from what I hear.   
ryan3243	Idk what you're talking about. [This mashup is the greatest mashup ever created.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR5CRHNr3zc) The originality and pure creativity that went into making this track is simply unrivaled. Armin continues to prove time and time again that he is the king of trance. I can't wait to hear this at the end of every set for the next 5+ years. What an absolute god.
ryan3243	>~~Ranch 99~~ 99 Ranch :p    >Marini's Empanadas    > Tiger Noodle House    >~~Joyluck~~ Joy Love is better    >Ritters Frozen Custard  All good. Especially 99 Ranch and Marini's. While I really like Ritter's, being lactose intolerant makes it difficult to eat a lot of.   * Rudy's is alright, but I'd rather drive a bit for better if I wanted BBQ.  * I didn't know Fadi's was finally open. Definitely going to hit them up. Cedar's is pretty good. Ephesus is also great for Mediterranean.  * Bonchon looks super expensive so I'll probably pass on that.  * Not too big a fan of Indian food so pass on Udipi as well. * Actually walked out of Willy Burger after staring at the menu for 10 minutes. Wasn't impressed. * Mod Pizza looks interesting. Might have to check them out. Depends on the pricing.  >Honestly I haven't noticed much hipster food out there but I gues it depends on what you consider "hipster".  Small portions, high prices, vegan/organic/farm to table...maybe hipster is the wrong word for it, Idk. I'm just against paying $10 for three tacos or $20+ for a medium/large pizza. 
ryan3243	> Piggy Pibil    > Local Table/Bar    > Hoodadak    > El Canton  Over-priced and/or hipster bullshit.  >Proud Pie  They must be really proud with those prices.  > Tacos Y Tortas Adrian    > Las Mañanitas    > Las Tarascas    > Ruthie's    > Victor's     I'll take Tony's over any of these all day.  > El Kourmet    > Joy Love Burger    > Tiger Noodle House     These were pretty good.  I didn't realize El Kourmet just moved to another location. Thought they were gone when they disappeared from next to JCI.   > Kingdom Bakery    > Da Vinci     They're on my list to visit.  > Spicy Isle     Added to the list.  ----  My point was not complaining about what already exists, it's complaining about what they keep putting in.

ryan3243	Too bad he didn't get rid of the shitty voiceover. Track would have been great if it weren't for the voiceover.
ryan3243	Long vocal samples and triplets are what get me to instantly turn a track off and never listen willingly again. I can't stand either of them.
ryan3243	That's why I don't like a shitload of tech trance.
ryan3243	Thank god something other than a noodle, chicken, or chain place. Looks promising. 
ryan3243	Aly & Fila - FSOE 513 (Beyond The Lights Album Special) [Radio Show] | 
ryan3243	He's doing random Dakota stuff. Except it doesn't sound like Dakota, it sounds like Markus. His latest is really subpar. At least the title accurately describes my thoughts after listening to it. We won't even talk about [Running Up That Hill.](https://soundcloud.com/markusschulz/runningupthathill) I'm sure there will be an album at some point. TBH, I don't think anything could top the first.

ryan3243	Sound design. 
ryan3243	MUH SOUND DESIGN!  Feel free to post your opinion as long as it agrees with the Above & Beyond fanboys. But I completely agree. Their production quality is simply unmatched. People on here value more than just sound design so they have higher standards than to just accept whatever A&B throw out regardless of how good the sound design is.  Analogue Dreams is going to be the same boring sound they've been putting out for years now. A.I. 2.0 because it's the same formula with the same sounds, same structures, same lots of things. Just like 90% of the rest of their releases in the last 5+ years.

ryan3243	"Cheesy" and "good" are subjective. I mean, they could just not bother to put any trance on the lineup. Only festival in the US to have a dedicated trance stage for the whole festival. Not to mention several other dedicated trance festivals. Maybe you missed the whole Dreamstate thing? Lineups have gotten a lot better. Not like you were going to go anyway so idk why you're complaining. 
ryan3243	They must not since they had an entire stage dedicated to it last year for the whole weekend. Makes sense. 
ryan3243	Unfortunately I have to remove this as it's chillout.

ryan3243	EDC:LV May 18-20, 2018 @ Las Vegas Motor Speedway | [Official Announcement via Pasquale Rotella](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYtcc4eBSte/?taken-by=pasqualerotella)  > Here’s the big news! After a lot of energy, passion and hard work, I want to personally present to you EDC Las Vegas 2018. New hours, new stages, and new dates with better weather and camping. That’s right—campsites, RVs, sound camps, and more—for the first time ever at EDC Las Vegas. Wake up and walk in. Over the past 10 years, average high temps on this weekend in May have been 90 and the lows have been 64. This means we can extend our hours and create an opening ceremony on the cosmicMEADOW lawn featuring extended sets from different artists each day. One stage, one vibe—all before the rest of the experience turns on. Not only will it give people a chance to vibe out before sunset, but the early arrivals will help the flow in and out of the Speedway. Shuttle operations will be handed over to an independent company that specializes in the largest music and sporting events in the country. This is what they do and they do it better than anyone else, year over year. Also new for 2018, construction in the immediate area of the Speedway will finally be complete. In 2017 we had just two lanes. EDC Las Vegas 2018 will have three lanes plus pull-offs. There will be traffic in and out of the festival, but if you want a one-and-done journey to the Speedway, just camp out. We’ll be rolling out more details in the coming weeks, and I’ll be personally answering your questions live on my Instagram. Tickets and camping passes go on sale at the end of September, but hotels are available now on our website with no markup. EDC Las Vegas 2018 is going to be an amazing new adventure and I can't wait to see you there! #EDCLV2018 #ArtCommunityCamping #RVsAreWelcomeHere  [Announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gCcjt5kIdE)
ryan3243	Same thoughts I had. Plus I don't understand everyone's obsession with Hailene.

ryan3243	It's about 5 too many :P  At least it's not as bad as Corsten's album.

Arcane_Pozhar	Traffic cops of NYC and other major cities, why do you not more aggressively ticket drivers who "block the box", AKA end up smack in the middle of the intersection, interfering with cross-traffic? | 
Arcane_Pozhar	Side note:  I like the idea of any profession that requires hundreds of hours of practice and study (medicine, PHD level knowlwedge on a subject, etc) requiring a stunt (which also would give a bonus on a specific subset).  This could lead to a LOT of different stunts, don't have any great examples.  To answer more directly, I know I had one along the lines of "Combat Medic ", allowing one to treat serious wounds and giving a +1 I believe.  Sorry the details are a little fuzzy.
Arcane_Pozhar	I would imagine 2, 1 for each stunt.
Arcane_Pozhar	Traffic cops of NYC and other major cities, why do you not hit people with traffic tickets for "blocking the box"? | [removed]
Arcane_Pozhar	Strippers.
Arcane_Pozhar	I take it Medusa is not your strongest character of the group.
Arcane_Pozhar	I'm under the impression he's pretty darn close to top tier.  This will help, for sure.
Arcane_Pozhar	His Yellow is VERY dependent on your teams strongest color...  on the rare occssions I used him with my higher level Medusa, I was getting more yellow from his yellow, with no other power to spend it on, making his yellow useless.  Also, in PVP on Defense, Carol could use her yellow on his CD tile, destroying it for little or no effect.    Anyone with a strong expensive power for their strongest color can benefit from his extra AP.  Also, do NOT underestimate how good his blue and red can both be for board manipulation.  I have pulled off some crazy moves with him.  It's not always about getting the most red, not when there are cascades and match-5s to set up.  
Arcane_Pozhar	IM40 can go okay with Captain Marvel, all those countdown tiles he makes can trigger her passive repeatedly, though she can't really take advantage of any of the AP he makes, so you would want to choose the right 3rd party member.  Scarlet Witch's also constantly making a countdown tile, so she could help buff any special tiles you have as well.  Add in iron fist (3 star), and you have someone who can take Scarlet Witch's purple and make black from it for Carol to use.  He can also make strike tiles as well.  The big weakness with that team is that they have no red or blue users, and I found that having two dead colors can be a little annoying, but with that team you're guaranteed to be getting AP that you need from Scarlet witches passive if nothing else.  3 star hawk guy probably goes well with Colson, he has a cheap power that makes a count down tile, so lots of synergy right there.  You could also use colsons purple to protect a countdown tile that gets placed in a bad spot, in a pinch.  And Hawk guys purple creating strike tiles does very well with Colton's passive that creates a damaging countdown tile whenever a power is fired.  For Gamora I'd probably recommend three stars that can stun, Spider-Man can make purple protect tiles to help trigger her passive sometimes, though you would probably want to use her stun, not his, and he also packs a hard-hitting yellow.    You could also do switch and Iron Fist again, the team would be lacking a yellow but it has multiple ways to stun and deal damage.    I'm sure there's other possibilities, but I'm tired.  Congrats on getting some awesome four stars (*edit-  almost* ) championed, all three of them are some of my top characters to play with.
Arcane_Pozhar	You are one of those lucky early Grinders, good for you. If I've been psychic and known that this was going to happen I probably could have gotten number one placement in the event. Not that this would be the most important thing to be psychic about, but still.
Arcane_Pozhar	Well the nice thing about stronger strike tiles though is that it stacks so nicely with every independent source of damage.  So if you get a lucky Cascade, those tiles help multiple times. If you have attack tiles, your strike tiles get to deal damage again.  Ganora's red, Medusa's red, rocket and groots blue, and I'm sure plenty of other powers that I'll hit turn after turn all benefit from having stronger attack tiles out.  With that being said, I like that this is one of the characters that definitely has different viable builds depending on how you use him and who you team him up with.
Arcane_Pozhar	I'm not seeing the logic here. Playing the game to get ISO isn't what keeps it going, people paying money on the game is what keeps it going. And right now if I could Champion a few of the four star characters I have on the vine, I would pay out a decent chunk of money to do so. Which (for perspective) in my Current financial situation is 1 or 2 hundred, but that would have to save at least a few four star characters for me, instead that would get me approximately half of one, it's insanely ineffective.  I actually would have been better off if I had just shelled out that money for hero points weeks ago, and kept buying the heroes for hire store has it rotated through.  I did a post a couple months ago about how you get more ISO by buying hero points and using it on that store than you do by buying ISO.  With that said, part of me does appreciate that the game is not completely pay to win, unless you're absolutely Filthy Rich of course and you can afford the iso anyway.  If I won the lotto you could bet your butt I'd put a few thousand dollars into iso just to finish Champion four stars.  TL,DR:  they don't actually directly financially benefit from us playing the game for forever for ISO, they benefit from when we make purchases. So it makes more sense that ISO is so ineffective for reasons such as game balance, not letting the game be completely pay to win ( and also for the insane amount of profit they must make on people who are rich enough and desperate enough to buy it).
Arcane_Pozhar	He is definitely one of the worst three star characters now, they'll probably get around to buffing him eventually, but I wouldn't count on it being anytime soon.  Hopefully they fix 4-star Falcon first
Arcane_Pozhar	Most players who are pvping really hard are at a very high level and are running a big HP Surplus, I realize that there are exceptions to that where you might have a newer player who needs a health pack, but 50hp is like nothing once your high-level player and have rostered everyone.  Which I admit, is taking longer and longer to do has to keep adding more characters to the game, but at least they've been getting more generous with rewards to help newer players catch up faster.
Arcane_Pozhar	At the seven million level, it completely totally blows the Stark salary out of the water, are you kidding me? That's enough to Champ almost half the four stars in the game right now I'm pretty sure.  Personally I could see myself spending money if it was around 4 or 5 hundred thousand ISO for $100, that's enough to champ a 4-star with some to spare, plus the extra command points doesn't hurt, especially if I join a buyer's club right before I do it.
Arcane_Pozhar	Not to give you a hard time, but there is no such thing as a 5-star Spider-Man Yellow cover, so what did you draw?  Daredevil has yellow, the newest Spider-Man is red green and blue.
Arcane_Pozhar	But you don't spend money to grind iso....  you just play.  If you're saying people will pay for stronger rosters to grind iso faster.....  that's true, but what most of us dedicated, long term players need for stronger rosters is more iso, and most of us won't pay that absurd proce for iso.  I feel like either your logic is flawed, or it's sound but you're not explaining a step or two in your chain of thought.  I assure you, the things they have done to keep me a dedicated, VIP purchasing player have been things that have either increased rewards for the same amount of time played, or decreased the amount of time I need to play (thanks new SCL based scaling!).  Anything that would make me have to play more to get my iso would lead to a decrease in sales, not an increase.
Arcane_Pozhar	Well, to complicate your argument, I'm sure I'm not the only person who would adjust my spending habits if they adjusted the prices, so it's not a question of what one person would do, it's a question of what everybody in my shoes would do, and what the repercussions would be.  But I do think you put forth a decent simulation.
Arcane_Pozhar	We didn't, this kind of helped, though another 5,000 Iso would have made a big difference.
Arcane_Pozhar	Okay, I have way too much to do to dig into the details of this, but the early do exist players out there who buy ISO, because they're crazy Rich, the reason they're not completely ruining the game right now is because they're very very rare, so they're not hogging the top spots in every slice of every event I'm pretty sure anyway.  Also, unless I'm misreading you, you're agreeing with me, you're just spelling out in far far far more detail what I stated, or am I missing something?
Arcane_Pozhar	That's very true, when you're first playing 50 hero points for one health pack seems like a lot, it's not till later on where the economy of hero points changes
Arcane_Pozhar	I think you're missing my point, I'm saying that it's not a ridiculous price, it's pretty darn cheap, for high-level players. One of the perks of getting farther ahead in this game is your income does grow as you go.
Arcane_Pozhar	I was just going to come down here to mention this, I have seen this for Pun Max and Iceman now.
Arcane_Pozhar	Once in a blue moon I've seen a post like this, but only a couple of times, and as much as that seems like really bad luck, I once pulled six five stars in a row, which is even less likely.  So crazy luck can happen in this game.
Arcane_Pozhar	They seem to have changed HFH so that if you get an unusable 13th cover, the cover you need will pop up in the store, so don't worry too much about buying the 13th cover you need.  Though, their seem to be some rumors that it is not showing up for everyone?  Gonna have to ask around a little.
Arcane_Pozhar	Or you could not spend 120, get the cover from another means, and still get the LT.  I almost spent 120 once, but I wasn't going to kid myself and say that getting that one LT made it worth it, it was going to be so I could use 4 Lord in PVP.
Arcane_Pozhar	That only works if the next 4 star cover from that 3 star is the one you need, though that should trigger the new and improved, reactive Heros for Hire store, if you can afford that.
Arcane_Pozhar	I think anyone who knows enough to save to 300 knows to stop once they get the good results, or once they get a good result, depending on exactly what it was they were looking for.  That's so obvious I didn't feel the need to spell it out, especially considering someone else did.
Arcane_Pozhar	But people have pointed out how you can effectively beat the odds by doing it. Maybe we're using that phrase little differently, and of course it's possible that people who pull all the time could get the four stars left and right, if they get lucky.  But if you're patient and willing to play it right, it is quite possible in the very long term to get better odds.
Arcane_Pozhar	I'm sorry to downvote you here, and it's obvious that you have a fairly good grasp on how the sort of thing works, but you're missing the value of being able to guarantee yourself a 4-star cover when you really want it.   And the comparison you make about rolling a die down below isn't really accurate either, because a die does not function the same as a vault, with a vault you can only get any given result once, whereas with a die in theory you could roll sixes all day if probability was being weird.  In short, it's dangerous to assume you're going to get average results with anything of this sort.  Therefore, if you're at the point where what your roster desperately needs are specific 4-star covers, hoarding make sense, because you can give yourself that guarantee.  Otherwise, I feel most players are at the point where they should just spend the tokens and get the rewards now to strengthen their roster and earn more champ rewards.  And on a personal note, I generally hoard Taco tokens so I can use them to get myself Health packs when I need them for a tougher PVP event.
Arcane_Pozhar	See, there's two trains of thoughts on this, one is that as somebody who still rostering more characters, any chance you have to earn more two and three star covers is worth it for the champion rewards, specifically the hero points.  The other is to try and maximize the vault by saving until you have 300 and then pulling until you've gotten most or all of the good results from the vault.  Honestly, I feel the only players that really need to be saving their Taco tokens are the ones who have an established roster who really just need to be able to guarantee them self a certain 4-star cover when it pops up in the vault.  By the time you save up 300 tokens, who knows how many covers you might have to throw away because you don't have the iso to Champ the character, or the hero points to roster the character.  With that said, I would skip any Vault that has a four-star in it that you can't roster, because it defeats the point of opening tokens to build up your roster if you open tokens and get covers you have to throw away.
Arcane_Pozhar	I really think players are not going to put more money in this game just because the icons look better.  My common sense is telling me that that's a complaint shared by this poster and maybe a couple other people.
Arcane_Pozhar	See, you're saying that Loki and I am 40 can work, and on the offense, sure, that's true.  But you're opening yourself up to very easy retaliations.  Every single person who used im40 with Peggy in PVP this week I attacked and defeated, no problem.  Maybe if he had been posted he might have been able to actually get off a recharge before I killed him once in awhile.  And I'm just a player with a Solid 4 star roster, somebody with a high-level 5-star would squish him even faster.
Arcane_Pozhar	Pfffff, 3 star characters just don't have the damage or HP to compete,  though you're right that he does have a somewhat similar passive to one of my suggestions.  If his attack tiles scaled off the strength of the tiles he matched away, he would be much more valuable.
Arcane_Pozhar	 It's not just you, it happened to me, and it happened to I think a couple of the puzzle Warriors
Arcane_Pozhar	I swear whenever somebody mentions that they've got a lot of Star-Lord covers, it's always purple.  I was so happy when they made him be the reward from a boss event several months ago, I finally got the 3rd red I needed.
Arcane_Pozhar	That's pretty true about almost every character, maybe the last comment is extra true for her, but I don't really see what point you're trying to make.  Just because the character has some weaknesses doesn't mean that they're not a big part of the meta right now, it just means that the game is designed halfway decently ( better than halfway decently, honestly, characters with no weaknesses would be a sign of some pretty shoddy game production).    To be fair, the fact that her weaknesses are the same as almost every other character it's just a reflection of the design behind stun and Airborne powers.  But the powers are balanced appropriately, considering that they work on 99% of characters in the game with no drawback.  Anyway, I went from saying that I don't see your point to analyzing stun and airborne, so let me just conclude by saying that while I agree with your statement, I don't see what you're trying to prove.
Arcane_Pozhar	I generally don't like it when people respond to comments like this with "learn to play", and I do agree that she's a powerful character (and could probably use a small decrease to her numbers to be better balanced, along with several other of the newer characters), but she certainly not unbeatable.  While her hit points are fairly decent, they are still low enough that she can be one shot by many of the stronger powers in 4 star land, or by two different medium strength attacks at once.  Carol is one of my main choices to take her out, but I could see Mordo, Cyclops, Hulkbuster, and I'm sure several others doing it in one hit, or pretty much any 4 star damage dealer doing it in 2.  Additionally, if you stun her, you then have a great opportunity to match away opponents tiles without her healing back up, and her countdown tile doesn't do damage while she's stunned, though you still have to be careful about matching it away.  Gamora is pretty ideal for this at the moment, but there are other good stunners in 3 to 5 star land.  TL; DR:  she's good, but either stun her and kill her, or just one shot her with a harder hitting power (or two medium strength powers).
Arcane_Pozhar	Probably looking too much into it.  Unless you're very high level, sometimes it's just unavoidable.  The RNG factor of what AP you can gather, what cascades the enemy will get, where they will place CD tiles (influencing if you can match them away or not), all will influence how much damage you take.  Also, some enemies are harder than others, and will deal more damage to you.  It's hard to stop Ares from firing his green, or Daken his blue, they are just so cheap.  With that said, if you find yourself using health packs all the time, to the point where you are running out often, you should probably drop one SCL until you level your characters more.  But it didn't sound like you're in that rough of a spot.
Arcane_Pozhar	Very good suggestions!  I must say, though, if you've never heard somebody say "learn to play" in malice, you must not have gone very deep into the internet. Hopefully I didn't come across that bad.
Arcane_Pozhar	Once upon a time, a long time ago, I cared about not using health packs. I was an idiot. Now I probably typically use about 3 to 5 for each set of clears, if the opponents have characters that actually make matches.  If it's just goons I usually don't need to use them, but sometimes they'll get lucky.  But when you stop to consider that the game recharges Health packs if you have less than ten, there's nothing wrong with the fact that I use them to keep my best characters going. Because once you start using Champion 4 star characters for your clears, it's generally not fun to take a hit on clear time just because you're trying to save a health back or 3.  What made me snap out of it was realizing that there really wasn't a point to me saving all those Health packs. Sure, once in awhile when I'm in the middle of an intense PVP event I might have to buy 5 more Health packs, but that's pretty rare, and consistently having faster clears because I'm always using my best characters is well worth a couple hundred hero points once in a blue moon.
Arcane_Pozhar	He is great the way he is for PVE, and for PVP, the game really needs a character who would be a good counter for special tile heavy teams.  Medusa is currently one of the best, with her ability to steal them, or get AP when they are matched, but I'm thinking someone with a passive that more directly rewards you when you match away enemy tiles.  Maybe someone that creates a tile for your team when you match an enemy tile, at 15/30/45/60/80% of the strength of the tile you matched away.  Would go well with several characters, and would be great for taking those tiles away from R&G.  Or maybe just a character who passivly removes or weakens an enemy special tile at the start of the turn, if there are more than say 6/5/4/3/3 of them.  At level 5 it could remove/weaken 2 per turn.  Lots of ways to tweak that power, not going to go into them all.  Hmmmm, this was a fun design exercise for me.  Wish I worked for the company...
Arcane_Pozhar	You mean take away her healing, but make her SUPREMELY good at AP generation?  You would regret that change.  And her red is WAY better than IF's attack tile, because you can get several copies of her attack tiles going, and because the countdown tile counts as a separate source of damage from Attack tiles, which means if you have strike tiles on the board they double dip.
Arcane_Pozhar	Retina quality icons?  Please explain...
Arcane_Pozhar	At the 4 star level, she's a big part of it.
Arcane_Pozhar	I do hope it gets better over time though, with unvaulting actually allowing people a halfway decent chance at leveling characters out of the current 12, and slowing down the rapid power gain of the characters in the current 12.
Arcane_Pozhar	Just to clarify, because I don't know if anyone specifically spelled this out, the only way to get those sort of insanely fast clear times is to have really high level characters.  As others have mentioned, characters like Medusa, Rocket and Groot, Thanos (5-stsr)and a few others can all really help, but for those super super quick clear times you need to have them champed, and then have applied a bunch of champion levels to them.  Or, when the four stars are boosted for a week, my clear time definitely speeds up by a good 20, 30% as well.  But even with that boost I'm still not close to hitting 20-minute clear times, because I'm just not at that level of play.  Maybe when my Medusa and Rocket and Groot have 50 more champ levels each, I might be able to boast that sort of time when they're boosted.
Arcane_Pozhar	He wasn't talking about a 5-star with one Black cover, he's talking about a champion 5-star, you don't appreciate how powerful those are until you either fight them in PvP, or have one of your own to use in PVE. The numbers that a champion 5-star puts out can crush even Shield clearance level 8 PVE enemies very quickly.
Arcane_Pozhar	I wasn't saying her red Power needs to be taken down, I was just pointing out how it's way better than iron fists.  Even if you took her AP generation down that low though, all you'd have to do is pair her with someone like Carnage who constantly is making tiles for both teams, or use her against characters who make a lot of tiles like falcon or storm, and she'd still be an insane AP generator.  Also, I think the idea that every character only has one Niche is just bad character design.  I realize a lot of the older characters kind of seem to be designed that way (they have one or two good powers and then one or two bad powers), but I'm actually impressed how a lot of the newer characters have more flexibility, and there's more interesting discussion about how to build them for various teams.  
Arcane_Pozhar	That would really hurt her viability, though.  Her CD tile is one of the best things about her.  I agree that Blade could use a small scalling back to his damage numbers even more than Medusa needs perhaps a small hit to her healing and HP.
Arcane_Pozhar	Something that punishes the enemy team whenever one of their countdowns expires would be way too strong, or when fighting characters that don't make countdown tiles, useless. Maybe if it was an active power, and you used it and that effect was in play for a couple of turns, then it could be balanced, but as a passive that's going all the time, it sounds pretty brutal.  Unless it only did something very tiny, like weakening special tiles by small amount, or stealing one or two AP.
Arcane_Pozhar	To clarify even further, unless I'm grossly misunderstanding something, there is no arbitrary limit on the possible people you could come across in matchmaking. It's simply restricted based on the strength of your roster, so if you're a five-star player, I'm pretty sure you're not going to be seeing any players that don't even have a champed 3 start yet.  So in theory there could be thousands of other players whose rosters you're looking at when you're going through PVP opponents, but of course it's also influenced based on score, if you're at 600 points for the event, you're not going to see somebody who's only at 100 points.
Arcane_Pozhar	Me too, I used to use her in the Marvel's Avengers Alliance Facebook game, and she was super awesome.  I just found out the other day that that game closed down last year, and it breaks my heart.
Arcane_Pozhar	I think a power that lets you use the enemies own powers and AP against them is probably a bit overkill.  Compare it to any power that only steals AP, and it becomes clear how brokenly good your power is.  With that said, I do like the idea of throwing someone's own powers back at them.
Arcane_Pozhar	I was actually designing my own version of Coulson,  shortly before he was released.  Yellow was a summom allies type power, more like Nick Fury's Avengers Assemble.  Blue was going to make some proteft tiles and maybe also be similar to either Spider Woman or Colossus, making Coulson be more tanky.  Purple I don't remember what it was going to do exactly, but it was going to involve making extra AP.  So my design was pretty similar, in general, though obviously not as OP as the final design. 
Arcane_Pozhar	It will strongly affect your PVP opponents, assuming you play much PVP.  I would not put iso into him until you have more champed 4 stars. 
Arcane_Pozhar	I almost put Mockingbird, but I have had almost no luck getting covers for her since her release event.  Soon I'll have to favorite her if I don't get some luck in the next few months.  But yeah, I can see her being awesome.
Arcane_Pozhar	New favorite character survey, curious what people answered. | I went with Doctor Strange for my three star, Agent Coulson for my 4-star, and Hawkeye for my five star. Just curious what others have put.
Arcane_Pozhar	She goes great with IM40 and a strong red blue user.   She does need an AP gemerator, but she's great, even unboosted.
Arcane_Pozhar	Back in the day when my vision was higher level than my IM 40, I would use the two of them with Loki. Against other three star teams in PvP it was surprisingly effective as long as you could get yellow, or get red and blue.  And seeing has the AI loves to make match fours, Loki helped that AP to come in.  Kamala Khan probably would have also been a good substitute for Loki, but I just loved his AP steal so much.
Arcane_Pozhar	I'm assuming the OP meant responded to, I agree that countering is a weird way to phrase it
Arcane_Pozhar	I could not snap my fingers until I learned that  (seversl years ago).  I think some kids cartoon showed it wrong, so I always tried to do it funny.
Arcane_Pozhar	But if he sabotages his farm now, he's going to be getting tight on hero points. The point of a 2-star farm isn't the 2-star covers at all, it's the 3-star covers and the hero points.  Honestly, once he's an established player, he can get four star covers easily enough as well.
Arcane_Pozhar	I've seen people mention that they use him for his blue sometimes.  I don't think it needs a change.     I agree that his rwd coyld use some love for sure.
Arcane_Pozhar	Good point. To be fair, he's certainly not the only character who depends on having a certain color on the board to be fairly effective. Blade with red comes to mind, but honestly there's a decent number of characters out there where there's always one power I want to use the most, and if I can't make matches in that color the character just isn't worth as much.    With that said, I do feel like Cap Falcon is near the top of that list, because his yellow really isn't that special unless you're going to use it for some sort of combo with other characters, and his red is just so expensive, so if people are bringing him to a fight it probably is for his blue.
Arcane_Pozhar	As a father, I have refered to my son that way on special occasion, so it did not strike me as odd.  But I am a huge geek, so...
Arcane_Pozhar	When a gentleman came up to give him the awards, he out them on the table in front of Jim, and said "Fuego", it was pretty cool.
Arcane_Pozhar	Many higher level players who are set on roster spots have been saving extra HP in preperation for the anniversary in just about a month, so "very few" is  probably a bit low of an estimate.
Arcane_Pozhar	In theory I would use it to save a 5 star cover, a few times before Bonus Heroes I considered using it for a 4 star, but it just wasn't worth it to give up 6 pulls.  I now have almost 1000 saved, because when I do start spending on Classics (once I catch up on iso) I might get Strange covers, and if the colors are wrong I'm going to have to buy one...  Also, if a new 5 star is exciting enough, I'll spend a few trying to get a first cover for them.  But I don't do that often.
Arcane_Pozhar	It's generally a gopd idea if you're a halfway seriois player to have all the 2 stars through 4 stars, for when they are required for PVE and  (for 3 stars mostly) for PVP.
Arcane_Pozhar	In general,  I would say no.  A low covered 4 star would be a better choice to sell, if you're desperste for slots.  As another pointed out, getting 5 star covers is hard.
Arcane_Pozhar	I think he would be MUCH better if, when his yellow activated it's damage, it only removed a certain number of protect tiles, not all of them.  Because as much as protect tiles aren't that exciting, it is nice to have at least a few of them out.
Arcane_Pozhar	I wouldn't wait for them to do it again, I would address how fucked up their behavior is now.  If I was that girl's parents, I would be looking to press charges already for the harrasment and the attempts to touch her without her consent.  Not sure what crime that would be, technically, but I suspect sexual harrasment and maybe sexual assault?    So, OP, do whatever you can to make your friends learn that this is NOT OK, both for the ladies sake, and for your friends futures.
Arcane_Pozhar	Nope, no leveled 5 stars, already have several maxed or near maxed 3 stars.
Arcane_Pozhar	No, it's not wrong.  Discovered them about a month ago myself, and I firmly believe mpst of them eother need help, or need to be walked away before they hurt innocent women (or men, but I suspect they would be more likely to target women) when they get pushed too far into their delusional states of anger and outwardly focused blame.
Arcane_Pozhar	Congrats!  I had some great pulls today too (though not that good), glad others are getting lucky too!
Arcane_Pozhar	Trump.
Arcane_Pozhar	Jim announces two more serues at Dragon con panel, was he serious? [Spoilers all] | So, just listened to him talk about a series with Maggie at (a magical) school, and a series focusing on Goodman Grey.  Has this been announced before, and how serious is he?  Have not heard of these before.  The Maggie one would be a little more YA focused, and would touch upon how messed up her social life is with her tragic past, the Goodman Grey one would be focused on problems that need a monster to be dealth with, because he's a monster for hire.
Arcane_Pozhar	Since nobody clarified this, the ONLY difference between Latest and Classic tokens are in the 5 stars, your better luck notwithstanding.  So unless you're ready for 5 star land, enjoy the cheaper tokens and stick with Classics.
Arcane_Pozhar	5 stars, not 4 stars.  They would not have done anything for your Mordo. 
Arcane_Pozhar	Just curious if this ever came together and you have pics you would want to share with the sub?
Arcane_Pozhar	It really irks me that I cannot find a forun post or anything with the details of his original stats.  I believe everyone, but it's quite annoying to not know details. 
Arcane_Pozhar	What was his original form like? I remember hearing people saying that he supposedly had a red Power first, but I don't remember that, and I've been playing this game since it came out of beta.
Arcane_Pozhar	I could have sworn this was pointed out just about a month or two ago....  does anyone know if this was mentioned in our beginner's guide, because it should be made clear for people from the beginning.
Arcane_Pozhar	Ummmm.... IW is, X Force Wolverine was changed a few times, and this current version is NOT his strongest by far.
Arcane_Pozhar	(Spoilers Dead beat) Trying to find campfire scene, what chapter? | So, I am about to be at Dragon con and get some thimgs signed, and I'm bringing my copy of Dead Beat, because Malcolm Dresden appears a few times and I have a personal connection to the name.  So, with that said, can anyone point me to the chapter where Dresden is dreaming/knocked out/whatever and his dad makes the Alice in Wonderland reference?
Arcane_Pozhar	Honestly as much as I love those characters, Carol in particular needed at least a bit of a Nerf, and this is a good way to do it.  I honestly still think she is a little bit stronger than she needs to be, but this at least shuts down some of the ridiculous combos with her.
Arcane_Pozhar	I want to pair him with Coulson and 5-Star Hawkeye, big time.  He brings the Black and Green that they are missing, while also generating AP, countdowns, and bringing tile removal in a pinch.
Arcane_Pozhar	Vulture has not been mentioned.  Use his Black to make blue (but be careful it doesn't autofire his blue, if you want it for strange).  Iceman, 4-Carol *IF* your teams strongest is blue, Medusa sometimes when matching enemy special tiles, randomly Coulson could make it,  Wasps blue passice could steal you some (but you need to keep some in reserve for that), 5HE purple, 3 HE with his... black?  Switches CD tile, IM40, 4-Lord reducing costs, Hood stealing AP, 3 or 5Lord possibly stealing the right AP, OBW with her purple or her black passive. Mockingbird can passively give you blue, Loki could steal it. Probably a few others.  Keep in mind, most of those are not very reliable.  The most reliable ones other than Vulture were already mentioned.
Arcane_Pozhar	I might put them with 4 Lord, to make even more CD tiles and drop costs.  Won't get me to 2000 in Simulator or anything (maybe in the future with a few more covers), but it will be super fun!
Arcane_Pozhar	Nope, that guy is way older than strange and has always behaved this way.
Arcane_Pozhar	Finally! Two covers I was waiting for at once! | 
Arcane_Pozhar	I do love getting 1000HP, glad you got itvwhen you needed it.
Arcane_Pozhar	Got these yesterday from the Hornhead token from the vault!  This gives my BP his first Black, making him much better if I ever decide to bring him out in PVP, and gets my 5*HE almost ready to use (for fun, on easy fights), he's at 2/1/0 now.  Just want to get the red for him before using him ti splat low level PVP teams, but a third purple or more blue would be cool too, of course.  Also, this is my 1st bonus 5 star ever, despite being a fairly hardcore player for the past 10 months.  So about time!
Arcane_Pozhar	Well, let me put it this way.  I don't know if I've ever lost to Carnage since Medusa became a character.  Maybe, maybe, once or twice, out of many, many matches.  On the other hand, I've had boosted  Antman deal out some serious damage with his yellow, and his blue has taken some strong tiles from me and then whooped me with them.  So Antman is the far bigger threat in my book.
Arcane_Pozhar	I will admit the AI doesn't always play him great, but his yellow is solid, and his blue is great against many special tile makers.  Purple is very hit or miss.
Arcane_Pozhar	Which T-shirt do you want to wear, damage or support?    In general, despite Mordo's buff, i would say Coulson.  He's a great support.
Arcane_Pozhar	I crush Carnage in every fight with my Medusa. Go Antman.  So many players have a Medusa to counter Carnage with.
Arcane_Pozhar	Is there any comment you won't make an excuse for?  And I assure you, it's possible to have them covered and leveled now if you're a dedicated, long term player, even without paying.   I agree Medusa is a little overpowered, but then again, so is Carol, R&G, Gamora, probably Vulture (aka Battery Bird)& Mockingbird, Iceman, Blade (on a red heavy board) and a few others.  Peggy used to feel overpowered, but now Medusa and Carol can both help whittle her down with passives (if you set up Carol's green).  My point is, don't hold your breath waiting for that nerf to come.   If you're going to challenge yourself by avoiding characters you feel are overpowered, that's up to you, but that's not going to help you reach your goal of 2000 in Simulator    Also, it's generally better for the health of the game to add characters who counter certain playstyles, instead of nerfing.  I would not be surprised if we get someone who gets some sort of bonus when an enemy tile is matched away soon, so they can reduce the effectiveness of these teams that make lots of tiles.  Someone besides Medusa, to be clear.
Arcane_Pozhar	Dude, you're so wrong here it's not even funny.  Color coverage, synergy, general effectiveness?  If your three strongest were, say, Mordo, Gwenpool, and Sandman, you would not want them to be out all the time.

UltimateJDB	What's one kink that you have that you've never been able to satisfy? (NSFW) | 
UltimateJDB	This one is a bit weird, even for me. Possession/Mind Control.   It started back when I was just discovering porn. I wound up watching this weird horror movie about parasites that take over the minds of their hosts, causing them to have sex with almost anybody near them.   One scene I vaguely recall is one where an infected woman tries to kiss her uninfected friend. She kisses her back, but she winds up getting infected and they both.... You know.   I think it's the sudden change of mindset or willingness that does it for me.

UltimateJDB	Around Christmas of last year, everything was falling apart. My mom, brother and I were dealing with near homelessness, no money, I couldn't pay for my second semester of college, and my grandfather had just died. Our only way of getting a tiny bit of money was donating plasma at donation clinics. We went in one morning to donate and my mom went first. They had kept her back in the donation area a lot longer than usual, which made me worry. When she finally came out, I knew something was wrong. Her skin was pale, she had trouble focusing on simple things, and her response time to everything was slow. That's when she fell in the floor and began seizing. My brother and I were freaking out in our own respective ways. As my brother nearly began hyperventilating while the staff tended to our mom, this random lady just sat down with him and began talking with him and praying with him. She kept reassuring him that everything would be okay. And honestly, it worked. My brother calmed down enough for me to talk to him and figure out what to do. That's when my mom became responsive again. The EMS team arrived and took her to the hospital and as we headed out we thanked the lady for her kindness and told us that she knew that we just needed a shoulder to lean on. Also my mom is fine now.

UltimateJDB	The problem with that is if you take it too far, you begin to look like an idiot or a jackass. Trust me. I've been down both avenues.
UltimateJDB	Totally agree with you. The best jokes are never planned. You have to see the opportunity and go for it. Just gotta be aware of who you're trying to make laugh.
UltimateJDB	Watching as our nation crawls ever closer to starting a war
UltimateJDB	Stardew Valley. I had never played a Harvest Moon game before and many people compared the two games, so I bought it just cause it was popular. I love the game dearly now and I can't wait to start a new farm.
UltimateJDB	Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words. Oh, the irony. 
UltimateJDB	I was emulating Super Mario World on my PSP and when I got to the first castle, the entire screen turned red. I had no idea what was going on. That's when I heard the game's music and realized it was still going on. I panicked and started pushing buttons in a attempt to fix it, only to wind up beating the Koopaling completely blind. I have never been able to do it since.
UltimateJDB	When I was younger and much more stupid, my grandmother had gotten really sick. I was at staying with her at the time. Well, I was around the age of sexual curiosity. So I was masturbating whenever I had a safe moment. So, one night, I woke up around 2am to have a little fun. It was going smoothly until the light in the hallway cut on. My grandmother had gotten up to use the bathroom. I wasn't worried because I changed the channel and I had an alibi ready. Out of nowhere, I hear my grandmother violently vomiting. I go to see what's wrong and I see she's throwing up blood. Here's the terrible part. I didn't know what to do and young me wanted to finish up, so I stayed by here side until she stopped. Once she did, I told her that we'd call an ambulance in the morning. She went back to sleep and I finished up. But wait. There's more. Turns out, she lost a significant amount of blood. She had lost so much that she needed a blood transfusion. I immediately offered, since I'm O negative. (Or is it positive? Whichever one is the universal donor) She refused since she was a Jehovah's Witnesses and doesn't do that kind of stuff. Which lead to her unfortunate passing. I feel like that the news of her being able to be saved by a transfusion was the universe slapping my in the face and making me fully aware that I had one chance to act and I blew it. To this day, I'm still haunted by the image of her frail body and the fact that if I had acted earlier, instead of being a dick and playing with mine, she might still be here.  TL:DR- My grandmother needed help and I ignored the problem to finish masturbating, which lead to her death.
UltimateJDB	It was an episode of Sonic 06 that Barry left in audio of Jon and Arin making very sexual sounds. Just the way it's sprung up and Barry's text makes it so amazing
UltimateJDB	The pain you feel when something you personally paid for gets broken or stop working. 
UltimateJDB	Same here.
UltimateJDB	I had just gotten in from work. Like I always do, I decided to check up on the chat to make sure the puppies hadn't screwed with the stream in anyway and to deal with any trolls. It was something I had gotten used to. The trolls were annoying at first, but as time went on, they popped up less frequently and didn't stay around long.   I sat down at the computer to just talk with the viewers about my day. It was going over just fine. Someone started asking me about the girl who stopped in earlier during the stream.   "That's my friend, Jennifer. She stops in to check on the puppies during her breaks since she works fifteen minutes away."  I thought that would have been a brief tangent of my daily recap until a new viewer asked another question.  "Yesterday was Sunday. Why didn't you feed the puppies yourself?"   "Jenn and I were getting together with some friends for the afternoon, so we weren't able to do it until later that evening."  I didn't mind the invasive question. It's expected when my life is constantly being streamed. I was about to switch the feed back to the puppies when the same viewer responded with a new message.  "Dude, what are you talking about? Your girlfriend feed the dogs and played with them for about an hour"  I was immediately confused. Jenn had been with me the entire night. There wouldn't have been any way she could have gotten back here without me knowing. I responded and explained how Jennifer was just a friend and had been with me all day.   "If you say so. Just tell her I like the color of her hair"  I just thought this dude was just being weird. Jennifer is a natural blonde. I didn't even worry about it until one of my long time viewers said something to him about it.   He responded,"No. She was a brunette with blue tips."  I immediately froze. I couldn't find words, but the chat exploded. I watched as the conversation quickly turned into a fierce argument. I tried to get control of the situation by asking questions about the mystery woman.  "How many other viewers were watching when you saw her?"  "Just me and three others, but I don't think they were paying much attention."  I believed him. My stream has never had more than 20 viewers on it. I continued with questions.  "What was she wearing?"  "Jeans and a white t-shirt. It had text on it."  My hands are now trembling. There's no possible way. I struggle to ask one final question.  "What were the words on the shirt?"  "Ain't no mountain high enough..."  I couldn't believe it. She was gone. Like, gone gone. I remember the incident. The body was unrecognizable. All they could find to identify her was the shirt I made her. I sat there weeping for everyone to see, simply repeating that one line.   "Ain't no mountain high enough..."  From behind me, I hear a familiar voice.  "Ain't no valley low enough..."  I turn around, still continuing the song.  "Ain't no river wide enough..."  A soft and gentle hand touches my face as I look up. Smiling, Tori embraces me saying only one thing.  "To keep me from getting to you."  We sit there in each other's arms. I didn't care that I had lost her. All that had mattered was that, in that one moment, we were together again.   My first post here in this sub. Feedback is appreciated and forgive my formatting.

UltimateJDB	Why I Fear For My Nephew | I'm an Agnostic Atheist and I'm 19. I still live with my Baptist family. I still let them believe I'm a Christian because I don't have the heart to tell my mother and I can't have my family hating me until I'm on my own feet. So I still go to religious events at my church, including Vacation Bible School. It's essentially a week where the church holds Bible study every night, but they have lessons for the kids. I never minded the lessons and their teachings until last night. My 2 year old nephew was there, being hilarious as usual. My aunt wanted him to do something in the wrap up portion of the night. They brought him up in front of the crowd and had him say,"God is love." It didn't really bother me until my aunt said,"It's never too early to start teaching them the word of God." I immediately knew that he was doomed to to have their beliefs shoved down his throat. There's not much I can do because he's not my son. I don't have the right to go against my sister. All I can do is be there for him if he ever decides to leave the church like I plan on doing.   Rant over. Thanks for your time.

AhsokaRey1138	Clinton was completely out of touch with the average American and came off as an elitist. 
AhsokaRey1138	What's the best NSFW moment in the Bible? | 
AhsokaRey1138	One of the best ones. That's like beyond even game of thrones in terms of fucked-upery!

AhsokaRey1138	Beautiful weed should be smoked free and open. 
AhsokaRey1138	Yeah watching star wars films while living in the Star Wars universe! 
AhsokaRey1138	Wow wtf 
AhsokaRey1138	Very few Christians have actually read the entire thing and and even fewer understsnd what it actually says and meant at the time it was written. 
AhsokaRey1138	The bible has always been in my life so I can't point to moment it changed my life. 
AhsokaRey1138	Misread that shit may have been 
AhsokaRey1138	He has billions of dollars that he should give away to the poor. 
AhsokaRey1138	Watching a new star wars film every single day. 
AhsokaRey1138	Yes very normal but wait until you are 18 to have sex with any of them. 
AhsokaRey1138	What book changed your life? | 
AhsokaRey1138	So who would you pick? 
AhsokaRey1138	Also non religious male from Ohio in the usa.  I just don't think animals have the understanding of their existance like humans do. They live to just survive and humans have evolved past that. 
AhsokaRey1138	George RR Martans Harry Potter rewrite would be cool. 
AhsokaRey1138	Other than the make him scream part I honestly had no issue with any of it. 
AhsokaRey1138	It's not insensitive just factually incorrect. 
AhsokaRey1138	Yes i dont see why not. 
AhsokaRey1138	What makes an animals life more important than bacteria? Bacteria is also life and is just trying to survive just like animals. 
AhsokaRey1138	Doesn't make it a good idea to have sex with adults as a minor. 
AhsokaRey1138	But to prevent disease you have to murder life to do it. 
AhsokaRey1138	So it's okay to murder life just to save your own? 
AhsokaRey1138	I can say what I really think. I have social anxiety to the extreme in real life
AhsokaRey1138	Dish washer 
AhsokaRey1138	He disrespects others. Bullies get bullied.

AhsokaRey1138	Excellent choice 
AhsokaRey1138	I have many times. Not for me.  Edit: I love how people get offended by MY lifestyle choices and downvote me. 
AhsokaRey1138	Who you thinking? 
AhsokaRey1138	Eww monogamy how boring. 
AhsokaRey1138	Trump being elected. 
AhsokaRey1138	No if aliens capable of space travel were to land on earth they could build something a lot more impressive.  Humans built those things. 
AhsokaRey1138	So who would you pick? 
AhsokaRey1138	How morbid. 
AhsokaRey1138	If you had to watch your SO have sex with any celebrity who would it be? |

AhsokaRey1138	Yes you can change it up in the bedroom! 
AhsokaRey1138	He's a rich idiot not a nazi. 
AhsokaRey1138	Why are vegan against eating animals but okay with eating plants, murdering life by taking anti biotics and washing their hands? | 
AhsokaRey1138	What's your favorite gender? | 
AhsokaRey1138	Overcrowding seems to be the real issue from what I've seen. There might be enough land for everyone if we made better use of the earth. 
AhsokaRey1138	OMFG yes please. The movie would be beautiful. 
AhsokaRey1138	Spitting all over the place. 
AhsokaRey1138	If you could replace Jar Jar Binks with any other fictional character in The Phantom Menace who would you replace him with? | 
AhsokaRey1138	That's where the theory comes from. All of television is inside this boys mind with some exceptions. 
AhsokaRey1138	No one can kill a jedi! 
AhsokaRey1138	Because we have new star wars movies every year. That alone is enough to make life worth living. 
AhsokaRey1138	I don't find then particularly attractive. 
AhsokaRey1138	Ps3
AhsokaRey1138	Fascinating I love it. 
AhsokaRey1138	Well then you are lost. 
AhsokaRey1138	Banning AI research when one of them tries to take over the world literally. 
AhsokaRey1138	The one where all of television is actually inside the mind of am autistic child. 
AhsokaRey1138	HK shoots maul from behind on tatooine. Changes everything. 
AhsokaRey1138	How could you do this? 
AhsokaRey1138	Would Qui Gon be his master? 
AhsokaRey1138	I'm going with star wars a new hope.  
AhsokaRey1138	Watch star wars 
AhsokaRey1138	If he was 18 which is an adult, this would feel different. Still horrific but different. 
AhsokaRey1138	Just run away lol
AhsokaRey1138	Tell that to the citizen there who are suffering. 
AhsokaRey1138	If you made a joke about my mother when she had cancer I might have broke your neck. 
AhsokaRey1138	Don't sniff then. 
AhsokaRey1138	I'm done with Christmas.
AhsokaRey1138	Hard for it to be private when the religion states you must spread the good news. 
AhsokaRey1138	Your dislike of the word triggered triggers me. 
AhsokaRey1138	Nobody was popular in my high school. The music and theater  kids basiclly ran things. 
AhsokaRey1138	I mean there were assholes and drama but nobody was specifically more popular. Maybe more outgoing and noticed due to that. 
AhsokaRey1138	I'm just beyond triggered at this point. I want to blow up a planet. 
AhsokaRey1138	Their health 
AhsokaRey1138	In second grade for basketball and bowling. 
AhsokaRey1138	What's a view you strongly disagree with but still respect greatly? | 
AhsokaRey1138	*Nobody with common sense cares if you are offended. 
AhsokaRey1138	Living alone is amazing. 
AhsokaRey1138	That's horrible. People have no right to put their hands on you. 
AhsokaRey1138	I understand. I always try my hardest to not make those kinds of noises. Thanks to reddit I learned this was a huge annoyance for people. 
AhsokaRey1138	Home Alone. If Kevin was on Facebook or had texting things would have gone a lot differently. 
AhsokaRey1138	Who cares if someone has had sex or not. 
AhsokaRey1138	Aww thanks but no need. 
AhsokaRey1138	If they also believe that society should care for the child after they are born I respect their views. It feels like a lot of anti abortion people are more pro birth than pro life. 
AhsokaRey1138	My dad has a dog and my girl friend has rats. They both clean up after them I won't. 
AhsokaRey1138	It's a joke for me to be called that. 
AhsokaRey1138	Just tell her you disagree with her and continue loving her. Changing older people's mind is more impossible than time travel. 
AhsokaRey1138	I keep out of politics because I'm anti confrontational. 
AhsokaRey1138	When she gave me weed and agreed to watch star wars with and loved it. 
AhsokaRey1138	I realized way too late that the women who would grab my butt in high school as a joke were actually bullying me. I wish I had done something about it because they most likely went on to believe what they did was okay. 
AhsokaRey1138	I'm sorry to hear that. I know how that is. People love making fun of my coprophobia. 
AhsokaRey1138	I'm sex positive and believe in people having all the fun safe sex they want. That being said you never know who has stds so the social conservative and prudes having stds on their side gives them a good argument for sexual purity.

AhsokaRey1138	What's a trigger you have that most people do not take seriously? | 
AhsokaRey1138	You know you exist in this world with other people. You have to be careful how to explain things. I wasn't the only one who interpreted your words in the way I did.

CaniborrowaThrillho	[TOMT] (Youtube Video) Aged a thousand years sketch | It was a really dumb comedy sketch with two guys. One had a beard and says "oh no, I've aged a thousand years and I don't know why!". Then he calls in a doctor, repeats the same line, they repeat back and forth etc. It was REALLY cheesy. Probably 2007-2008ish.

CaniborrowaThrillho	Have an older sister. She'd offer to run or race in a circle, then push me over and say "oh no Thrillho, did you fall down?!"... Over and over. I was not a bright lad.
CaniborrowaThrillho	Why am I so fat?
CaniborrowaThrillho	My teeth keep falling out
CaniborrowaThrillho	One question. Do you have a note?

CaniborrowaThrillho	[TOMT] [MUSIC VIDEO] | First off, I had the flu when I saw this video, and it's very possible it was a fever dream. But it would have been around 12-15 years ago.   I believe it was a rock song, but can't really remember what style. I remember a woman, I think in a white dress. Very harsh lighting. And near the end there was a brownish red winged gargoyle creature in a doorway, backlit so it was mostly a silhouette, but you could see hair and veins on its wings.   That's all that I can recall, again, it could very well be a fever dream. 
CaniborrowaThrillho	Nah, it's Hatchetface from Crybaby

Slumped__	Yeah, there is :) FL Studio Demo
Slumped__	Mac Version is fuckin' great | Been a longtime user of FL. Just bought a new Mac, and the Alpha version of Signature Edition runs perfectly. Just for some context, I spent 2 straight days making a 70 layer Dubstep track, and no problems, so far (other than one crash. Just save your work and you're golden).
Slumped__	1. i absolutely hate how for like a week or two at a time, agar.io will start randomly mouse lagging. i move my mouse up and it takes a second or two for my cell to actually start flippin' moving in that direction. I'll try quickly changing direction and splitting for someone, but the mouse lag causes me to miss the other player. i know other people are experiencing this garbage, too.  2. all teams are obnoxious. this includes all those asian teams that take over an entire server at like 2am (also includes mk clan). there is no skill in splitting 5 times across the map for a cell that has only 10 mass. what i've learned is to go to https://coolsymbol.com/cool-fancy-text-generator.html and make a fake clan name and play with that, so they will team with you. once they give you all the mass, kill them all!  3. all the *fake* youtuber names! i always see (and i know you do, too) players with the name "wun wun" or "smash", and i always shake my head in disgust. what is the point? nobody is going to believe that shit!  4. people who put "pro" or "team please" or "w=team" in their name. just stop, bud. players who have names like these are usually level 1-10 who think they're the shit because they've been playing for 3 days. if you're lookin' for easy targets in agar.io, search for players with names like these, and you're golden!  5. agar.io youtube videos are literal trash. like: wow, buddy! :D nice job! you joined an agar.io clan and bought sony vegas?! that is some pure talent, right there! you definitely deserve subscribers out the fuckin' wazoo!!!  6. them little buggers who shoot viruses at you. you all know what i'm talking about. they have like 100 mass, and once they finally manage to shoot the virus at you, they're too small to even eat a piece of you. i'll usually split for them, just as a little bit of a "fuck you".  7. "the game is running slow. please try closing some tabs that may be running in the background". those of you who like to listen to music in the background on another tab will definitely know this message. if you're in-game and check the tab for half a second, this message will pop up. it doesn't do anything, but for some reason it bothers the hell outta me.
Slumped__	Made a mistake | It wasn't too big of a mistake, but it was a mistake. I bought Reaper in the hopes of having a program similar to FL Studio. Boy was I wrong. It is literal garbage for making electronic music. No wonder I'd never heard of it until this morning.
Slumped__	get your shit together | [removed]
Slumped__	Looking for 1P-LSD | I'm looking for a 1P-LSD vendor who has decent prices and ships out of the USA.  Anyone know of any?  Thanks!
Slumped__	Requests a password. Any way to fix this?
Slumped__	do some real drugs, kid
Slumped__	don't do coke = no more paranoia
Slumped__	he's a man whore
Slumped__	No. They assume most people won't be retarded enough to actually do it.
Slumped__	The sounds they would make would be of a frequency that humans cannot hear.
Slumped__	Weed's no big deal

Slumped__	Buying Off the Darknet: Good Idea? | [removed]
Slumped__	my name is s c a l e n e | i vibe https://soundcloud.com/s-c-a-l-e-n-e
Slumped__	I'd recommend listening to binaural beats. They put you in a state of mind that makes you super relaxed, with no thought-clutter in your mind. Just lay down on your bed with the lights off, put on some good over-ear headphones, and close your eyes. :)
Slumped__	Psychedelics aren't generally great for listening to rap, unfortunately. I tried once, and it gave me a bad trip. The snares in the beat were scary!  Anyways, I'd recommend MDMA.
Slumped__	sell it to them, then xD
Slumped__	Just wait 'til you can find some more, or buy some at the concert. Small doses of MDMA aren't worth it.
Slumped__	Melatonin fucked my sleep schedule so bad.
Slumped__	Fuck benzos
Slumped__	Hold on just a quick minute... They want to say the coffee in Italy sucked? That's the coffee capital of the world.  Anyways, I'd recommend finding a pasttime. Mine is producing music. Sometimes even doing your hobby while high is even more fun than doing it sober! It is good, though, to simply find an enjoyable, and semi-productive hobby. Doesn't matter what it is. Just as long as you get something out of it, and have to work at least a little for it.  Hope this helped! :)
Slumped__	Sell it to some junkie.
Slumped__	McDonald's chicken nuggets
Slumped__	Mental addiction is possible with anything. Like it or not, it's possible to become mentally addicted to weed. This may unfortunately be you.  I wish you the best on getting your sleep schedule back, brother! :)
Slumped__	Why else would he be selling drugs? To "share the experience" with other people? Yeah right. Get realistic, my man.
Slumped__	Not Adderall, but Wellbutrin most likely
Slumped__	We're here to talk about drugs in general. Not glorify them. Be realistic
Slumped__	Air in lungs = not harmful  Anything else in lungs = harmful
Slumped__	It's both an experience and a way to make money. Just like any other drug :)
Slumped__	Had a horrible time with Weed, DXM, and 3 shots of Fireball all at once. I don't remember shit. All I remember is laying down and waking up at 7pm, thinking it was 7am, and time to go to work.  Don't do it again. It can fuck you, depending on dosage.
Slumped__	Simple answer is no
Slumped__	Crossfading with DXM is a no-go.
Slumped__	A common saying in the drug world, which is said by many past addicts I have spoken to:  "There is no such thing as a functioning addict"
Slumped__	No need to be accurate on this one. It's as easy as 1-2-3. As a 4 year old knows it's bad to scream at the top of their lungs, yet does it anyways - we inhale things we know are harmful into our lungs.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out. Perhaps we should get people on here who can ask some more stimulating questions.
Slumped__	One thing is that shrooms always keep me awake. really odd, but they have a stimulating effect on me
Slumped__	Go ahead and think that all you want, but the effects on the mind are clearly shown in the tweakers living in most likely the very patch of woods your house is next to. They're everywhere, and they're insane. Trust me on this one. Meth is a nogo
Slumped__	Here are the big 3 nonos of the drug world:  * Meth * Heroin * Crack
Slumped__	Shooting up anything is retarded
Slumped__	You should be a comedian
Slumped__	Shrooms
Slumped__	Tiny
Slumped__	Do it again, and you'll probably shed a new light
Slumped__	Assuming you're talking about weed. Hate to break it to you, but it won't give you an out of body experience. It's definitely noticeable, though.
Slumped__	Goodnight :)
Slumped__	Drugs and college are like beans and rice
Slumped__	Eat 2 hours prior. If you're hungry, you can eat after about 2 hours of taking it. Have fun, bro. DXM is great
Slumped__	4-AcO-DMT
Slumped__	Just remember that anything you see that is odd, is not real. If you mention, say, "That tree is bending," it'd obviously be a dead giveaway. Just keep your cool
Slumped__	Shrooms is all I need
Slumped__	Tweakers are unpredictable 
Slumped__	Weed is shit. Makes me paranoid.
Slumped__	Wellbutrin
Slumped__	Avoiding becoming an addicted, insane, tweaking ass retard, by not doing those drugs wouldn't really classify someone as a "pu$$y ni🅱🅱a"
Slumped__	Once, I was raped by a raccoon after buying a microgram of weed. Pretty gnarly
Slumped__	Now, this man understands
Slumped__	I don't care who I offend. get 'em out

Slumped__	This actually has already happened to me, due to my many uses of RCs. It's all good, though, since I have taught myself how to type pretty quickly with my two paws.
Slumped__	New Drug?! | [removed]
Slumped__	New RC on the market | [removed]
Slumped__	You can buy Peyote cactus seeds for a much cheaper price online on Shamanic Extracts (Starting at $8 for 10). I wouldn't recommend buying a 2 inch cactus for $50, that's too much. I'd recommend simply growing it yourself. It's pretty easy, as cacti don't need much water to grow and survive.  Hope this helped!  *Good luck!* :)
Slumped__	Moderate use of alcohol is good. I know plenty of people who experiment with new shots and mixtures of hard liquor, but never get wasted. It's always nice to have a bit of alcohol from time to time, nothing to be ashamed of! :)
Slumped__	My favorite drug experience oddly enough was on DXM. It can go both ways, though.
Slumped__	Sleep, bud. Sleep
Slumped__	Damn. The euphoria really got to you. lol
Slumped__	Definitely don't use again. You don't want to once again experience that downward spiral in your life.   Just remember: There is no such thing as a functioning addict.
Slumped__	I've had it take up to 3 hours before. It will start to slowly creep up on you, and before you know it, you're baked.   But to answer your question, the threshold can be anywhere from 1-3 hours.
Slumped__	Future, is that you?
Slumped__	120mg 4-AcO-DMT | Okay, so I had this experience about a month ago, but I feel like something has been keeping me from actually telling you guys about it.  I took 20mg of 4-AcO-DMT one night ('round 9pm). It was on a full stomach, so it was taking a bit longer than usual. I continued waiting until about an hour has passed, but still felt nothing. I soon decided that since I had a full stomach, I would need to take more to feel the effects, In which I decided to dose 100mg more of the drug.  LET ME TELL YOU: In the beginning, it was amazing. I felt extreme euphoria, the visuals were great, and things felt and sounded cool. It soon got late, and I was beginning to get a extreme sense of anxiety, so I decided it'd be a good idea to go to sleep. I headed to bed, but couldn't sleep, so I decided to watch something on my phone. I pulled up a YouTube video about trees or some shit, but I couldn't watch it. The video was going from high pitched to low pitched, then would play in reverse. It didn't make any sense, so I decided to just try to go to sleep. *Didn't work*. My mind was way too overstimulated to ever fall asleep, so I simply laid there. Tossing and turning, the anxiety was killing me, so I grabbed the first thing I associated with killing anxiety and stress: my vape (also known as a douche flute). I was tossing and turning, chain vaping, and scratching at my face, because it felt like there were zits and scabs all over it (imagine a longtime meth user's face. *Yup*, it felt like that). This continued for another 3 hours, until 2:52AM (when I checked the time on my phone). 2:52AM didn't feel like 2:52AM. It didn't feel like there was only a minute to go until 2:53AM. It felt like an eternity. A very dark, depressed eternity. My ego died at 2:52AM. I forgot about everything in my life. I didn't know who I was, where I was, or what life is. Then, things started coming back to me. First was the fact that life exists. I started grasping what life is. I soon realized that we live to die, which depressed me. I began contemplating breaking through my neighbors' homes to find a gun, to kill myself. I was in this mindset as I began remembering my name. I began with my first name, then middle, then last. I said my name aloud, proud that I had accomplished such a feat. Then, I moved onto remembering what day it was, what I'd have to do the next day. Everything started coming together again. I was coming down. I still had a tremendous amount of anxiety, but it was depleting. I was down by 5AM, but still felt the effects for about 3 days after.  I am down from the experience. On my way out, I brought some things down with me, as well as left some things behind. My life is better. Somehow quite a bit of my flaws are gone. I am most definitely a changed human. I have a different mindset, and am more open to new things. I used to be extremely conservative and closed minded, but am now an open minded person.  The hours of horror, pain, and fear, that felt like days, in which I went through, were extremely worth it. I have been absolutely changed by my bad trip with 4-AcO-DMT, so I'd like to say, "Thank you!" I'd also like to say: "*Don't fucking do this. It can be dangerous. I was lucky to have come back in the state that I am. I know people who have lost their minds to things like this.*"  Overall, I wouldn't do such a high dosage ever again. I'll stick with 30-60mg, and you should too.

Slumped__	Fuck Salvia | Aight, so I ordered some Salvia 10x offline (it's legal in my state).  Today it came in the mail, so the first thing I did was drive to the park and pack a small bowl. I smoked the bowl and felt literally nothing, so I smoked 2 more bowls of it.  BAM. I was there. I wasn't scared or anxious, but I did feel like I did feel like I was melting into the seat of my car. Not only that, but I felt like there was a large piece of plastic going through my torso, because I was unable to move it. The same thing with my legs. On top of all this, I was faced with such a weird feeling that I can't even describe. It is not a fun feeling. The trip only lasted 2-3 minutes. Once it was over, I threw the rest of the Salvia away.  Fuck Salvia. Don't fuck with that shit. If you want a good psychedelic experience, do shrooms or something.
Slumped__	Trust me. This was a shitty feeling
Slumped__	Watch out | 
Slumped__	Microdosing 4-AcO-DMT | Been microdosing 10mg every once in a while for a bit.  Makes me able to focus and think super well, but not be extremely hyper. I'm chill, but not sleepy.  Thoughts? Is this a bad idea?
Slumped__	Tolerance? | I took 60mg 4-AcO-DMT and had a great trip. Awesome visuals, but nothing too intense.  I gave a buddy of mine 30mg and he said he tripped literal balls. Harder than he's ever tripped before (other than DMT).  I've taken 4-AcO-DMT only twice before. One of those doses being around 100mg (never doing that again. Had an ego death while moving around restlessly in my bed)  Do I have a tolerance or something?
Slumped__	What is 4-AcO-DPT like? | [removed]
Slumped__	What is 4-AcO-DPT like? | I'd just like a gist of what 4-AcO-DPT is like, and what drugs it's similar to (in high doses).  I'm hoping it's similar to DPT, because that's similar to DMT. I'm looking for a gnarly experience.  I usually wouldn't make a post like this, but I couldn't find anything online about it. It has little history of human consumption.  Please don't mistake what I'm asking about for 4-AcO-DMT. I know what that's like (awesome). I'm asking about 4-AcO-DPT.  Thanks in advance!
Slumped__	Need 5-MEO-DMT | I'm looking to buy 5-MEO-DMT. I want to spend no more than $30, and I'd like to buy a small amount.  Anyone know of a good and trustworthy source in which to buy it?
Slumped__	It's no business, bud. I'm just hooking my friends up with some free dank homegrown
Slumped__	Shipping weed | I've been shipping weed around Washington, Oregon, and California for a while, now. It's legal in all those states, but the USPS is a federal business, meaning it is still illegal.  To be extra careful, I've been quadra-packing the weed, as well as smell proofing it. I also don't add any return address.  Am I doing anything wrong? Any tips?
Slumped__	Music is a totally different experience while tripping. Nearly all music is great while on a trip. I'm just asking what songs are the best to trip to.

Slumped__	I'll be selling 4-AcO-DMT, DPT, 4-AcO-DPT, 5-MEO-MiPT, and 4-AcO-MET. I'll also be accepting requests for new chemicals to be sold. If I get enough requests, I'll look into it.
Slumped__	As others have said: **It's too good to be true.**  Don't buy it. I'd really only recommend BCL Supply. They're extremely trustworthy. They always send extra.

mtra_	Thanks for the suggestion, listening now..Pretty much what i'm looking for !

mtra_	Need help with planning our Spain trip in June | Hi friends, it will be my fiance and I's first time visiting Europe and was hoping you guys could give us a hand in finalizing our itinerary.      Here's what we're thinking:    10-Day Greek Island Tour with Topdeck (Athens, Paros, Mykonos & Santorini)      2-Days in Barcelona    3-Days in Ibiza      3-Days in Valencia     2-Days in San Sebastian    My question is - does our Spain trip seem a bit too rushed? Are we trying to see too many things? And since we're already doing the Greek Islands maybe we should remove San Sebastian (one too many mediterranean spots)?    If you guys suggest other places in Spain we would love to know why! Thanks 
mtra_	haha so true.  Although if we're going by his previous sets, when he asks the crowd if they're ready for some serious uplifting it's generally a sign that his set will be largely trance.

mtra_	I train Muay Thai Kickboxing high every so often, it definitely enhances my training in alot of ways including cardio (surprisingly) as well being more in tune with the physical mechanics of my body. It seems to also put me in a flow state.

mtra_	Selling: 2x Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas Tix + 2x Linq Shuttle Passes (negotiable) | Hi friends,   Thought I might try my luck selling in here incase anyone is looking to go this year.      2x EDC LAS VEGAS Tickets June 16th, 2017      **$530 AUD ea or $1060 AUD for both**   Originally Paid $1140 for both (this includes the Las Vegas Entertainment Tax - 9% and Service Charge)      Also selling 2x Linq Shuttle Passes   **$120 AUD ea for $240 AUD for both**    Meet up with Cash Preferred (Sydney CBD, West or Inner West area preferred)   Will provide:   - A copy fo the order receipt   - Photocopy of my ID and card used to purchase which you can show at Will Call Box Office for pick up.    PM  
mtra_	+1 for Chatkazz!!
mtra_	Section 10 essentially is a title given to a conviction you were found guilty of, but the court dismissed all charges and therefore, there is no criminal record under your name. It's usually given to you when it's a minor offence and/or your first.
mtra_	Selling 2x EDC Las Vegas 3 Day tix + 2x Linq shuttle passes | EDC LAS VEGAS    Selling just below face value (**$820 USD for both**) Price includes Las Vegas Entertainment Tax and Service Charge     Also selling 2x Linq Shuttle Passes  (**$180 USD for both**)   Price includes Las Vegas Entertainment Tax and Service Charge      **TOTAL PRICE = $1000 USD**   **No single ticket purchases.. must buy both tix + shuttle passes together as I've been advised by Insomniac that only one recipient can pick up the tickets and shuttle passes. (prices negotiable)**  Paypal payment   Will provide the email of the order, a photocopy of my ID and card used to purchase which you can show at Will Call Box Office for pick up.  hit me up!
mtra_	Pretty sure. This is from Front Gate's email:    Will Call Procedure   The person picking up the wristband(s) will need to bring the following::      - His/Her OWN ID   - A copy of the original purchaser’s photo ID.   - A copy of the original purchaser’s credit card (front and back) with the last 4 digits visible. 
mtra_	Question about selling tickets individually | Hi I hope someone could answer this for me.    I purchased 2x GA tickets for EDC LV as well as 2x Shuttle Passes and looking to sell it all.    If I have a seller that only wants to buy 1 ticket,  I supply them with a photocopy my ID and credit card so they may pick up the 1 ticket at Will Call....Would another person be able to pick up the other ticket and/or shuttle pass(given that I also supply that person with my ID and credit card)?  Or will I need to sell both tickets and shuttle passes together since they were purchased as one order?  Sorry hope that makes sense.
mtra_	Yeah pretty much...   They responded by asking for additional information about the charge, but I chose not to reply in fear it would make things worse. And so they now have my ESTA application number via the email query, I suspect there's a 50/50 chance I will be flagged upon entry.    Can never know for sure, but the last thing I want is to be sent home after a long flight, and end up with a record on my passport that'll effect my future travels :'(
mtra_	Silly me I never checked the sidebar! Much appreciated    Yeah, it's a real bummer..hopefully, I'll get to experience EDC next year.
mtra_	Hey mate, yeah basically I got a little too paranoid and revealed to the US customs about my section 10(which in Australia is not a criminal charge) by emailing them a question. In fear of being denied entry, I opted to not take the risk and cancel my trip :'(. Had I not emailed them giving them my ESTA application no. I'd most likely be traveling to the US.     To put simply, if you applied for ESTA and have a section 10 then you might be sweet given that you don't disclose it. If you have a criminal record of any sort, they will know and you might need to look into getting a VISA Waiver application like me which can take up to 6 months.    EDIT: Take my advice with a grain of salt, there's still a chance you will get caught.
mtra_	How do I sell my EDC Tickets + shuttle Passes? | Hi friends,  I'm from Australia. I've purchased 2 x EDC tickets + Shuttle Passes.  As heartbreaking as it may be, we will not be able to attend this year due to a delay in our VISA application :'(  I was wondering if you guys could help me out – where or how do I go about selling my tickets + shuttle passes?  As I can recall, we had to enter in our names for each of the tickets - is there a way to transfer the names to someone elses?  Lastly, if I successfully sell our tickets + Shuttle passes, how will the recipient go about picking up the tickets in Vegas?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.. we are absolutely devastated that we will be missing out as we were really looking forward to this trip T_T fingers crossed EDC comes back next year.  Much appreciated
mtra_	Linq 
mtra_	Thanks for the tip mate! I'll look into emailing them

mtra_	Apart from the vivid dreams (which is probably the most noticeable effects) I found it to be very subtle in terms of cognitive benefits. I've read that the dosage as well as the length in which you take Alpha brain varies. Seeing as it costs almost 50 AUD for 30 caps I opted out after the first bottle.   My current stack for focus and mental clarity is Caffeine + L-theanine + Alpha GPC. Works a helluva lot better than Alpha Brain for me, and much cheaper.   Nootropics affects everyone differently, so have a read on /r/nootropics and /r/stackadvice before you take anything
mtra_	Sorry I don't know any shops in Sydney, but it might be cheaper to search via /r/nootropics and then buying the supplements online via iherb.com. If you haven't already, take a look at the ingredients in Onnit's Alpha Brain and go from there. I've taken a bottle of Alpha Brain a while back and it 100% gives you super vivid dreams. Just hella expensive
mtra_	HEAD MOOMENT!!

mtra_	I did a single session in the 2-hour intermediate class  at Tiger Muay Thai – Overall a great experience, from memory the class went something like:   - Warm up (running around the gym and shadow boxing)   - Clinch work with a partner   - 4 1:1 rounds of pad work with a trainer (everyone gets their own TMT trainer)   - 3 rounds on the heavy bag   - Clinch sparring with everyone in the class and with the trainers      Like you, I train leisurely and looked to fit a session in between our busy holiday itinerary. By all means, you should experience this if you can! The intensity was nothing out of the ordinary, but training for 2 hours in hot and humid weather makes a big difference, I recommend you try and attend the morning class when it's still a little cool.

mtra_	ECO - If I Survive (Ill Worship The Moon) | 
tallturd	What's one thing about yourself you'd be willing to tell a complete stranger, but not anybody you know? | 
tallturd	Save your money. Housing is EXPENSIVE.
tallturd	I honestly wish I could hug you. If you happen to live in the US - Seattle area, PM me. 
tallturd	Start writing fiction.
tallturd	I hope it gets better. Everyone has their own life; some have it better than others. For those who go through struggles, come out stronger than the rest. 
tallturd	I feel your pain.
tallturd	I don't do any of it. Honey, meat, seafood, etc. if someone who claims to be vegan eats oysters or crickets, they're not vegan.  I don't judge others for it, I just don't do it myself. There's details such as sugars and other things that I don't try too hard to avoid because it's near impossible and so minuscule, but there's no intentional animal products in said product.
tallturd	I'm married. I'd like to say that in the earlier years of a relationship things are burning. Like a bonfire, it's slowly withers down to just an ember. You must add to the fire to keep it hot. It doesn't have to burn as high and mighty as it once did, but it has to exist. Once it's out, it's cold. And when it's cold, it's going to be a lot harder, if not impossible, to start it again.  You know, people get comfortable. Just because he isn't always showing affection and love, doesn't mean he doesn't feel it. Reflect on things that you may have mentioned that annoy you. Did he make an effort to fix them?  Example: I always left my shoes in the kitchen and not by the front door. My wife HATES it. But it's a strong habit (idk why). Although I didn't immediately fix the problem, I still would remember (out of love) to leave them at the door every now and again. I got better at it, but I still do roughly 20% of the time.  When relationships age, you can't compare them to the beginning, you have to know that you are with/around the same person every day. It's like when you buy a new car: you treat it like a precious diamond, but after a while you start eating food in it, leaving trash on the floor, smoking, etc...  You still love the car, you've just outgrown the honeymoon phase. If you cared, you'd change the oil, wash it every now and again, even fix small damages. That's how it is.  My point is: look for the little things. He may still love you. I'm no professional, and I may be wrong since I am in no way involved in your relationship, but just keep an eye out.  There also could be a chance that he is truly depressed. If he is, he won't likely say it outright. If you confront him about his problem straight up, he may feel threatened or insulted. Ease your way in.   All in all. I hope it all works out for you and I hope you both end up happy and healthy regardless of the outcome. 
tallturd	I hope you can still manage to obtain a sex life. I couldn't imagine, but I can empathize.
tallturd	I remember the words from a sage:  *There is no lower standard than liking someone that doesn't like you back. Them liking you should be their most attractive quality.*  It's actually a LPT I saw today but maybe it will bring you some enlightenment. 😀
tallturd	Same
tallturd	TRUST NO ONE
tallturd	It'll come. You just have to remember that you have decades ahead of you. Think of all of life's experiences.   To feel motivated, try asking seniors about their life experiences, ask them about their siblings and what they've done. It will make you want to live yours the same.
tallturd	I'm happy if it helped you get it out  in the open. Sometimes it'll make people feel better.   Get well, commenter.
tallturd	I hope you never do. I wish the best for you and hope that your life, or whatever causes those thoughts, gets better and you happily make it through the remainder of your life. ❤️
tallturd	Now you have 1!
tallturd	Have you ever masturbated and then ate finger-food afterwards without washing your hands?
tallturd	You need to file a restraining order
tallturd	You got to do it for yours, and other's sake.
tallturd	I'm so sorry.  Jk ily 
tallturd	Wait, doesn't everyone?
tallturd	Do you orgasm to it?
tallturd	She's obviously a scumbag. I'd say to just ignore her/tell her off the best you can and let her deal with her own problems. She can't seem to be single, and craves attention from anyone who can give it to her. When no one else does, she comes back to you.  Don't let this witch manipulate you!
tallturd	May you be blessed with good fiber and 1 wipe.
tallturd	You don't have to be interesting. As long as you're genuine, that's all I care about. I'd totally be your friend, just message me.
tallturd	As a father, I can sympathize. Your hormones could be all over the place. It's different with each child, so you can never expect how your pregnancy goes.   You have a midwife so I can imagine you already know (bless you for not getting an ob/gyn) but do not take drugs. Look up natural herbs such as St. John's wurt (sp?) and ashwaganda (sp?).  I hope it all improves and I heavily insist that you talk to your husband. I hope it all gets better for you and congratulations on the new little one.
tallturd	To each their own, my friend.
tallturd	That would be terrible
tallturd	Sounds like my in-laws; passive-aggressive and sweeps any problem under the rug.
tallturd	That's fucking dope!
tallturd	Imagination.
tallturd	Nothing wrong with that. Feet are kinda gross, so having well manicured feet is a nice plus.
tallturd	Look for asexual groups with people of your same taste. Eventually you'll find someone who you'll probably want to bone sometime before you're both at the altar, until then, find mutuals.
tallturd	Happens to everyone. You'll be alright.
tallturd	Get a dog!
tallturd	Tell them while wielding one of your swords.
tallturd	I feel you. Anytime I encounter someone struggling with personal isssues, I always do what I can to help. ❤️
tallturd	As long as their eyes are on the road.
tallturd	Wtf
tallturd	Even the one about the guy with hemorrhoids?
tallturd	Absolutely. But you may not be able to let them leave.
tallturd	People are flakes. Seek new friends who value you and your time. I know for an absolute fact that it's harder than it sounds, trust me, but it will come in due time. If you do cut them off, and if they're your real friends - they'll reach out to you. That's when you should tell them why.  I hope it works out for you!
tallturd	Take a trip to Indonesia.
tallturd	THANKS MR. SKELTAL
tallturd	Care to contribute?
tallturd	Have you tried daring things? Go skydiving, bungee jumping, etc
tallturd	Try to eat more mushrooms. Vitamin D deficiency can cause sudden lethargy and angst.   
tallturd	Remember that a lifetime friendship is more valuable than a piece. Honor your friend, your feelings will pass. There's nothing wrong with attraction, just don't act on it.
tallturd	As much as people like a funny one, they like genuineness more. Be yourself. Even if you have unpopular opinions (as long as they're not too invasive) they will respect you for it and see you more as an individual.
tallturd	Move to Seattle. No one here has a sexuality or gender. No judgement at all.
tallturd	Have you considered a productive hobby? 
tallturd	That's all ya got?
tallturd	I feel like what makes any *smart* person *stupid* is the lack of common sense.  Use a turn signal.  Be aware of your surroundings.  Green means go, red means stop.  Etc 
tallturd	If you don't eat, you'll lose weight but in an unhealthy way. I understand you don't have an appetite, but try to satisfy your needs with small portioned Frits and veggies. Have a banana in the AM, carrots and such for lunch, and maybe a small dinner. You will lose a great amount of weight and your body won't punish you for it.
tallturd	Do you sniff your own farts? Do you like the smell of Indian food? Did you used to think your cousin was hot?   Stop holding back. WE WILL FIND OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
tallturd	Keep up?
tallturd	I still am not judging.
tallturd	Eh I don't judge. If commenter has oral herpes, his wife already does. But it's likely they both had it prior to engagement. 
tallturd	If you gotta succ, ya gotta succ. Totally get it. No judgement here, fam.
Ilandar	And while we're at it...   #STOP USING 7 YEAR OLD TORRENT CLIENTS 
Ilandar	Wow, nice overreaction. I was explaining why you're being downvoted - I never gave my personal opinion.

Ilandar	RARBG, 1337x, the KAT site run by former KAT staffers (katcr.co), 토렌트킴, RuTracker...  Or direct download sites like IGG-Games, /r/megalinks or tools like Deezloader...  There are so many better options, I don't understand why people continue to use such an unfriendly, archaic site filled with fake uploads. Probably the same idiots who use a 7 year old version of µTorrent.
Ilandar	That hasn't stopped them yet! Even the sub-60 group had some last time I ran. 
Ilandar	토렌트킴 (Torrentkim)
Ilandar	A few reasons:  * As others have said, your advice isn't based on official recommendations made by the Korean government so it's hard to take it seriously.   * This sub gets bombarded with uneducated/ignorant Westerners from /r/worldnews every time North Korea does something. I realise the Western media loves to stir up the panic, but the reality is that for those living in Korea (including many regulars in this sub) life goes on as normal and there's nothing they can do about it. It gets tiring hearing the same fear mongering from people that are more interested in sharing their Wikipedia links than actually learning about Korean culture.   * Your essay is super long and no one wants to waste their time reading it. 
Ilandar	City's passing has been awful so far...

Ilandar	> Not sure why the change in name was necessary  Wasn't it to encourage discussion of other management sims, like FIFA Manager or mobile games? It didn't really work since everything other than FM gets downvoted.
Ilandar	> You havent provided much reason that anyone should change  You are commenting in a thread about fake torrents on TPB. The other top thread today is about bitcoin miners on TPB. If that's not reason enough to change, then good luck to you. You'll need it.
Ilandar	People say "in goals" all the time in Australia. There's no right or wrong way to say it.  EDIT: I think it comes from AFL where there are 4 goalposts. 
Ilandar	I haven't been to Gojji yet so I'll have to take your word for it. Most places have a time limit, though. 
Ilandar	So am I, to be fair.

Ilandar	AI starts Lucas Moura in goals (FM 2016) | 
Ilandar	wat
Ilandar	#**NIGEL PEARSON INTENSIFIES**  EDIT: Not really sure how to explain this. The AI decided to start Lucas Moura in goals, even though they have one senior (and multiple youth) keepers available. Moura has not played in goals at all this season, and almost always starts on the wing. He's their best player and has routinely caused me problems. I don't think there's any animosity between him and Pearson.  I'm currently playing the match and leading 0 - 1 after Moura failed to stop a Tom Ince long shot. He did actually punch the ball away from the first free kick of the match, though. I don't know how to handle this match now, because part of me is saying "GO ALL OUT ATTACK THEY HAVE A SHIT KEEPER" and the other half recognises that the rest of their team is still really good.  15 minutes in and Pearson has now moved Moura to centre midfield and put Badelj in goals.  27 minutes in and now it's Soares in there. What is going on?  37 minutes and now it's Galloway. I'm going to stop updating now because they seem to be rotating constantly...  HALF TIME AND THEY SUBBED ON WELBECK SO THEY COULD PUT HIM IN GOALS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA  Final score was 1 - 5. Sabitzer was the best of the Everton keepers, making a nice diving save in the second half. Galloway was probably the worst, conceding several goals, whilst Álvarez conceded the funniest of the goals where he punched it into his own player, then made an insane reflex save that kept the ball rolling across the line until Ince tapped it in.
Ilandar	The best is Dae Jang Geum (English name is Korean Charcoal BBQ) on Glen Osmond Road. It has a great buffet full of Korean dishes (instead of bad attempts at Japanese COUGHKOBACOUGH) and the meat is good. Also staffed by Koreans instead of Chinese or white people. Unsurprisingly, it's very popular with Koreans living in Adelaide.   Don Don is pretty good in terms of Korean food (has some good dishes you can order) but quite small and doesn't have fans over the tables. It doesn't have a buffet but service is reasonably quick. It's a bit dirty inside and one of my friends said some Koreans avoid it for hygiene reasons. Also staffed and run by Koreans.   KOBA has a nice atmosphere with friendly service but the buffet is bad and it can be really hard to get service during peak hours. The buffet always runs out and you get all these people wandering around trying to decide which leftovers they want. The owner is Korean but he's creepy and the staff are a mixed bag of Chinese and white people. 
Ilandar	> I wonder if they would do a chart with hours played and how it would look?  Football Manager and Crusader Kings 2.
Ilandar	I think people forget just how incredible Galekovic was in his prime. His first ~6 seasons at Adelaide he had a blinder pretty much every game. Even during the seasons when we were shit, he made so many insane stops. Probably his biggest weakness was high balls but I still think he's the best. 
Ilandar	FM 17 is better. The core gameplay is still very similar and you'd probably enjoy both, but 17 has more alternative game modes (fantasy draft) and can be unofficially updated to the 17/18 season which may give it longer playability, depending on your interests.   I recommend 17, unless you're on an extreme budget. 
Ilandar	Ah yes, the Luddite defence. If it works, why change it amirite? 
Ilandar	I thought something was going to happen but it really was just a 20 second video of a sign that never changes...
Ilandar	date tongue hole
Ilandar	Why are people still using TPB in 2017? It's so bad...
Ilandar	I'm actually a quietly confident Adelaide supporter. :)
Ilandar	We said that about FM 17 and it turned out okay. The 64 bit option was a significant improvement for those who could support it. 
Ilandar	I do the same, though I normally don't manage big clubs so my wage is usually fairly low.   I also don't manage in countries I don't want to live in and instead try to get jobs in great locations where my manager could settle down and enjoy life. 
Ilandar	So, bland and overpriced?
Ilandar	You can update the transfers [here](https://sortitoutsi.net/football-manager-data-update) and change the start date [here](https://sortitoutsi.net/football-manager-start-date).  The fantasy draft just lets you pick a squad using a draft system and then play against AI or human drafted teams. It's fun if you have friends.

Ilandar	What's an "American-style" burger? 
Ilandar	Judging by the comments, this whole sub is depressed.
Ilandar	I think whether or not I like it will depend on how dark the blue trimming is. It looks almost black in the previews but hopefully it will be lighter in person. I love the piping shrike on the back - definitely the best feature of the new shirt. The socks also look great. I think the plain red thing is a bit boring (coloured sides or faint stripes make a big difference), but overall it's pretty solid. 
Ilandar	Bounce? 
Ilandar	> Are you mental?  This is a guy who freaked out because his friend tried to bring their girlfriend to his birthday party. He was so concerned by this serious turn of events that he asked for help on reddit! 
Ilandar	Wow, you're really defensive. Lighten up champ - I'm sure next year's birthday party will have clowns and an ice cream cake! 
Ilandar	> generally more deaths (especially when there exist more graphic images and video of such deaths) is going to be found to be more horrible by the layman.   I don't think that's true. It's more about which group of people we find it easier to relate to, which is why Australians don't seem to give a shit about lives lost in South America, Asia, Africa or the Middle East but will feel very moved when they hear about deaths in Europe or America.  Also consider that many of us grew up learning all about the terrible things that happened during the Second World War, whilst our Australian history skipped over many of the atrocities that happened here.
Ilandar	You mean aside from the weeaboo thing?
Ilandar	I was really tempted by the Mi Max 2 but the size put me off. Amazing phone for the price, though.

Ilandar	[It could have been worse...](http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19159703)
Ilandar	I thought he was good. Not great defensively, though he worked hard, but he always looked dangerous on the overlap. I think he's better as a wing back or fullback making a run around his winger, rather than playing further forward. He reminds me a lot of Cássio in that he's dangerous going forward but not 100% suited to a left wing position. I think if we keep developing him he could turn out to be the new Cássio. His main weakness is positioning, but it's hard to say how much of that was down to the instructions he was given. 
Ilandar	The big smartphone manufacturers have conned everyone into thinking they need a high-end smartphone and that it's actually worth $1000+. It's crazy how much control this industry has over it's consumers.

Ilandar	Nope.  The country is going to shit, people you once thought were nice decent people turn out to be complete arseholes who think that some people shouldn't have the same rights as they do because of those peoples political preferences. Everything is either "left" or "right", and no one is decent or nice anymore. Everyone wants "their" rights to supercede "your" rights and will complain and act like a nasty piece of shit to get their way. Why should someones fondness for riding their bicycle at 10 km/h in a 100 km/h zone on a winding road during peak hour be restricted by my fondness to get to work? Why can't you spit and curse at that poor person who just spent the night sleeping rough under a bush in a park? Why does the school your kids go too have to cater to the kids from that poor family who can never afford excursions and who bully others because that's all they see at home? Can't the school just kick them out and get some kids more like my kids?; I haven't watched commercial TV or listened to commercial radio in over a year because it's full of ads for stuff I'll either never want to buy or are sold by businesses I'll never buy off. I run an extension that prevents any Carlos Slim/Jeff Bezos owned website from loading on my browser and I'm still surprised at how many news websites get blocked by it. I do notice that people around me are getting angrier about stuff but all they do to cope is find new ways to escape it and run away from the media that seems to exist purely to make us all angry about this, that or the other - just all so that they can make more people hate each other than they did last year. And then these same media conglomerates complain to the government because their actions are driving people away from them so they end up losing money so why can't the government impeach the American president or bring in more illegal immigrants or change the laws to make it so that people have to give them money! Things seem to be increasingly run for a small few, who seem to be growing increasingly aloof and rude to anyone not of their ilk. From riding their $5000 carbon fibre bicycle through red lights and never using the bicycle lanes, to wanton breaking of the law and committing violence because the punishment for violent crimes is usually a tiny slap on the wrist and smaller than the punishments for small things like speeding or pulling wheelies. And like a pvper in an MMO, they are not averse to leaving a trail of destruction in their wake in order to get their own jollies. For some reason they are also the first to complain about their "rights" being interfered with as they happily trample the rights of others. The future looks increasingly bleak and when you look into the face of a child in 2017, you don't know whether to be happy for them as they start on their new lives with wide open eyes and a myriad of opportunities ahead of them, or sad at the fact that they are one more on an increasingly crowded planet that is rapidly going down the shitter of species decline, dying reefs, increasing incidents of scientific denial and statistics denial, the promotion of hateful religion that imposes Sharia law, and increasingly authoritarian socialist governments run by billionaires, for billionaires. The fact that "See it all before it goes" is now a choice for holidays says something about the world that we live in and the one that the 3 year old happily playing in the park in blissful unawareness will be facing; It pisses me off that a profession like "policy researcher" for a male politician is seen as something to be aspired too with wealth, fame and travel, whereas a profession such as "primary school teacher" is seen as great way to acquire the label of "pedo". Am I ok? Well actually I should be because I'm better off than 99% of the world. I have a job, I drink clean water, I have Fibre to the place so I can download Game of Thrones in HD in less than a minute, and I have a backyard that I own I can sit down in and watch the clouds float by without worrying about too many things that affect me personally. I could sit back and be an arsehole and not worry about all of the things above, and the thousands of other things that are to numerous to mention. But that's not me. So no, I'm actually not OK
Ilandar	ITT: Young people excusing their thousand dollar luxury purchases. 
Ilandar	My partner has an Oppo R9 Plus. Battery life is also amazing on this phone and it has VOOC charging. The 16 MP selfie camera is another great feature.  I used to buy old second hand flagships (for the price and low environmental impact) but since removable batteries are now a thing of the past buying an old phone is much riskier. That's why I ended up going for a Chinese phone this time.

Ilandar	How do those of you who go to the games feel about the result? Some Derby fans seemed excited about the prospect of a trip to Wembley, so I'm sure they won't be happy that Rowett played a shit 11 and then lost. Normally I wouldn't care about the cup but it's a bit disappointing that we didn't build any momentum from the 5 - 0.

wretchedink	But you know, he died the way his dad did: he died to protect the people he loved; which was really incredible! No one shows greater love than when he lays down his life for his friends.   Speaking of Sasuke, he ends up training Naruto's son (Boruto) in the new movie. From what I've seen in the trailer, Boruto learns Chidori AND Rasengan!  YES! They are! Sasuke, Rock Lee, and Neiji are all pretty tough shinobi. Aside from his cool and colelctive nature, I love Neiji's fighting style; Bāguà zhǎng (which literally means "eight trigrams palms).   Trivia Time! Bāguà zhǎng is the same fighting style that Airbenders use.
wretchedink	The app I use now (Animania. They also have other apps connected with them for manga, dubbed anime and American cartoons, and Asian drama. Total heaven for me.) works really well. They have the option for "censored" and "uncensored" for more graphic anime (like Tokyo Ghoul), which is always pretty cool! I KNOW! We've been with these characters for so long, they almost feel like family, eh? Kishimoto did an excellent job with character development, and causing the readers and viewers to really care for the characters and their lives. I almost cried after Neiji died. He was my favorite character from the beginning. It was sad to see him go. :(
wretchedink	Really? Which app did you use? I tried using a torrenting app  on my Android (Doctor Who episodes and whatnot), but I think I may have downloaded a nasty virus; I crashed it; hence I use the app.   I have so much catching up to do; I'm in episode 400.

wretchedink	A Call From the Psychic | Yeah, you read that right! A psychic woman suffering from a concussion and a past lives complex; what a combination, eh?  I had just gotten a new job as a receptionist at a law office! I loved answering phones, and greeting guests and browsing Reddit in my free time! It was a slow day. Not many calls, or guests. It wasn't until almost closing time, that I got a call, that shook me up from the moment I answered.  Her voice was like a tuning fork; clear and quiet. She sounded like a gentle woman, and quite motherly in fact. Just a sweet woman! The first thing she said was that she had a concussion. I started panicking right there and then! I get wigged out when I hear something that serious! I started to calm down as she kept talking.  She mentioned the name of the firm she was looking for but seeing that it wasn't our firm, I began to politely tell her that she had the wrong number. She wasn't having any of that. She kept telling me her story, over, and over; about how she was a psychic suffering from a concussion. She had a nasty car accident and was trying to get back in touch with her lawyer. Maybe she lost the number or something or other. She wasn't gonna let me get off of the phone anytime soon. I thought about just hanging up on her but two things kept me on the line:  1.) I just couldn't do it! She sounded so sweet, and really out of it that I felt bad about haning up on her! Besides, I only hang up on scammers (and boy do I get my share of scammers!)  2.) As a writer, I felt I could glean somethings about her that could turn her into a character for a story!  Anyway, as we started talking I learned a bit about her. She was a single woman in her mid-forties with, "skin like milk, eyes like the ocean, and hair like fire" (her description, not mine). She'd lived dozens of lives before and couldn't remember most of them after her accident, save for the most recent life. She was an Alaskan boy, (in anime fashion...my description, not her's) who "swore to protect and provide for her family". While out fishing, she was murdered; shot in the back by....someone......   At this point I'm to myself, *That must've been one bad car accident to have her think she was a psychic.*  That's when....that's when she starts telling me things about myself, things she couldn't have known (unless she was stalking me.......). She knew how many people in my family I had, she knew my ethnic background, she even knew more *personal* things that I *dare* not say online.......  Anywho, I kept in touch with her for a few weeks; seeing as she was suffering from a concussion and couldn't get in touch with her lawyer I kinda wanted to stay in touch with her; make sure she was all right. Then again, maybe I was mystified by her "psychic" abilities and slightly quirky personality. She was an odd woman and a breath of fresh air. Maybe I kinda had a crush on her?  We lost contact with each other after awhile. But I enjoyed talking with her. She was quite lovely, I must say.  Anyway.......that was my experience with a psychic woman, who has lived passed lives, and was suffering from a concussion.   
wretchedink	Hehe! Kid's say the darnedest things, eh? Did you ever respond back back to their salty language?

wretchedink	Nerdy Latina Gall from Barnes and Noble; Let's Meet! | I was about seventeen years old at the time, and just getting into the swing of being a geek (I was plagued by all of my geeky interests, but didn't know what to call it!). My family and I took a little vacation to a hotel a few cities away; a family tradition to help us unwind from the daily grind of life.    On the last day of our vacation, I bugged my parents to let my brother and I go the Barnes and Noble; the bookstore was on its way to being shut down, and I desperately needed to walk in there and be surrounded by people who speak my language! As my brother wandered into the computer hacking section (don't worry, he won't hack your dating profile and spill all your info >:) ) I made my way towards the manga/comic books aisle. Because the store was on its way to closing, they crammed all of their comics and manga onto one shelf; really convenient!    As I was reading Naruto Vol. 25 (I was REALLY into Naruto at the time; I still am!), I happened to look up to my right...and the she was, making he way down the aisle with two guys (who may or may not have been her brothers.     She was a Latina gal. Her dark brown hair was wrapped atop her head in a messy bun. I can't remember what was on her shirt, but I remember that it was white; and she wore blue jeans and a pair of gray and blue Jordan's.     Now, part of me really wanted her to come down into the comic book section! Just hearing her talk about anime with her friends caught my attention at the jump. But the other part of me was really nervous if she came down that section! This was at a time where I would get a little bit nervous around gals that I liked/found attractive (and granted, I still do get a bit nervous......). My half-wish came true as she and her friends made their way down the aisle toward me.    Here is where my memory get's a little fuzzy. I don't know how, or why we started talking. I don't know who made the first move. But it just...happened. We just...talked. We spilled everything we knew about the nerdy things and fandoms we were into (*especially* DC Comics!) As our conversation slowed down, and we picked up comics to read, I noticed something as we stood side-by-side. She was standing close to me. Really. Really close to me. Granted, it wasn't uncomfortable; I don't really have personal space issues. But it was noticeable.    After a few, awkward silent moments, she took a small, discreet side-step towards me, and *bam*....our arms were touching. I know she noticed; because we both were wearing short-sleeved shirts; and there is not way possible she couldn't have noticed how close we were. Her arm was pressed lightly against mine; my caramel skin (I'm a black guy) mixing in a lovely manner with her cinnamon skin We stood like that for a few moments; both of us (well, me specifically), unsure of what to do next.    My phone rang; mom and dad were waiting outside; they were ready to start making our way back home. We bid our farewells--and this girl...she reached out and gave me a side-hug-- *blush* --and I felt my heart soar!     Anywho, my brother and I left the bookstore while her and her friends continued to look around. As we loaded into the family car, I kept thinking that I should've gotten her name, or number...something! I thought about her on the ride back home. I thought about her for the next few days; wondering what she was reading, wondering what she was watching...wondering if she was thinking about me too.  Anywho! Very awesome, nerdy Latina gal from Barnes and Noble....let's meet! I would very much love that!

maria7n	The night before AP scores came out, I had multiple dreams that I checked and every time I got different scores. Same thing happened before the June SAT came out. Needless to say, I was very confused when I actually woke up to check scores lol
maria7n	Tell yourself before you start that this passage is going to be the most interesting that you have ever seen. Once you get into what the passage is saying because you're genuinely interested (or pretending to be) then it will be way easier to comprehend. 
maria7n	So how'd it go?
maria7n	Since the original word is nephew, it also hints at niece being the correct alternative. But, you're right, cousin's could work if the cousin was a girl and cousins' wouldn't because it is plural. 
maria7n	You get to choose the order of your tests and how many to take on test day. If you take less than scheduled, CB will refund you and if you take more than scheduled, they will charge you after the fact.
maria7n	I got a 1500 in June, and all I used was khan academy. Take practice tests.
maria7n	Your score is good enough for any college out there. 
maria7n	Huge congrats!

XLEli	Not a holistic hippie here, but I love talking about chemicals all the same.  The increase in breast cancer in women and men has sky rocketed in the past decades. The amount of chemicals you put in your pits affect the very sensitive glands under your skin. These glands are very close to the glands in the breasts. There has been a surge of breast cancer masses near the sides of the breasts instead of the bottom, top, front.   It's not soap that gives you cancer, it's the added chemicals humans are not supposed to be ingesting that get absorbed into the skin.
XLEli	Not only is that super scary, but no one says 'Thanks for saving our babies life?' WTF

Gingeripso	How Clickbait is Destroying Journalism | Clickbaits have existed for centuries. Those Victorian magazines had [clickbaits](http://blog.almighty.press/is-clickbait-dead-or-stronger-than-ever/)  and, now, we have our own version of online clickbaits. Publishing web  articles with the right kind of clickbait headlines would earn you  millions of dollars. However, Journalism professors and ethical players  in the publishing and media industry agree that clickbaits are  destroying journalism.  **Well, the truth is more than that: Clickbaits have the  potential to ruin how we think. So, before it’s too late, make sure to  educate yourself about clickbaits and take the necessary precautions.**  How does a clickbait work? How can it destroy journalism and how we think?  ### 1. Our brain chemicals are affected and changed by clickbaits  When we like, share, or comment on social media, our brain releases [dopamine](https://www.ama.org/publications/MarketingNews/Pages/feeding-the-addiction.aspx),  a neurochemical that’s known as “reward” chemical. This also happens  when we click on a headline that truly sparks our curiosity.  A clickbait serves this purpose, and it serves it well because we  “want to believe” that there is something valuable behind that  tantalizing headline. This anticipation alone [floods the brain with dopamine](http://www.mdgadvertising.com/blog/the-secret-science-behind-the-art-of-clickbait/).  ### 2. Our brain becomes “addicted” to clickbait headlines  Over time, our brain craves the dopamine that is released after  clicking clickbait headlines. This explains why people are so “addicted”  viewing those silly cat and dog videos. The more they watch those  videos, the happier they feel. The same also happens when we click those  clickbait headlines.  However, psychologists warned us that dopamine doesn’t cause  addiction. Note that I use these parentheses to express that it’s a  metaphor.  According to David J. Ley PhD in [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201701/no-dopamine-is-not-addictive),  “Dopamine’s role in pleasure and reward is  that it helps your brain to recognize “incentive salience.” This means  that it’s like a little red flag to your brain, saying “hey, pay  attention, this is about to feel good, and you want to remember this so  that you can do it again.” A critical issue here is that a lack of  dopamine doesn’t make the experience feel less good.”  So, regardless of whatever it is that makes us feel “addicted”  clickbaits, we should acknowledge and recognize the “danger” of  clickbaits to our mental health and productivity level.  ### 3. Clickbaits prevent us from creating our own mental pictures  Many listicle articles use clickbait headlines. Moreover, those with [Buzzfeed](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/15-crazy-facts-about-buzzfeed-that-will-totally-blow-your-mind/)  models are likely to use animated GIF images. While these images look  cute and can be quite expressive, these images are meant to “shout” than  merely illustrate.  [Researchers in Teaching English as Foreign Language (TEFL)](http://ijh.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.26/prod.1658)  find that the right visual aids and visualization would help learners  to retain new concepts better and longer. Thus, when a listicle article  comes with its own “shouting” GIF image, it spoon feeds readers with  that specific mental image, without providing sufficient room for  readers to come up with their own mental model. Over time, those GIFs  “numb” our mind.  ### 4. Many articles with clickbait headlines don’t deliver any substance  Yep, many of those listicle articles with clickbait headlines serve  no purpose other than to entertain us. Do you think that article about  “77 Naughty Dogs with Weird Faces” would make us a smarter, more  skilled, and more informed person? I can guarantee you that it wouldn’t.  But if you read this article “[The Youngest of the Little Rock Nine Speaks About Holding Onto History](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/youngest-little-rock-nine-speaks-about-holding-onto-history-180964732/#iG0Y613ItJhKH8ML.99),” most likely you’d be a little bit more informed than yesterday.  Also, check out this article “[The Unlikely Medical History of Chocolate Syrup](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/unlikely-medical-history-chocolate-syrup-180964779/)”  sounds like a clickbait, apparently it’s a legit article published by  uber-prestigious the Smithsonian Magazine. Way to go, Smithsonian!  ### 5. Clickbaits make us more emotional instead of more objective  Clickbaits [feed our emotional needs](https://www.good.is/articles/online-lists-are-making-you-dumber),  instead of intellectual deep-thinking needs. When reading clickbait  articles has become a habit, we’d be accustomed to superficial and  no-substance emotional reading. In other words, reading emotional-based  articles train our subjective “emotional brain,” instead of our evolved  objective, intelligent human brain.  > **For the lack of sassier term: Clickbait makes you dumber.**  ### 6. Many clickbait articles are the antithesis of objective journalism  It goes without saying. [Objectivity is the most important pillar in journalism](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/journalism-essentials/what-is-journalism/elements-journalism/).  According to The Elements of Journalism by Bill Kovach and Tom  Rosenstiel, the number one element of journalism is “its obligation to  tell the truth.” In other words, any piece of work that doesn’t tell the  truth or not objective is a piece of garbage.  And many clickbait articles fall into this “garbage” category. I’m  not generalizing here because some reputable publications have started  to use headlines that sound more “clickbaity” to compete with “sleazy”  clickbait articles.  ### 7. When reading clickbait articles has become a habit, journalistic  articles wouldn’t be able to keep our “craving” brain satisfied  (journalism destroyed)  Listicle and clickbait articles are proofs that readers prefer “fast food” than “gourmet” articles. It shows that[ the power has shifted from print to web-based publications](https://theconversation.com/four-reasons-why-listicles-and-clickbait-are-killing-real-journalism-67406), as people’s reading attention span diminishes online and reading listicles are faster and easier to digest.  Imagine you’re in a subway train on the way to work and you’re  standing wobbly because n more seats are available. Would you prefer  reading a listicle like this “10 Ways to Help You Going to the Bathroom  Naturally” written by a health blogger or a long-form health article “[New Study Offers Support for Prostate Testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/well/live/new-study-offers-support-for-prostate-testing.html)”  published by one of the most prestigious newspapers? Most likely, you’d  read the former as the listicle structure makes it easier to absorb  when your focus isn’t undivided.  At last, due to the low barrier of entry to join the ranks of citizen  bloggers and self-professed pundits, “citizen journalism” is now  available to anyone with or without professional journalism training. In  other words, the writing world has become a “melting pot” of all kinds  of article writers, including clickbait articles.  While pure, professional, and ethical journalism is still necessary  to deliver objective news and analyses in this exceeding chaotic world,  the emergence of clickbait articles can’t be taken lightly. [Elite journalism hasn’t died entirely](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/03/artificla-intelligence-robot-reporter-pulitzer-prize), and we should not let it die at all.

Gingeripso	Can you please suggest a topic for my next long form article? | I want to do a long article, 2000-3000 words. Something that will require research.  My target audience is everyone in this sub, meaning that I want provide something informative and educational to people who are into content marketing.  So I come to you with the question : What kind of article topic would you like to read about?  As long as its related to content marketing and it would serve a purpose for the greater good then I will do all the research required for the topic and come up with something useful for content marketers to read.  Thanks in advance for your help.  I look forward to your positive replies.
Gingeripso	Journalism has been dead a long time already. Now it's nothing but a zombie trying to catch your eyes and not even stimulate any type of critical thinking as the investigative reporting of ancient times is only but a memory.

ardenc	It is not just eggs, or scrambled eggs in particular. Polarizing topics are infinite and then people camp out like its better than football or something. Not that I like football either.
ardenc	I have eaten eggs cooked this way and to me it isn't scrambled eggs but some sort of liquid egg sauce with clumps.  The funny thing is I like soft-boiled egg and fried over easy. I just don't like this mixture. Perhaps I'd like it if the white was cooked separately and the runny yolk mixed afterwards, but that'd make some more work to get it done.  You're Wrong! :D
ardenc	I wonder what Joe Rogan thinks about this kind of scrambled eggs. | 
ardenc	Because I think such scrambled eggs is bullshit. I believe that people who prefer such scrambled eggs are simply wrong because they have some superficial need for something else than the actual food and experience of simply eating.
ardenc	Sounds more and more like [Owen Cook](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/3vb46k/i_think_owen_cook_aka_tyler_durden_real_social/) and others. Almost like a cue for an interview. How would someone like RSDTyler comment that?

ardenc	I have to say I was a bit surprised about how much dislike there was for this guy.  There is the other RSD Todd (?) I think who gives me the creeps but Tyler seems genuine. Or, is he already so good that one can't so easily see past his act? I'm not so sure. I think it would be very difficult for him to be able to create so solid material as is in many of his videos unless he was at least onto something.   Also, I think maybe he has had some nefarious past? Does anyone know better about the history? As I understand he was painted very negatively by the book The Game which was written by another pick up artist. Was that depiction of him real?  I dunno. I think it would be interesting to have one of the characters from that scene to go one on one with Joe about what it is and how things have developed. Could be awful but could also be enlightening. In a way there are some people who have 'trained' hard and had their own kind of success. I'm sure people learn all kinds of things. Even if some of it would be horribly wrong it would be interesting to see it come out.

ardenc	Would it be possible to use pressure from other pressurised systems to simultaneously employ the pressure to its original purpose and at the same time desalinate water using some membrane?  For example, water is pumped to transfer it from A to B. It requires pressure. Add an elastic separate pipe inside that pipe to create a pressure in a parallel system that has membranes somewhere along the line to desalinate. You still get water pumped but at the same time the pressure is used for another application.  I understand there may not be a free lunch here. 
ardenc	Car batteries, capacitors, and joule thieves | I was wondering, why not put some kind of joule thief between a car battery and some array of capacitors, so that if the battery has enough energy to start the car, it will? The thief would prevent starting the car before the capacitors are charged and if it is taking too much time then the battery is really empty.  I hate car batteries. The ordinary car battery dies very quickly if the car is not used regularly making the regular use pretty much compulsory, or the very least you need to hook the car in some outlet somewhere. In a cold climate this is even more so.  ---  Now, I think that once the voltage drops below some level the chemical reaction in the battery is probably so far gone already that should it be extended, the battery can not be recharged anymore. I think this might be one reason.  One other reason I can think of is that there simply isn't that much energy left in the battery anymore that can be drained in any reasonable time.

I remember getting caught underwater and frantically trying to pull my head up over the edge and call for help, but I kept on inhaling and swallowing water. After what felt like a solid minute I saw my dad dive in the pool and save me and I grabbed onto him.

schlickyschloppy	TIFU by wearing a tank top | The usual disclaimer: This happened a week ago tomorrow.  I've recently started a new job where I'm working outside in a vineyard pruning the vines. I love it because I get some fresh air and exercise, rain or shine. Well, the typical BC rain took a break for quite the heat wave. We were able to spend a day on the lake during the long weekend, and fortunately Tuesday was to be warm but not as extreme as our Monday on the water. Thanks to a well prepared friend I could borrow some sunscreen, once my spouse reminded me of the sun's uv rays. I tend to forget the importance of it, since I never burned too severely before. We spend the day floating on the water, tho some suffered sunburn, I did not. It was a good day.  Back to work on Tuesday, and I realize we don't have any sunscreen at home, atleast, none I can find within 10 minutes. My SO had recommended wearing long sleeves for work but I opt for my usual coveralls, with a tank underneath so as not to overheat. (I'd had a form of heat stroke before from wearing too much and hydrating too little.) It was gonna be warm but overcast anyway.  The results are not immediate. I work for 3 hours with my back to the hazy sun behind the clouds. I remain hydrated, but once I get home I notice I'm a little red. I'd had worse, and think nothing of it.  I get a couple chores done at home before I realize I'm exhausted. The newly physical job has taken some getting used to and I assume it's work related and take a nap that turns into 4 hours. I wake up disoriented and momentarily think it's morning of the next day.  My back is red, and burning. I throw on some aloe vera and start dinner. Eventually, within a couple hours I have a cold compress on what feels like the worst area of my back/shoulder.  The next few days i wear long sleeves outside, hydrate like a mofo and slather on aloe or lotion in a similar way. I have the chills or I'm overheating and I can never regulate myself, among other symptoms I'm learning are related to my burn.  My nights are uncomfortable, moving hurts, and my back and shoulders burn.   There's a point where I find it odd that my burn hasn't let up over 24-36 hrs. It's still red, and hot. I get alot of flack from my husband, *I told you so's, and now you've learned*, etc.  Friday - my usual work, I get home and clean the house too. We have guests coming for dinner. I decide to mow the lawn too. It's another hot day but I use a high protection sunblock and remain covered up.  It's a huge yard, I'm exhausted, sweating and hot. Straight inside for a cool/lukewarm  shower. I am soaping myself up, careful of my burn and the water temperature. Suddenly I notice my skin is bumpy. This is a development.   I don't know why, or how, perhaps part of the healing process, but I'm covered in tiny blisters. It's so disgusting it's shocking.   I spend far too much time researching remedies to bring the blisters down. I try vinegar, which helps but stings.  The rest of this weekend I've been coating my burns in vinegar before and after bed. The blisters will calm down at times, and then flair up at other times, usually when I'm active and my body temperature is raised.  It's healing, but very slowly. I underestimated the sun and I'm very very sorry.     TL;DR: I ignored my spouse's advice to cover up in the sun, I got a serious 2nd degree sunburn.  IMAGES TO COME!  Edit:  https://imgur.com/gallery/GEEKI
schlickyschloppy	Oh good, I was worried it was greyscale. 
schlickyschloppy	Right? I thought I'd had the wrong link until I tested it.   I've *also* never had the blisters before this, so I consider it a lesson taught. 
schlickyschloppy	Yeah, I had read that the water blisters help protect the layers of skin underneath from further sun damage.

But technically, from the point of view of a straight male who's into a particular genre of music, encountering a female that he's attracted to making a mistake about the genre specifics, he WOULD consider that cute.   I don't understand Reddit sometimes. 
schlickyschloppy	Oh ok, I get it...  ಠ_ಠ 
schlickyschloppy	That's not even cute, it's just revolting

schlickyschloppy	Typical!
schlickyschloppy	How would this affect people with allergies, though? I'd be ecstatic to be allowed to get a dog. However, I have many friends with asthma/allergies that can't be in my house due to my cat.  Some people are so sensitive that a place that once had cats can be a trigger. It would be ridiculously hard to find a pet-virgin place, so to speak.
schlickyschloppy	Eyyyyy
schlickyschloppy	You didn't either...... Right? 
schlickyschloppy	Clearly, as your username even sounds like a pet food. 
schlickyschloppy	I did something similar, but it was on purpose. Get this, my reasoning was that I was curious WHAT IT SMELLED LIKE! My curiosity overpowered my common sense. I sprayed the air, cautiouly leaned in for a whiff.... Noped the fuck out. I hastily closed the door to my mum's room and told no one. The idea that it would hang around in the air for hours, didn't occur to me. Mum thought she was having an allergic reaction when she got home from work that evening. 😐
schlickyschloppy	Do you write books? Because, I'd read them if you did.
schlickyschloppy	Super greeeen!
schlickyschloppy	Are there a lot of people also taking their sisters to the dog park? I should consider bringing mine, they might like meeting other people's sisters. Do they smell eachother and such?
schlickyschloppy	I did too. I figured I just wouldn't comment at all.
schlickyschloppy	Divide*
schlickyschloppy	I use alot, alot. I apologize. 
schlickyschloppy	That is a lot of downvotes.
schlickyschloppy	Glad to hear it.
schlickyschloppy	I did a ton of googling thinking perhaps it was a quote from a book or something well known. Nothing really stood out tho, as an original text, but yeah, I did see it used with North Korea more than once. 
schlickyschloppy	>"The great leader is infallible"  I see this said from time to time, but what is it quoting?
schlickyschloppy	I find Kenny's deaths are usually pretty wonderful.
schlickyschloppy	Even a little nudge to rock the cradle. That was fantastic.
schlickyschloppy	Bill Pullman, when he flips over the railing in The Grudge. I saw it in theatre and laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. Took me a while took take the movie seriously.
schlickyschloppy	The beginning of the Diva Dance song from The Fifth Element.
schlickyschloppy	That is hilarious
schlickyschloppy	OK.... Thousands of tiny, very specific, passive aggressive comments.  Edit: Perhaps you were thinking of Lingchi, death by a thousand tiny cuts.
schlickyschloppy	Passive aggression
schlickyschloppy	I relate to that a lot.
schlickyschloppy	What would you tell your younger self? | Write a lot, or a little. Depends on you, I guess.
schlickyschloppy	Just the one? 
schlickyschloppy	Ugh, I loved my singles years, it really did go downhill after ten.
schlickyschloppy	What would you tell your younger self about you now? | 
schlickyschloppy	I thought the grapes man was a grapist. 
schlickyschloppy	I did this. I'm still glad I did, even if I'm not working in that field now.
schlickyschloppy	He is absolutely gorgeous.
schlickyschloppy	A young man is tracked by the socks and tissues he leaves in his wake.
schlickyschloppy	I'm officially a huge radiator of your comics. Actually, I sent the link to my friends so it's true.  Edit: I'll do my best to emit heat and a slight rattle now and then.
schlickyschloppy	We don't know eachother, but I'm friending you, k?  Edit: there's no option for becoming a fan or air conditioner of your work. 
schlickyschloppy	I also say do it
schlickyschloppy	I was in an abusive relationship, yes an escape option would have been reassuring to know it was there. Knowing you're not alone to face the situation is an amazing feeling.
schlickyschloppy	I like this concept. Were I still in the dating scene, I'd be reassured to see something similar implemented in places I would frequent. Just an escape option if I seriously wasn't comfortable with my date or company.  I'm sure it could get abused, though, and the establishment might choose to hone the system.
schlickyschloppy	There's always *money* in the *sex tapes*!
schlickyschloppy	I believe you.
schlickyschloppy	The exclamation marks after *No* really fuck up the clarity of the sign.
schlickyschloppy	Less filter would be great, thanks.
schlickyschloppy	No, that's an egg yolk. 
schlickyschloppy	He looks a bit like Vincent Price.
schlickyschloppy	Smackertoonies?
schlickyschloppy	I love that he has a "previous cat".
schlickyschloppy	It looks great. Very good condition.
schlickyschloppy	What a great way to be. No pent up, repressed, passive aggressive shit.

Oskar_Koch	But also take into consideration that if lightning network reaches the amount of transactions that VISA does, then naturally the number of on-chain txs would increase significantly as well. 
Oskar_Koch	Andreas Anotonopolous on Fungibility, privacy, anonymity of Bitcoin. | 
Oskar_Koch	Segwit usage by businesses & exchanges seems to be rather passive, despite the financial incentive of cutting the costs of transactions by a third. Why? | Despite having weeks and weeks in advance to start looking into SegWit and activating it soon after it went live, it seems many businesses & exchanges are rather slowly joining the party, which I find really suprising.   Shouldn't they as a business who produces thousands of txs every single day have the most financial incentive to cut the costs of their fees by a third?   What are the possible challenges for why it takes so long for them? 
Oskar_Koch	I did, took me an hour to figure out how. Hence wanted to clarify why it might be taking so long for businesses.
Oskar_Koch	That makes sense. Hmm.. so I guess the way forward is through user demand. Do we have any other options besides constantly messaging them about it? 
Oskar_Koch	How cool would that be for hardware wallets? |

Oskar_Koch	I'd say invest in education rather than speculation first. Think about earning BTC for what you already do. Give a 10% discount to encourage your clients.   Hodling is not a bad idea too :)
Oskar_Koch	Remember why we're here, looking back this is gonna be just a small blip. We've got segwit coming down the pipeline followed by a number of countless innovations that will help us get true privacy as well as instant transactions :)

Oskar_Koch	Well I won't mind actually. It'd be cool to show my grand children that million dollar pizza I bought a decade ago.    And if it ever reaches such enormous adoption, then i'm sure I'd be very happy with my remaining 99.98% of the stack.
Oskar_Koch	I personally would love to have this design printed on the back with a small white bitcoin symbol in the front left or right pec area. It'd kick ass!
Oskar_Koch	Beautiful, kinda sucks there's no option to buy it with bitcoin, but fiat will do too :) Thank you, you're great!

Oskar_Koch	Isn't the point of bitcoin to become your own bank? Haha.     Anyways, hopefully it'll introduce the concept of bitcoin to some new people and will help them when making a shift from fiat to sound money ;)
Oskar_Koch	Not bitcoin, but a bitcoin-like currency. Stop with those clickbait titles please ;)   Source:  "Palestinian officials are planning for the territory to have its own digital-only currency within five years."    "authorities are mulling a bitcoin-style solution"
Oskar_Koch	Sounds like buying a fixed amount (dollar-cost-averaging) every week/month would be the best option for you. You won't have to worry whether it might or not be a good time to buy.  You can read more about it here: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp

Oskar_Koch	You can use GUI, as a remote node. Uses very little bandwidth.    go to settings tab and change:    "localhost:18081" to "node.moneroworld.com:18081"  then save. done.
Oskar_Koch	Interesting to hear that from you /u/americanpegasus, as I value your opinion. I know it might be not the best place to discuss this, but could you expand on why is Ethereum not so good?  I can agree with you on pre-mining and not really sure what you mean by the term "ICO'd" ?   Ether seems to have some interesting use cases like uber 2.0 and tons of other interesting apps that are being build on top of it, which apparently wouldn't be so easy when using other cryptocurrencies.  Having said that I personally hold 0 ETH. Just trying to learn about it :))
Oskar_Koch	RemindMe! 3 years "Can you buy a lambo with 1 BTC?"

elfootman	>They are untrue only becomes humans have corrupted the truth teachings,and certain religions were brought for certain times and places.   I'm not following...   Also, an ideology working in some place, or its effectiveness, has no relation with its truthiness.

How can we maximize humanity well being? Living according to reality. As far as I know the only "religion" that does that is the one proposed by Rev. Michael Dowd.

Estan marcadas mis opiniones. Me gustaria saber las de ustedes. Estoy dispuesto a conversar sobre alguno de estos puntos si a alguien le interesa.  Mis mayores objeciones son en los puntos 3, 4, y 5.  -----------  fuente: [Link](http://www.senadorvirtual.cl/dgeneral.php?ideleg=3617&nroboletin=11386-03&idboletin=11896) por si les interesa participar. 
elfootman	* Promoverá la generación de conocimiento, el desarrollo tecnológico y la innovación de base científica y tecnológica.  * Se creará la Agencia de Investigación y Desarrollo, que se relacionará con el Presidente de la República a través del ministro de Ciencia y Tecnología y será el sucesor legal de CONICYT.  * La iniciativa consagrará por ley un Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación para el Desarrollo, sucesor del actual Consejo de Innovación (CNID).  Bravo! Como ya lo dijeron, es un paso en la direccion correcta en mi opinion.
elfootman	**punto 3:** La considero una pregunta "trampa". Si bien el objetivo es que hayan mas mujeres, para que como consecuencia vayan mas hombres y asi lograr mas ingresos para el local. Afirmar que "asegurar la disponibilidad de mujeres" es sexista y las trata como objetos. Que es justamente lo que la ley busca prevenir entiendo yo.  **Punto 4:** Mujeres entran gratis no implica debilitar su posicion frente a los hombres. Incluso me atreveria a afirmar lo contrario.   **Punto 5:** Prohibir la entrada gratis a mujeres no implica aumentar su proteccion frente a agresiones. 
elfootman	Hace 2 horas NK lanzo un misil que paso por [sobre Japon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/705kaz/north_korea_may_have_launched_a_missile_according/)  Algunos de los puntos preocupantes:  *  Las pruebas nucleares de NK se han vuelto muchisimo mas frecuentes, comparadas con los ultimos 4 años. * Poseen capacidad nuclear y misiles intercontinentales.  * Factor Trump no ayuda. * China, Rusia sus principales socios economicos no han apoyado significativamente los castigos correspondientes.  Quienes estan en mayor riesgo son Corea del Sur, Japon y Guam. Aunque el problema para el resto del mundo seria una depresion economica bastante grande. Recomiendo darse una vuelta por Youtube y buscar informacion por ahi. Sobretodo comentarios de los gobiernos de USA y sus aliados. Asi como China, Rusia, Japon y Corea del Sur.

elfootman	Un insumo es algo que se compra, un objeto algo inanimado. No veo como una mujer cae en esas categorias. 
elfootman	Lo mas caro que me he traido fue un [joystick, thruster y pedales](https://images10.newegg.com/ProductImage/26-280-082-Z01.jpg). Le pague 40 dolares a la mina q me lo trajo.
elfootman	Esta afirmando que el objetivo es aumentar la disponibilidad de mujeres para los hombres. Entiendo que el objetivo es maximizar ingresos para el establecimiento.

elfootman	Era muy buena :(
elfootman	I punish the WHO and blame the WHY.
elfootman	Not if you believe killing in the name of god is a good thing.   
elfootman	Lots of people say they believe because they think it makes them better people. As Dennett says, belief in belief.
elfootman	Thousand of children practically donated to mosques, take the Red Mosque in Pakistan. There kids are taught to memorize the Koran from 7am to 9pm. Once a year they can visit their parents. long story short, all kids ended joining ISIS when adults.   How is this the children's fault?   ------   I totally back Steven Weinberg's quote:   *"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion."* 
elfootman	Again, both share guilt.  Who becomes a suicide bomber? A person.  Why did he became a suicide bombed? Because of religion.     
elfootman	Both are to blame. If you don't see the evil religion has done and is doing, then I'd argue you're willingly ignoring it.  I consider those doing the killing as victims. If I had been indoctrinated from child, I'd probably be doing the same. Still they are to be recused from society or killed.
elfootman	I love Michael Dowd's definition, where god is reality. This definition applies for most of human existence.
elfootman	I never said the contrary.
elfootman	I get good ping from Chile. Also a new Amazon server is opening in Chile, I hope that will help improve connection.
elfootman	Lets keep teaching radical Islam. But then act surprised when a suicide bomber kills someone. We will never come to agreement.   Hitler and Nazism both share guilt. We punish the individual, and teach the ideology is evil. Yes, even though it's not ultimately evil.
elfootman	Sorry but are you going to create a similar post for every natural disaster?
elfootman	I didn't say the ideology is the sole responsible. Culture and nurture plays a major role in what people believe, thus on their actions.  You just cannot blame only the individual since determinism is true.
elfootman	Ideologies can be to blame. Suicide bombers are doing this because they believe they are doing good, doing god's will.  An ideology that instructs you to kill and brainwashes its followers is evil. Bronze Age tribalism.
elfootman	What a cheap way to try to remove the guilt of some religion institutions.   It's as stupid as to say the bullet is to blame when someone shoots dead someone else. 
elfootman	Clearly a consequence of evolution.
elfootman	How can people like this even be in office? This clearly shows the government is running us, and not the other way around.
elfootman	You can do this using spaceengine, a free windows application, and it's more scientifically accurate. This gif is missing some light effects.
elfootman	Correct
elfootman	The title is missing the rest of the quote:  >To thrive a person must be optimistic, spiritual or religious, motivated, proactive, enjoy learning, flexible, adaptable, socially competent and have good self belief. They also must have opportunity, support from family and colleagues, a calm environment, trust and a high degree of autonomy.  How could one isolate each one of those factors? Personally I don't think you can.

elfootman	Extrapolating patterns based on a single occurrence...
elfootman	Lucky us this is a videogame.
elfootman	Religious thinking should be eliminated. Indoctrinated fundamentalists are not to blame IMO.
elfootman	It has been said like a million times fun gameplay will take precedence over realism. Discussing balance now is a waste of time.

elfootman	  I only care making the game fun and entertaining. Making most vehicles a viable option. If ground vehicles get obliterated by "gunships" I'd buff ground vehicles, if that's not possible, nerf ships.   For example, increase fuel usage, or making those thrusters overheat if you remain still floating on a planet/moon. As long as there's a lore explanation, I'm OK with it.  
elfootman	I really like the analogy Christopher Hitchens makes regarding to death and afterlife. The last part is highly influenced by Matt Dillahunty's thoughts as well.  One of the things believers dislike about death the most, I think, is the fact you will get, at one time, tapped on the shoulder and said that the party is not over, but that you have to leave, and that the party is going on without you.   One of the beautiful points of this analogy is that it shows we're all on the same party. It's in our best interest to have a good time. So one thing you shouldn't do is to start throwing chairs, or do whatever you want to do, just because you feel like doing it. Because then you will be asked to leave the party. We want to have a good party. We should work together to improve everyone's experience and wellbeing. I'm now diverging to morality, but you get the idea.

McDreads	psytribe single day tickets? | I was talking with somebody I met at Oregon Eclipse at the psytrance stage and he mentioned to me that Psytribe sells single day tickets to their event for $20. Can anyone confirm this to be true? I assume it would only be on the last day of the festival.  I've heard of this event many times and I would finally love to attend. However, I will be attending Youtopia at the same venue the weekend prior and I don't want to burn myself out too bad. One day of Psytribe will suffice for me.

McDreads	That's amazing! I can't think of a more appropriate event to play this song at
McDreads	Lee Foss always killed it, so bummed I missed his set. Damn military time
McDreads	There are a couple sets up on the Facebook Group, I'm sure more sets will be uploaded with time
McDreads	Ah I didn't know he waasn't announced on the lineup. Someone told me that I had to see him so I did. He was the perfect act to open up the festival for me :)
McDreads	I was watching Thugfucker's set at the Sky stage while waiting on some friends, got bored and decided to walk around and explore the venue by myself that night. I happened to stumble into the big top while the Pyronauts were just starting. At first, it was a live band/DJ set then they brought out different fire performers one by one. That was my favorite surprise act of the festival!
McDreads	1.) Polish Ambassador  2.) Pyronauts  3.) STS9 @ Big Top  4.) Perfect Stranger/1200 Mics (tie)  5.) String Cheese Incident  Honorable Mentions: Desert Hearts crew, Tom Cosm
McDreads	These are amazing! Thanks for sharing! :)
McDreads	Where was the surprise Tom Cosm set?
McDreads	Does anyone have videos or photos of the solar eclipse that they would love to share? | I've seen so many good ones that bring back the memory of the festival and sharing that special moment with one another. Unfortunately I messed up my settings before recording so I'd love to see some of your guys' videos and photos  :)
McDreads	Eclipse festivals have historically been based around trance music, with psytrance being a large contributing factor. Symbiosis added bass music, house, techno, and other acts to appeal to the masses and make this a fun festival for everyone. If this is what you really think then I guess this was your last eclipse festival because others will definitely have trance 
McDreads	Was filming the eclipse, realized after the fact that I left my ND filter on and the ISO wasn't set to auto. Video is way too dark and I feel horrible. Is there anything I can do to fix it? | 
McDreads	This is amazing, thanks for sharing!

If I happen to stumble upon a DJ's set who I've been wanting to check out. Even better. To those of you eagerly awaiting the music schedule to drop, I urge you to relax and try not letting a piece of paper plan your entire vacation. Go with the flow of things and I'm sure you'll have a better experience because of it

McDreads	Maybe the poll should also include your 5 worst DJs this year? And those DJs would have points taken away from them?
McDreads	Is there any interest in doing a top 100 DJs poll towards the end of the year? | r/EDM just [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/6s980k/results_top_100_djs_2017_reddit_edition/?st=J65Z80PK&sh=8b7aba1a) their poll results and as you would guess... It's mostly filled with EDM, a popularity contest. Marshmello tops Eric Prydz 😂, Porter Robinson who hasn't released music in over a year takes and has been playing the same set for even longer somehow makes the number 3 spot. Daft Punk even made the list...  I would love it if there were certain guidelines on how you placed your votes. For example, your choice must have released music and played sets in 2017. As well as other guidelines that would change this from a popularity contest to a poll of actual musical talent. Any ideas?  Edit: Maybe the poll should also include your 5 worst DJs this year? And those DJs would have points taken away from them?  Or maybe we should take a step in a completely different direction and instead of voting for best DJ, we can vote on best sets (e.g. Choose your 5 best sets: Solomun @ Tomorrowland 2017, Purple Haze @ EDC 2017, etc...) or we can vote on their productions.
McDreads	So you're saying r/electronicmusic should do the poll instead? Makes sense since the  r/EDM poll is becoming a popularity contest like DJ mag again. Like someone else on this thread mentioned Porter hasn't made music in over a year and daft punk hasn't made music in even longer yet they still made the list
McDreads	[Deadmau5 & Kaskade - I Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK1mLIeXwsQ)  One of the songs that got me into electronic music. I get a rush of nostalgia whenever I listen to this song.

McDreads	Selling tickets for Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Gojira @ Petco Park, San Diego (August 6th) | I bought 2 tickets for the show (Section UI301 row 24 seats 1&2) ($152) (prirntouts) and my buddy bought 2 tickets as well (Section FZ110 row 43 seats 7&8) ($330) (hard tickets). Our friends bailed on us so we're just going to go with each other and we're trying to sell one pair of the tickets. I'm selling them for the face value of what I paid for them which was $152 for the pair ($76 each). And my buddy is selling his tickets for face value at $330 for the pair ($165 each). Whichever pair of tickets sells first, we'll just attend the show with the other pair.  Here's the seating chart and prices on stubhub to compare to: https://www.stubhub.com/metallica-tickets-metallica-with-avenged-sevenfold-and-gojira-san-diego-petco-park-8-6-2017/event/9823756/?qtyddab=true&sort=price+asc  Let me know if you're interested! 
McDreads	No problem, make sure to workout your lower back and glutes adequately to compensate for the large amount of ab training you'll be doing. And some of these incorporate the hip flexors a lot so be sure to stretch those out!
McDreads	I use the app by Athlean x called "6 pack" and I train abs 5 days out of the week after my workout. There's a free version and a paid version ($2.99).  I also incorporate a couple of these each week into my workouts:  Ab exercises   Sit ups with twist   V up roll ups  Upper ab crunches  Windshield wipers (pencil snap engage RC)  Dragon flags   Ab rollouts on TRX  Roll out wheel 7 steps  Landmine rotations 25lbs  Planks on stability ball  L sits  Pike pulses  Hanging clocks  Hanging on bar toes to hands  Plank knee to chest  Superman (prone bird dog)  Front lever  Dumbbell snatch  Palloff Press
McDreads	That's definitely something i considered, but I don't have a torch :( Great idea on the heat shrink, was thinking electrical tape lol  Luckily I found a place that makes custom ubolts, I'll be checking them out later this week. Hopefully it all works out, thanks for the suggestions!
McDreads	Very solid points. I should've also stated in my original reply that I completely agree with your post but it's cool that it's not your cup of tea. 2007/08 was around the time I really started listening to electronic music and Guetta had a pretty big influence in the genre at the time
McDreads	Just playing devil's advocate here. David Guetta was on fire, a great DJ and producer but as soon as he started featuring famous singers, his sound went poppy and his music went to shit... (*cough* Sexy bitch *cough*)  Forgive me if you weren't around electronic dance music in those days, but I'll just assume you were. Surely you remember:  [Love is Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHTT__uvD2E)  [Who's Your Daddy (David Guetta Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paW71JgYFFI)  [Love Don't Let Me Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6e3R-aA2LA)  [Delerious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiG-TgYjHP8) Love the LBL remix too <3  [When Love Takes Over (Extended)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ySA3BOXZko)  Unfortunately, money was more important to him than making good music and we get the Guetta that we have now =/
McDreads	Yep, unfortunately Home depot doesn't carry large enough ubolts. I found a place where I can get them custom made though :). Lots of hoops and ladders for whats supposed to be a simple installation
McDreads	I implied that I would stop by McDonald's before the hike, but I do agree with you. Otherwise, why would you call it camping?? 😂😂😂
McDreads	Definitely not the healthiest thing you could be eating but calories are calories. Maybe if I for some reason forgot all my backpacking food or stove or something I would use McDonald's as a last resort
McDreads	Don't feed the wildlife.
McDreads	I'll give it a shot. The instructions that came with this are completely useless, unfortunately
McDreads	Has anyone had problems installing their Cabela's Trailgear 2 Rooftop Carrier? | I heard it mentioned a couple times on this subreddit so I decided to go ahead and purchase it.

McDreads	Amen to that. Unfortunately when these newer kids think of Armin, they think of his trousey and pop-EDM sound. They come to the conclusion that he became popular because of that cheesey sound and it fortifies their love for him and that new garbage that he's playing. 
McDreads	What are you talking about? Everyone is giving him shit on the DS FB group as well 😂
McDreads	It's his debut DJ set apparently and its most likely going to be an opening set, which I don't mind

McDreads	What are your favorite trance mixes/sets from 2008-2010? | This is around the time that I started listening to trance and is the sound I feel an immense sense of nostalgia to when I hear it. I do have a couple mixes but would love to hear more! So far, I have Armin's 6 hr set at Amnesia 2008, Armin's EDC 2010 Set, Armin @ ASOT 400 (2009), and all the ASOT top 20's from those years, Gareth Emery's Trance Energy 2010 set, Above & Beyond's EDC 2010 set, J00F Essential Mix 2010, PvD Amnesia 2008  So, any suggestions? :)

McDreads	Were you increasing weights every month and completing each set until failure?
McDreads	I can't stress how good Jeff's videos are from his Athlean-X channel! If you're going to work out, make sure you do it right! Proper form, avoid exercises that will do you more harm than good (It's crazy how often you will see this in the gym!!)  Also, download the [Bodyspace](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/fitness-apps.html) App and find a workout program that suits your liking. There are hundreds, if not thousands, to choose from. The one I've always been coming back to is Jim Stoppani's Shortcut to Size (apparently there's also an app for that but I just follow the program in the Bodyspace App). I like this program because it focuses on strength and size. I have seen so much muscle and strength gain because of this program, I'll be sticking with it for a while.  Depending on which program you choose, the app will tell you which parts of the body to work out, it will give you the exercises to do, the number of repetitions and sets, and you can save your weight/reps/sets to look back upon. Best of all, it's free. It's literally like having a personal trainer in your pocket!! I don't know why people spend crazy amounts of money when there's something like this.  The one downside to this app is that some programs will show exercises with bad form (i.e. Shoulder Front Raises with a pronated hand position) or exercises that you should never be doing (i.e. Upright Rows) and most never mention stretching or working the antagonist muscles (i.e. working the external rotators after doing chest day). This is why you should watch as many Athlean-X videos as you can (take his word as the GOLD STANDARD), then find a program in Bodyspace that suits you, and make the necessary modifications.  Best of luck on your fitness journeys everyone! Let me know if you have questions!  /u/jessew1987

It_Is_857AM	This is so true. I was explaining to my kid the other day that I grew up before there were cell phones and ipads. If you couldn't reach your friend by the home (longest cord in history) phone, then you hoped on your bike and rode over. We played outside from sunrise to sunset and it was awesome!

It_Is_857AM	The place I bought it from said I shouldn't be concerned about it. Said it should bud out in the spring. The tree does come with a 2 year warranty. Any opinions/advice would be appreciated.

JesteroftheApocalyps	I was living and working abroad, but when my work contract ended, I was searching for a new job. This was literally the year that Google started (1998).  Someone found my resume online and emailed me a job offer. I was ecstatic.  He told me I was invited to do a job interview to work on Mauritius Islands.  Of course I was excited. One of the most beautiful places on earth. My best friend was telling me, "You just landed a dream job!"  But he told me that the Mauritius government required that I pass a test involving Cruise ship safety and security.  I replied that I didn't apply for a Cruise Ship.  He replied that the government of Mauritius required this certification. And that I had to pay $500 for it.  I was living in a third-world country at the time. I knew that there was now way that Mauritius had harder, stricter regulations.  Then I used Google for the first time ever.  There was no such hotel on the island of Mauritius. Searching this guys contact information, as well as the website he instructed me to contact and submit my payment and take my "test" was already flagged as bogus.  So I backed away.

JesteroftheApocalyps	I'm old.   Back in my college days, in the early 90s, when I was desperate for money, I worked for Sprint, who had set up a "boiler room" of about 100 of us to cold call people and try to tell them to switch to Sprint on their landline accounts, then try to sell them a phone plan.  No shit, one of the incentive goals was whoever completed a sale got a soccer ball, but they had to throw it to someone else if they got a sale. The person with the ball by 5 p.m. got to keep the soccer ball.  I landed my only sale at like 4:50. the rest of the team was super pissed.  I got the ball and never showed back up.   I took a job night-cleaning a car dealership garage instead.

JesteroftheApocalyps	Several different types: coconut milk custards, soft jellies with suspensioned bits of harder multi-colored jellies, mung bean savoriries covered in Jasmine flavored syrup, something like egg-yolk thread cakes again drenched in a syrup.  It was really foreign to me, but my sous chef assured me that I had the best two Khmer dessert chefs in the country (1996) and just let them work those things. So I really didn't get into the nuts and bolts of their process, other than teaching them how to chill things faster and easier, as well as presentation.   TBH, everything tasted fine to me, but it wasn't my cup of tea. We got rave reviews from all the Khmers, so I didn't want to really fuck up whatever process they had.  Like "Whoah, hands off, let them do what they do and just tweak the presentation to international standards."  
JesteroftheApocalyps	That looks amazing!  Can I make a suggestion?  Shave (I mean go to the Asian market and get one of those cheap Japanese mandolins, they are the best)some red cabbage with the green cabbage, add a touch of grated carrot, and mix together. Just toss it in a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar, lime juice, a tsp of sugar, tsp of salt, and a smidge of black pepper. let it sit for an hour or so, then squeeze it out a little.  It's tasty, beautiful, and adds that dynamic that brings out the flavor of everything.It will rock that taco.
JesteroftheApocalyps	My son has every Nerf gun on the market.  We have both played Left 4 Dead 2 extensively.  Our neighborhood has massive Nerf gun wars.

JesteroftheApocalyps	You're absolutely right.   1: we own him. Based on his salary and career goal, we can work him out and make decisions based on a measured assessment of his commitment to rejoining the league and work ethic.   2: However things shake out, he ultimately has to prove himself to us first before anyone in the league would consider him. All the cards are on the Browns sitting on him until he proves his value.   3: Even if he we take our time to slowly bring him back into the fold, we have until October 31st to make a trade. so we have approximately 6 weeks to evaluate him if he gets reinstatement today.  4: Fuck the Steelers, Ravens, and Art Model should be [getting a pineapple shoved up his ass in hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42oucm_lj50) as we speak.  EDIT: I'm all for keeping him, seeing if he's in NFL shape, is willing to learn the offense, routes, etc. and not be a distraction. And of course staying off the icky sticky and proving he's committed to being a Brown or at least an NFL player. Ease him in slowly, however. Cody could suddenly become more useful in working him out a bit and teaching him the playbook.
JesteroftheApocalyps	I didn't realize he was injured. I was wondering why his play was limited. Last year he beasted the fuck out of Pouncey.  
JesteroftheApocalyps	You know your shit!  I was chef in Cambodia for 8 years.  I had a table made with Anxi Red Granite from China. My staff was pissed that I made the table A touch low ( loke 30-36"---I can't remeber, it was in metric!) because I knew they would have to make a lot of stuff by hand they would need to put body pressure down on the ingredients. And they were all 5'5" at the best.  Sure enough, they got it after working on that table.  It was huge (like 3 x 2 meters). We were making our own puff pastry, which had to be done at night. It was too hot and humid to crank out during the day. We also made our own nougat, chocolate decor, and chilled Cambodian desserts there. It was a lot of fun and hard work. I loved that table.
JesteroftheApocalyps	But indeed that marble was ice cold and dry.  You can even see the ice slab under the marble.  If the room isn't refrigerated, you have to work super fast because condensation will form on the marble and ruin your chocolate.  That guy is a pro. Work fast, hard, and with total precision. 
JesteroftheApocalyps	Thank you for correcting me. Double Ought or Triple Ought.  I think you're right though. 000 buck will hit at least 3 looters bunched up near a doorway. Probably lethal to one, but the "boom-stick" shock and the spread will cause a lot of fear and dis-motivation in an instant. Probably only need to shoot the shotgun once, then audibly re-rack it, movie-style. Then everyone not hit runs and goes to rob 7-11. You call 911 and ask them to come over, they say, "Sorry man. We're overloaded with calls, and you're in a flood zone. May take a couple hours."
JesteroftheApocalyps	Dude, as a fellow Browns fan,  I would never ask you to put away your bad feelings.   But the whole "going to another team and lighting up the league" thing is too much.  At least dial it down to "I'll believe it when I see it, then we'll see what happens".  We pretty much own his ass. If Hue and Sashi are confronted with his reinstatement, they're definitely going to give him a few weeks to prove himself, and prove to all of us he's really back.   It costs our salary cap practically nothing, and the entire league will be watching as well.

JesteroftheApocalyps	Reading your comment I think you overlooked Bitonio.  Crowell isn't any different than any running back in the league in that (of course) he needs running lanes. Emmitt Smith was a brilliant finisher on his runs, but he got a good 5-6 yard push from Larry Allen, Nate Newton, etc.  Like I said, Tretter is a huge concern.I can't understand why he wasn't an improvement.   I'm not going to bandwagon Joe, but he really held his ground and did his job. I watched him the whole game and I couldn't find a fault in the guy.  Like I said, I don't think it's talent, it's picking on Kizer. The Steeler defense spread out to force the Browns O-line to spread out. We never should have done that. Run it up the gut, and do some play-action. Force their linebackers to either commit to the run, or drop back.  Instead we opened up our line, we didn't run the ball, Kizer was indecisive, and pass coverage broke down.  Basically Hue put too much hope in Kizer to deliver. It didn't help that Britt and Coleman dropped passes or that Kizer was inaccurate AF, but Hue's entire game  plan rested on Kizer playing lights-out football, and that didn't happen.  Maybe I'm wrong, but we should have forced the Steelers to rely on edge rushers to defeat us by crushing things up the middle.  But we definitely need some better run blocking. My perception is that Hue Jacson is trying to preserve our offensive line instead of unleashing them. But if you have ever played the game, you know that you have to play forward and smash instead of trying to play like you're preserving yourself.
JesteroftheApocalyps	[Holy schnickies, that fact just blew my mind.](https://www.quora.com/Theres-no-letter-p-in-Arabic-so-how-do-they-pronounce-it) 
JesteroftheApocalyps	Not sure why you're getting DV'ed brother.  You hit the nail on the head.  But for real, Kizer had all day to check down and make decisions.   I agree with you that Tretter is a worrisome disappointment this first game. Our O-line needs some heavy adjustments.  One-on-one battles? Only JT and Bitonio to some extent showed their girth.  But a good O-line knows how to "clam up" and fill the gaps, know where your brother is on your left and right, and not worry about the edge.  Jt has his edge locked down. The right side needs TE help.  But these guys definitely don't have any chemestry.  And yeah, Kizer definitely needs to chuck it within 3 seconds. Or stop over-throwing receivers or lasering it to open guys.  Kizer did what he could to make plays for a rookie QB in his first game. IMHO the offensive game plan was a little too ambitious for his first day. I was begging for more Crowell and Duke to set up the play-action for short gains. Kind of how Green Bay used to just grind the fuck out of defenses with 6-8 yards a play.  But it seemed to me Hue was looking for go-routes and monster passes.  We aren't that kind of team yet. But we can definitely wear down the opposition, keep our D off the field to blow up the opposition, and *grind*.  Nothing flashy, just work out JT, Bitonio, and the RBs to set up gains in passing.   That's my 2 cents.

djleni	I'm more and more convinced they're actively trying to break the mobile site to encourage the app. 
djleni	Might I suggest breaking your code into separate files based on functionality? It's just about at the point where one file is too long.
djleni	>So I can log values as they are generated is the purpose of a debugger?   Not log them, just see them right then and there. With Visual Studio for example, you just mouse over a variable and it shows you the value. While the code is running.  >What is compile time? Working with Python, C#, and JavaScript I haven't come across this.    It doesn't apply to Python or JavaScript, but in C#, compile time is what happens when you click build. It takes your high level code and translates it to lower level bytecode.
djleni	If your error isn't compile time the IDE doesn't help worth shit.  The ability to step through the code and watch the values of variables can make or break your problem solving.
djleni	You read the first chapter of a microeconomics textbook and then stopped, I take it.
djleni	May I see it?
djleni	Yes, there's no way they'll be worse AFAIK.
djleni	I like a lot of his atomic thoughts but does anyone else feel like his lectures just jump all over the place with no structure or overall points?

djleni	Listen to the Funk Hunters and Chali 2na EP for some different but excellent vibes.
djleni	Yes. Yesss. Let the hate flow through you.
djleni	r/science *aggressively* removes comments that don't follow their rules.
djleni	Please do this. Even some of the people doing the best things they can for the world don't always feel appreciated.
djleni	Old? How many people here are young enough to not know what that means?!
djleni	This is a fun exercise but does anyone else think bad UX? I don't need to wait >1 second to watch an animation if something's loaded in milliseconds.
djleni	Exactly. Like I said, fun exercise :)
djleni	How do they plan on getting people to do this when I get a salary, in part, for this?  It'll have to be monetized somehow.
djleni	So where would the money to pay me for code reviews come from? Advertisement? Members fees?
djleni	>mixed with rice (10/10!)  heh.  
djleni	There's nothing wrong in mentioning that when bringing bad news.  "Hey, I understand you were trying to help us and I appreciate it immensely, but I thought you should know they did..."
djleni	You just said you felt bad!:) If you said that I don't think they'll have any negative feelings about you telling them.
djleni	HR takes literally 0 part in my company's interview process.
djleni	Then they should be tried like an individual when they break the law.
djleni	A million dollar fine does nothing to a large company.  No one severed jail time for the bad banking practices that led to recession.
djleni	Didn't see the racks till you I read that. I don't even think it's bad, I'm just jealous.
djleni	I'd say anything beyond a personal project requires knowledge of some DBMS.
djleni	I'd argue that you subconsciously give the person directions because helping others makes you feel good.
djleni	Some argue there is no such thing as a selfless act, and I tend to agree. A lot of good comes from people acting in self interest.
djleni	True, but writing fizzbuzz is quite different from writing an operating system.  I think it'd be reasonable for a problem to say expect 10-40 minutes or something.
djleni	I understand this but it's completely not what I'm getting at.  It'd be nice to know roughly how long a problem might take if I know I've got 30 minutes to spare, for example.
djleni	Have you tried Googling the problem or following a tutorial?  Not to be a jerk but this is like first day of programming stuff.

djleni	YouTube channel similar to SeamlessR, but house? | I love Seamless' videos, but they're not really the genre I want to produce lately.  Is there anyone else with such a plethora of sound design and track from scratch videos, but more along the lines of house?  Dirtybird / Night Bass type stuff?  Thanks!
djleni	Agreed. Even a class name would be much better.  Also to keep sanity I prefer to prepend any variable name that's a jQuery object with "$".
djleni	Thanks! I was under the assumption since it shared roots cutting it would kill one or both but that appears to not be the case. 
djleni	>Healthy plants like that put out a lot of pups, so I don't think it would be too hard to convince the owner to let you have one.  What do you mean by pups? Excuse my ignorance. They're both mine, so I'm free to do whatever. Just inexperienced.

djleni	Am I doing something wrong, or is there something I can do to make these sprouts root better? | 
djleni	Can I do that without damaging the sprout? At that point I feel like I might as well just move them to small individual pots :)
djleni	The other varieties I started seem to be rooting just fine.  These have a lot of leaf mass but their roots are barely grabbing hold.
djleni	Preparing myself for downvotes, but... isn't loving a Nexus phone because its smooth, fast, done right, and runs vanilla Android, so third parties haven't had a chance to screw it up a bit of an.... *Apple* mindset?   I kid, I kid! Seriously I think I've liked every Nexus product I've owned.
djleni	They said be gentle :) My company basically functions the same way but I know that isn't true of everywhere and its not *impossible* to get hired without a degree. Just much harder.
djleni	No, definitely not, but it will be far more difficult to prove to an employer you're worth their time without it.

djleni	Denver r/Subaru members... where's a good place to get a tune? | I think my girl is running a little rich. I just want a tune to run like stock or close to stock at this altitude, and don't know who is actually worth their salt at this sort of thing.  Ideally Lakewood, Littleton, or Centennial.  Or is it reasonable to do it myself with a some variety of OBD2 device?  Thanks!
djleni	I was looking into the window guards. I've got mud flaps and tint, but don't really want to lower due to my driveway :)
djleni	Why does yours look so much more aggressive than mine? 😞  Jealous.
djleni	Not at all. The gambler's fallacy is getting 10 heads in a row and then assuming the next one *must* be tails because it hasn't happened in a while.  Given 1 million tosses it's not a fallacy to say the probability of, *at some point*, getting two heads is higher than if you had 10 tosses.
djleni	You're doing God's work son.  "Always program as if the guy who will be maintaining your code is an axe murderer who knows where you live." Or something to that effect.

djleni	http://www.nand2tetris.org/ is excellent.
djleni	Long term goals... is there something I can do in CS that's humanitarian? | I love my current job and have other prospects, but it doesn't have that... *worthwhile* feel to it.  Don't get me wrong, I love programming; I could write code for something I couldn't care less about and still enjoy it a good chunk of the time.  In the long run, however (after I've become financially stable, paid of student loans, bought a house, etc.), I'd really like to move to something that feels meaningful. Humanitarian if you will.  Do opportunities like this exist within our field? Ideally, opportunities without taking a huge pay cut?  It might be better to just do that sort of thing on the side (i.e. volunteer work at schools), which is why I'm asking :)
djleni	Let's operate under the assumption I want to *do* something, not just give money.  > hard mode: Have kids  LOL

djleni	The idea is fine, but what's the incentive? People don't like doing things unless they benefit them, so registering on a website in order to spend time giving a review seems pretty unlikely to get any momentum.  That's why things like Google Play Rewards (they pay you in store credit for answering surveys) exist.  Without incentive people don't really give feedback unless something is out-of-the-ordinary good or bad.
djleni	Ideally the square holes from manufacturer.

djleni	2011 STI fog light lenses? | I was cleaning my car the other day and noticed that the lens one of my fog lights looks like it got hit by a rock and cracked.  After a quick Google all I found for replacements were full assemblies.  Is there anywhere I can purchase just the lens?
djleni	> It's simply the first time I've been trying to make my code "DRY" and thought, "is this redundant?"  You're doing it right :) If you find yourself copy/pasting, there's almost always a better option.  >strange habit of wrapping chunks of code that due one specific task into functions  This isn't strange, in fact, this is exactly what you should be doing. I'm impressed you've acquired that habit without being told to.  A good way to think about it is "Does this function just do one thing?". If it's doing a whole lot of stuff, it's worth at least considering breaking it up.  Now, don't get carried away either. In your above example, it'd be bad to do:      function assignVar(variable, value) {         variable = value;     }      function checkClass($object, class) {         return $object.hasClass(class);     }      $('input').on('keyup change', function() {         if (checkClass($(this), 'height')) {             assignVar(height, $(this).val());         } else if (checkClass($(this), 'weight')) {             assignVar(weight, $(this).val());         }     }  Now, say you had two or three very specific inputs that needed this functionality, it's be an EXCELLENT idea to wrap this bit of code in a function, to be DRY:      function assignHeightOrWeight($input) {         if ($input.hasClass('height')) {             height = $(this).val();         }         else if ($input.hasClass('weight')) {             weight = $(this).val();         }         else {             alert("Error grabbing input value(s)");         }     }      $('input#special1').on('keyup change', function() { assignHeightOrWeight($(this)) });     $('input#special2').on('keyup change', function() { assignHeightOrWeight($(this)) });     $('input#special3').on('keyup change', function() { assignHeightOrWeight($(this)) });     $('input#special4').on('keyup change', function() { assignHeightOrWeight($(this)) });
djleni	>This isn't very dry... So I went ahead and made some adjustments:             var $input  = $('input');       var height = '';       var weight = '';            function getVal() {         $input.on('keyup change', function(){           if ($(this).hasClass('height')) {             height = $(this).val();           }           else if ($(this).hasClass('weight')) {             weight = $(this).val();           }           else {             alert("Error grabbing input value(s)");           }         })       }  TBH this is a bad example for DRY, but yes, it almost is always better. It doesn't matter so much for little personal projects, but on a large codebase it basically always has benefits down the road.  None of this really needs to be wrapped in its own function: it seems like you think you need the on event to be wrapped in a function, but using on in jQuery assigns the event handler. Imagine an event handler as a variable, whose value is a function that is called when something happens. Written this way, your on change won't be attached as an event handler until you call getVal().  Like I said, you don't need the outer function, but to name it what it's actually doing it would be called setInputOnChange().  Your second option is best, just remove the outer function getVal(). 
djleni	In my honest opinion, if you're asking this question, don't even bother.   That isn't supposed to read in a mean way either. By time you're tracks are good enough for mastering to be worth your time or money, you'll know the answer.
djleni	To elaborate: I paid for mastering once before my mixdowns were even reasonable. The guy was honestly really nice about it and gave me some pointers before he even touched it.  But the end result was just a polished turd. I don't even bother with mastering beyond some limiting and soft clipping, and some general mid side EQ and my tracks sound 1000 times better than that one.  One day, when I'm getting signed, I *might* consider it again.
djleni	How much do you know about software, or encryption?  And if the NSA can do it why do they need to ask Apple at all?

djleni	Fired at 65, options? | Hello,  I'm asking this question for a friend that's in a rough situation; let's call him John.  John was fired without much reason, and the only justification being one documented argument with a superior a few months ago.  John is 65 years old, and it sure looks a lot like age discrimination in order to get a younger employee with a lower salary. He had been with the company for over a decade without incident. The company is a very large, known-for-bureaucracy company that sells to the government.  John worked with real time systems, programming in primarily C, and was a senior software architect.  Clearly, he intends to contact a lawyer to see if there are any legal options to pursue.  Is there any hope for John as far as finding a new job at 65? He doesn't have enough saved to retire, so the timing is pretty awful.

mrsam12000	"Magic Power can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred," said Thillred. "And the more you have, the more others lost."   You remembered the decades of meticulous training, sprinting through the desert, weeks-long meditations sheltered beneath the umber rocks that blushed orange in the double sunset. Even with Thillred's intense mentoring, you could barely levitate a pebble.   And then, one dusky twilight, as you sat fireside with Thillred, a force, white-hot, intense as lightning but spiked with shouts of horror, knocked you 10 feet away. Thillred nursed you through three weeks of semi-consciousness and surreal, hideous dreams. But you returned, strong beyond imagining.  "Every living being is entrusted with a droplet of Magic Power," said Thillred, struggling to understand. His dark, worried eyes scanned the heavens. "There are many planets, many galaxies."  A 30-ton boulder easily slid from its socket in the earth as your Magic lifted it. But those terrible discordant voices returned, too, audible only to yourself. The boulder crashed to the ground as you remembered your first coherent words after your delirium:  "I felt a great disturbance in the Magic, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."

mrsam12000	What are the most wonderful and the most terrible things about Reddit? | 
mrsam12000	* Wonderful: The number of people on AskReddit now is about seven times the population of my town.  * Terrible: Subs can be a soapbox for pretty awful statements/traits.
mrsam12000	* Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) of The Andy Griffith Show and Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. He was a mild foil to Mayberry's neighborly innocence.  * Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) from the Pink Panther series. The best gag stunts I've ever seen. Clouseau is a moron who miraculously always lands on his feet. Sellers was great as another idiot eccentric in "Being There".
mrsam12000	They tried to cram too much into the first movie, IMO. The series didn't have the same familiarity in America as Harry Potter.
mrsam12000	Symphonic metal. It's operatic and cinematic but crunches. It shouldn't be the sole province of metal heads. Nightwish & Within Temptation are two great ones.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	What is the weirdest situation you've woken up to? | 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	As a kid, I woke up in a cardboard box in the basement.  Apparently there had been a thunderstorm and a tree outside my window had been struck by lightning, spraying the wall next to my bed with chunks of tree.  Just in case said tree fell on my room while I was sleeping, my parents took me into the basement and put me in a giant cardboard box.  I slept through it all. . .
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My parents were out of state, so I was staying at my best friend's house on 9/11. My first reaction was "We should call my parents, I don't think they'll be flying home today. . ."
MasterOfMasksNoMore	How hard losing someone you've just met can be. I met my wife's grandfather who told her "I'm waiting to meet him before I go. . ."  He died holding my hand less than an hour after I met him. We met eyes once, maybe twice. Never spoke a word. . .   The kicker? He waited until everyone else went to the other room to get coffee.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Crying, in my mind, does not signify weakness. You, my friend, are no bitch. Own it. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Good stuff.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I cried, a lot.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I did something similar. All change, 1's, and 5's in my bag at the end of the night I pocketed before tips were calculated and dropped them in a bucket at home. I bought a monitor, and several nice new outfits with the ones after about 8 months.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Legend of Legaia.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I did this to myself - ride home from the autoshop. Only 5 miles, but the route was all hills, and it was nearing winter. Big kick to the ego. I felt like I almost killed myself. I wish I had some advice on how to make it feel better, but in my experience, time works just fine. Relish the embarassment of walking like an idiot and "walk it off." 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I met my wife on OkCupid. Happily married for 3.5 years so far.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Talk to him. Not an easy subject, I know, but talk to him. Ask for support, whatever that looks/feels like to you.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Oldboy
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My father, my uncle, and I | My father and uncle (dad's brother) were diagnosed with Parkinson's several years ago. I never really looked into the disease myself, because I was scared, because my cousin told me that there was a gene that increased the likelihood by 3%. Now, having JUST started looking into everything, it turns out that I, at 29, have possibly been exposed to many of the risk factors of Parkinson's that my Dad has, and may be experiencing some early symptoms, psychosematic, (I've been under a good bit of stress lately) or not, myself. I'm sure there is plenty of info I'll be checking out in the sidebar, but any additional info would be appreciated. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My brother's long-term girlfriend was a traveling nurse that did/does in-home wound care. The local university offered her free tuition to get her PHD. She now teaches with a specialty in elderly wound care, I think. Very intersting, and I would think rare. It's not often you have someone who lights up when talking about open puss-ridden wounds. She's an incredible person, mother, and friend. I'd love to sit in on a few of her classes, though I'm not in the medical field, myself.

MasterOfMasksNoMore	When I was a boy I skinned my knee cap to the bone running in sandals. There were not big enough Band-Aids, so my grandparents used tape and paper. I think I was 5. Thinking back now, they probably should have taken to me to the hospital, or it wasn't really to the bone and they told me to make me feel like a badass.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My daughter(step) is a very fearful girl. It make me physically hurt when she is scared or feels she needs to cry about things that I judge to be to totally insignificant. Her biological father makes her watch all kinds of horror movies that she doesn't want to.and treats her like a posession, not a person. It drives me crazy. I've lost count of the number of times that I've held her in my arms and cried with her. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Someone walking by my open dorm room door, then spoiling the largest plot twist in the movie 30 seconds before it happens by asking "Isn't that the movie where the dude and the chick. . .". This happened to me with Oldboy.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I did this on my first Survival playthrough. Combine this with Ghoulish, And you can drink irradiated water all day to get your health up, while the Rads are healed at the same time. My current playthrough is much harder - I maxed Charisma to start.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	If I remember correctly, we also consume more energy on aveage than other countries, so likely even less that.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M A BEAR! I SUCK THE HEADS OFF FISH!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I'm superbly excited for your new show. Thank you.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This and You Kill Me are two of my favorite assassin movies. . .
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Fallout 4 and Broodwar. The result? A Fallout RTS with more Aliens, , or a chem-addicted, stickeyfingered, smart-mouthed Starcraft Ghost FPS with RPG elements. Please, Blizzard/Bethesda, make either of these happen.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I totally support you going full-time with this. With what's happening with advertising on the platform, sponsorships and Patreon seem like the only way to reliably make money on YouTube. I say go for it, but only if you're not going to be dependant on the AdSense revenue from the videos. Granted, a cooking show isn't that controvertial, but things keep changing rapidly. . . 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Not bad, indeed. My wife and I had a short talk last night on how he's the first Spidey to really get the awkwardness of Peter Parker down pat. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I almost tried to do this last night with my wife. I want it over and done with. So far it's just basically been a reenactment of some of the things that she went through in HS that led her to multiple attempts. Thankfully gang rape is missing so far. The reasons I keep watching it are that my wife is getting to process a lot of the terrible shit she went through and talk about it with me, and some of it is news to me, so I'm really glad to be watching it with her.  Before cellphones, there were poloroids. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My thoughts exactly.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I'm not worried. I have faith in you.   I can empathize with your situation. Part of my wife's childhood was similar in some ways to what you're experiencing. It was a hard road for her, but she's an amazing mother of 3 now.   Thank you.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I see a lot of great advice here. So all I'll ask is for an update on your situation when you feel up to it. You'll be in our thoughts.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This disgusts me. These types of videos should be some of the most well-supported on the platform.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	"SUPER GREEN!"
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I fell for my wife before we ever met. We've been married for over 3 years now.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I'd prefer this. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	>That's slam dunk rape.   I hope to never see or hear that sentence again. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/MillionaireMakers
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I just read this to my wife. I knew after the first few sentences that I had to. Thank you for sharing. It isn't easy to lose a love like that. However, I believe you can find it again. What do you believe?
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Not in the arm!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	How long is that class period? O.o
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My wife can barely watch that, though it's one omy all-time favorites. She lost her best friend to an IED. He was a bomb tech, on his way to defuse it.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Priest of Titania?
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I love the foundation bit. Sadly, I think a lot of people wouldn't make that connection.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	One thing I've noticed over the years is that singers for bands that aren't recognized further than something like "Well, that guy screams good. . . But that's not talent! They aren't a singer!" Have no idea the level of training it takes to be able to keep doing that year after year.  I'm no singer, nor a greasemonkey, but I think of it as being able to keep a car's engine running well and cleanly while driving like a maniac in stop and go traffic well beyond the life of a normal engine. . . And lots of people still look at your car and go "That's a pretty shit car."
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I really need to sit down with a pair of headphones and listen to music for a few days straight to catch up on all the music I've missed out on. These days I catch an album or single here and there.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Not only that, but he's able to say "Fuck it, I'll show them!" And sing the shit out of a classic song like Sound of Silence and effectively silence those that think he can't sing. My 67 year-old mother teared up the first time she heard it. I'll be honest, so did I. I grew up with Disturbed, the Beatles, The Pointer Sisters, Simon and Garfunkel, Stabbing Westward, Eminem, etc. ... all bending my ear.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Haven. That was fast!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Congrats! My next child will likely be foster/adopted due to likely complications of our future pregnancies and I'm super excited. It'll be a few years, though. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Reminds me of Max Payne for some reason.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	7th or 17th?
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I was a bit of an asshole when I met my wife. I was okay with being single. . . Finally. I was messaging 1-2 women a week, and kept up conversations when I got responses. I knew I'd find someone, but I approached it all as very detached, in a Law of Averages kind of way -- Interested, but well aware that things would likely go South. Things became obvious when I met my wife, and I stopped a FWB arrangement with someone to pursue the relationship.   Being single sucks a lot most of the time, but when it doesn't, it's amazing. Find those amazing bits if you can.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	The eyes and mouth can tell you a lot.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I acted in a school play in which I had 70 plus percent of the lines. One of the people who attended the show has remarked about my performance every time I've seen her in the last 10 years. Who knows, in 15 years, I may pursue acting.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Having just found Trap Nation a few months ago... I'm super pissed. Love the music.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Or [this](https://youtu.be/hHkKJfcBXcw) has been a long time coming.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Let that fear be fuel.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	What do you feel you need to do? Use it for that. You be the judge.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	When I run in 2024, I fully intend on doing something like this. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Welp, thank you. I'll be honest, I didn't pay much attention to grammar, but I have spent a small bit of time doing public speaking.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Did I miss something or is that two sentences?
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Beat me to it. My wife hadn't seen it.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This is why there are companies like [Children in Film](http://www.childreninfilm.com) exist. A lot, if not all Hollywood productions have to have a lot of documentation from families of child actors that compaines like Children in Film help to get everything in order. There's a LOT of stuff that's involved. Shows like The Voice will have dozens of kids they need to get everything set up for in a short period of time, so things can get really crazy when it comes to deadlines. An ex of mine used to work with Children in Film from time to time, and the sheer volume of work involved in these instances that were sometimes very hard to orchestrate in the short period of time given. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My wife, daughter and I are looking forward to playing this when we getback home!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I found out about them by having really shit aim the first time I played with the minigun and dying from the explosion.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Typically, on Survival I tried to level up in Sanctuary to at least level 5. To answer your question, yes. Blow up the cars to get it lower, and possibly cripple it's legs. The it's belly time! Hide in the first floor of one of the businesses it can't get into and plink away until you're basically out of ammo.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This. I have a few people who used to be in my life that are not any longer, even though they were some of my closest friends for almost 20 years.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I had a drunk naked guy chase me down the hall of a hotel on a delivery once years ago. A young lady in a towel answered the door. Very awkward.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Perhaps you could share this "command" (otherwise know as sorcery) you speak of. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Try a no Power Armor run. I prefer running without it, myself. The only thing I really use it for is the extra carry weight for major supply runs.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Currently the only one working in a family of 4, soon to be 5. I'm making a low enough monthly income to qualify for assistance with premiums, and the rest of my family are on Medicaid. If I were to be presented with the opportunity of a 30% raise, most, if not all of that money would have to go to isurance premiums to keep my family insured, likely with worse benefits than we currently have.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My wife and I have figured out that we've had at least half a dozen near-meets in our lives before we met online.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Not an expert, but from the progess reports that they give out at parent teacher conferences, my daughter (in 2nd grade) was reading at start of 6th grade level a few months ago. She's been talking since she was 4 months old. She's been progressing on this scale I mentioned earlier by 1.5-2 grades per year for the last 3 years.  If memory serves, there are 3 categories that are evaluated, then distilled into a single value. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This is my favorite music video of the few that I've seen in ths past few years. Another favorite of mine that comes to mind is [Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice](https://youtu.be/XQ7z57qrZU8) with Christopher Walken.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Almost 7 million views in a week. Not bad!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Let us know how it goes. I conviced a girl (a single mother, herself) to meet me for tea to meet for the first time. I swore it wasn't a date.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Not everyone reports the data.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Thanks for making me cry. Again. I do every time I watch this.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	How do you not have all the achievements?
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I had this one ruined for me 30 seconds before the big reveal by someone walking by my open dormroom door and saying. . . "Hey, isn't that the movie where the dude _____________(insert largest 3 word spoiler possible here) etc.?"   Eric, I forgive you... but... FUCK, man...!  
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This is the kind of news thah can bring a tear to my eyes. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I'm in a similar situation with my 7 year old (step)daughter. He doesn't put his hands on her that I am aware of, but she has many dibilitating fears that stem directly from him intentionally trying to scare her. He's a master manipulator, and has a young, disabled girlfriend who, in my judgement, he is using for money. It's so frustrating because we don't have the funds to take him to court to get custody. We're stuck playing his games for now.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Been together 3 years 3 months, married 2 and a half years.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	This reminds me a lot of my wife and I. We both feel this way about each other. I proposed 12 days after we started dating. Not letting this one go.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	My first attempt had me at lvl 52 with Meteorain before leaving Midgar. . .
MasterOfMasksNoMore	[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for Windows users. It can be used for small QOL improvements, such as autocompleting your email address anywhere, or MUCH more. I use it for work to decrease time spent on certain tasks on the web from 5-10 minutes to 10-15 seconds.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	It still is used for game stuff a lot. I don't, I'm more attracted to the crazy stuff you can do with it.  Tom Scott used it with his crazy creation [The Emoji Keyboard]( https://youtu.be/lIFE7h3m40U). That's just scratching the surface of the possibilites.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	There Is something [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) though I cannot say how similar it is. I myself am hoping to make the switch to Linux once and for all, so I'll have to learn to Bash etc. >.< i'll definitely miss AHK when/if I switch.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I want a Moto Slivr of an Android phone. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I think I might be able to make this one!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Toast Masters is awesome. Great times were had there.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I was you. Now I'm married with soon to be 3 kids. I'm still a bit of an ass at times, but I'm working on it. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	In my eyes, you're on the right track. I was on a similar track when I met my wife.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	12 days.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	That's fucked up.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	[Help] Enable/Disable Profiles with Names that contain specific text. | [Solved]  Hello r/Tasker! I'm working on making my Tasker setup more efficient by expanding on my "Status" profiles. Currently, if I have all of my profiles enabled, my phone will not dial out for 2-5 minutes. Based on the value of %Status, I want to turn on/off all profiles that contain a specific substring in their Profile Name. Unfortunately, I can only find global variables that contain active or enabled Profiles.  An example of what I'm looking to achieve is below.      ; %Plist would be full list of all named profiles separated by commas.     1. Variable Set %statcheck to Dr- ; Not driving profiles check     2. Variable Set %split to %Plist     3. Variable Split %split  Splitter ,     4. Array Pop %split position 1 to %check ; remove first blank     5. Array Pop %split position 1 to %check      6. Stop if %check is not set.     7. If %check contains (~R) %statcheck     8. If %check contains (~R) -     9. Profile Status %check Off     10. Else If %check contains (~R) +      11. Profile Status % check On     12. GoTo Action 5 if %check is set.  I would use %PENABLED, but that won't work when I'm trying to re-enable Profiles. 
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Thank you!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	Thank you!
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I'm new and experiencing this now. Also, scanning shit to get off Mars took me days. Rather than farm Rhino, I made a friend who had a clan with Banshee researced. She'll be done in 2 days. I've got my Paris Prime, and don't need much else for where I'm at just yet.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	If those were Shapton. . . That may very well be just for one of the stones. I'vs sharpened on them at a show years ago. I want a set, but my family's needs come before my desire for stupidly sharp tools.
MasterOfMasksNoMore	I was one years ago.
europe050	What do a lot of parents do to screw up their child? | 
europe050	Seen that before! Sucks
europe050	Yup. Shitty parenting
europe050	I agree. Some things in life can't be taught, you have to make some of your mistakes on your own.
europe050	Do elaborate.
europe050	Interesting.
europe050	What makes absolutely 0% sense to you? | 
europe050	What should you not fuck with? |

europe050	You dodged a bullet right there buddy! 
europe050	If.
europe050	I was waiting for this answer haha.
europe050	Isn't changing company possible for you?
europe050	Maybe not in askreddit.
europe050	Made me chuckle too :D
europe050	There's every queston already been asked in some shape of form. It's the answers that are different!
europe050	Oh yes. When quiet people snap, they fucking snap.
europe050	You're probably right.
europe050	And hippos.
europe050	What's wrong with poor people?
europe050	They can make your day really bad without you even knowing it. So true

europe050	Oh. What's your most liked one?
europe050	I see.
europe050	A lot of people who are pros are shit interactors and vice versa. If you can interact with people & are sick in what you do, then twitch is perfect.
europe050	Actually there are theories that universe is actually not infinity. So it's even more fucked up than you might think haha
europe050	Elaborate!
europe050	With smaller twitch channels, people most likely feel like they are just chilling with friend!
europe050	Hang on there buddy!!:)
europe050	I produce edm music. I understand what you're trying to say perfectly haha
europe050	Hmm. Provoking thought:P
europe050	Care to elaborate?:)
europe050	Holy shit. Why is it embarrasing?
europe050	Positive thinking.
europe050	Haha
europe050	Can you name a few?
europe050	Haha brilliant answer!
europe050	Al capone agrees.
europe050	Damn ukrainans!

europe050	Check out rsdtyler on youtube!  EDIT: Elliott Hulse is sick channel too
europe050	Before that there were a lot of chain emails :D same bs, just different platform. But I agree, its so stupid

europe050	How to Make Crème Brûlée  Ingredients * 1 quart heavy cream * 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped * 1 cup vanilla sugar, divided * 6 large egg yolks * 2 quarts hot water Directions * Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  * Place the cream, vanilla bean and its pulp into a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cI over and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use.   * In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually. Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes.   * Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup vanilla sugar equally among the 6 dishes and spread evenly on top. Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top. Allow the creme brulee to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.

europe050	Perfect pancakes recipe  Ingredients 100g plain flour 2 eggs 300ml semi-skimmed milk 1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for frying pinch salt  Method * Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into the middle. Pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.   * Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream.   * Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.

europe050	Coping with Depression  Tips for Overcoming Depression One Step at a Time.  Tip 1: Reach out and stay connected  When you’re depressed, the tendency is to withdraw and isolate. Even reaching out to close family members and friends can be tough. Compound that with the feelings of shame and the guilt you may feel at neglecting your relationships. But social support is absolutely essential to depression recovery. Staying connected to other people and the outside world will make a world of difference in your mood and outlook. And if you don’t feel that you have anyone to turn to, it’s never too late to build new friendships and improve your support network.  Tip 2: Do things that make you feel good  In order to overcome depression, you have to do things that relax and energize you. This includes following a healthy lifestyle, learning how to better manage stress, setting limits on what you’re able to do, and scheduling fun activities into your day.  Tip 3: Move vigorously during the day  When you’re depressed, just getting out of bed can seem like a daunting task, let alone working out! But excersise is a powerful depression fighter - and one of the most important tools in your recovery arsenal. Research shows that regular exercise can be as effective as medication for relieving depression symptoms. It also helps prevent relapse once you’re well. To get the most benefit, aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. This doesn’t have to be all at once—and it’s okay to start small. A 10-minute walk can improve your mood for two hours.

ismelldirti	The client should get a logout option without fully closing the client | It would be so much easier if you could come back to the login screen instead of fully closing the client. This way when you want to play with other friends you can hop accounts way faster, or when you know you'll be coming online again later during the day you can just keep the login screen there instead of having to fully open the client again.

cherrychapsticc	Funhaus becomes a government. What responsibilities do the members have?
cherrychapsticc	Thank you! Nice username ;)
cherrychapsticc	Great YA stories with nice romance? I'm a sucker for cheesy romance accompanied with a good story | Bonus if it's fantasy
cherrychapsticc	I'm FINALLY getting an appointment for medication, after waiting a year or so. | I'm pretty excited and nervous. I'm nervous of the side effects, but excited to hopefully be able to, well, function. Is there anything in particular I should know before going through with this?
cherrychapsticc	People who have had plastic surgery, what was your experience like before and after? | 
cherrychapsticc	Like all generations before us, being obsessed with really uninportant things and eventually growing up and focusing on the more important things in life. Only difference is we can be really productive with this on the internet
cherrychapsticc	Lo-fi jazz works wonders for me when I do homework. There's a few 24/hr livestreams of it specifically for studying on youtube
cherrychapsticc	Me too, everything seems conflicting and my mind is in constant turmoil
cherrychapsticc	Having a significant other. It's really not an achievment (looking at you facebook users).
cherrychapsticc	As a girl I find this to be a very attractive trait in a guy. Self care in general is attractive as hell 
cherrychapsticc	I wish I lived in one

cherrychapsticc	"I'll take away MY laptop from you," is the go-to threat from my dad, even when I've clearly explained how irrational his argument has been and how taking it away won't change anything. It's infuriating and it used to get taken away a lot. Things have calmed down a little now that I'm older though. 
cherrychapsticc	Shiba inus and corgis 
cherrychapsticc	nah just reposted lmao
cherrychapsticc	I've actually learned a lot from Reddit, it's helped me with my personal life a great deal. And reading through askreddit and such usually exposes me to new ideas which then makes me research something interesting.

I feel like I'm the centre of the universe, cause everything I experience is all I'll ever know and I can't tell for sure if everyone else is the same.   I like to identify as an optimistic nihilist. Nothing really matters but I still might as well make this the most enjoyable and fulfilling experience for myself, if I'm supposed to die at some point. 
cherrychapsticc	[LPT request] What are some healthy ways to get over someone you once really cared about? | I'm pretty sure I'm not handling losing a best friend very well. It's very easy to get into a negative mind space whenever I think about them, which is all the time, and I'd really just like some peace of mind about this.
cherrychapsticc	thank you, i'll try
cherrychapsticc	Seconding this
cherrychapsticc	I'm not entirely sure what I just got but thank you!
cherrychapsticc	Educational systems not updating their curriculum, and students having more and more work to do. Just most systems in general are awful and do far more harm than good to everyone in the system.

cherrychapsticc	What's it like living with your mental disorder? Is there something you wish people knew? | 
cherrychapsticc	Is there anything I can say or do when a teacher is, well, shit at being a teacher? I feel I can't say to their face that I have an issue with how they're teaching without them getting really defensive and angry. (Teacher I have in mind has a stick up her ass all the time)
cherrychapsticc	Toph crying? Nah. I definitely see her being a little sad but knowing her, she'd bottle it up real good and tough through it. She'd probably mutter something like "we sure had a great run huh twinkletoes," 
cherrychapsticc	I'm fully aware of that, I try to be polite to teachers and such, but my entire class feels the same way. The teacher (and a couple others) just are really are awful, in terms of getting annoyed when someone doesn't understand something and being impatient and basically expecting everyone to know everything 100% off the bat. I was just wondering if there was possible at all for me to actually do something.
cherrychapsticc	My dad's fucking social awkwardness, anger issues, and stubbornness, alone with a few other unattractive personality traits. I hate it, it drives me up the wall especially since I see it on him every day and then I notice it in myself from time to time. 
cherrychapsticc	what it feels like to chew 5 gum
cherrychapsticc	"Stop talking to me like I'm a child!" My ex-friend says to me as I try to explain as clearly as possible how inconsiderate, rude and manipulative she was being and calling her out on all the lies and excuses she was giving. She really, really was acting like a child though. Ironically, she has a huge ddlg fetish.
cherrychapsticc	This one girl I know goes through a lot of mini "phases", like little behavioural quirks she'll pick up now and then. She started using full-stops (periods), and other symbols as well as trying to be as grammatically correct as possible while texting. But you see, before this she was a very, very sloppy texter. What's funny is, she still makes dumb grammatical mistakes, while trying to be grammatically correct. It's pretty entertaining to watch in the group chat that she's in.
cherrychapsticc	Not to mention running is great if you have ADHD. It clears a cloudy mind, or slows down a racing one at least. And you'll get a bit of extra dopamine 
cherrychapsticc	Honestly, everything. Especially our people's mental health and the educational system, which feeds into it. And our inability to fucking recycle anything. People hide used nappies in cardboard boxes, then put them in the recycling bin.   And our entire country has a drinking problem. 
cherrychapsticc	Yeah... AP classes..... easy..... yeah..... ok.....
cherrychapsticc	Can I have some advice on how to manage my hobbies? | I'm 16 and I love drawing, animating, and playing piano. Those would be my top three hobbies, I'm a beginner in all of them though. Which is fine, I enjoy learning..   But my brain doesn't? I get all inspired to draw something cool or sit and get a good session of piano in but everything suddenly seems incredibly boring and suddenly I don't even wanna do it anymore. And then I feel horrible about myself because I can't even be productive in my hobbies. I've so much drive to do something amazing but my brain just will not cooperate at all.. Only on the rare occasion.  Progress with them is so slow, I feel like I'm just being lazy but trying to actually get something done just feels like such a drag. Hobbies are supposed to be fun and relaxing, yet they seem to just be a constant battle for me... A battle of trying to ignore my brain wanting to do nothing but browse reddit and watch youtube...  I'm on a waiting list to get medication, but I'm not sure I can trust that it'll actually work. My mom tried medication (she also has adhd) and she hated the side effects. What will I do if medication doesn't work? Is there anything I can do to make just even doing things I enjoy less painful? It's awfully depressing   TL;DR I love my hobbies but actually doing anything with them feels like a drag to the point where they're not even enjoyable. I've picked up new hobbies before and experimented with new things, and they're fun for a while and then it just gets stagnant. What can I do?
cherrychapsticc	LPT: If you are feeling unmotivated, find one small task that needs doing and do it. Sometimes just getting the ball rolling has a snowball effect. | [removed]
cherrychapsticc	bsg to be continued | 
cherrychapsticc	Thank you, I'll try :')
cherrychapsticc	I have a piano teacher actually, and completing the homework she gives me can be quite an issue, haha.  But yes that makes sense! I'll try and structure my day a little more, cause I really don't have that much structure at the moment, with summer holidays and stuff. Thank you for your comment!
cherrychapsticc	But what if I keep trying and trying and failing so many times, knowing perfectly well I have the capability of doing it but it just isn't happening without tons of painful work? And then I hate myself for not being able to power through it. I'm tired of everything being a constant struggle
cherrychapsticc	I have the exact same problem with my hobbies, it's very very distressing. I can barely get anything done and it just makes me feel horrible about myself.   I haven't tried any medication yet (I'm on a waiting list...) so maybe there's still hope for me, but I'm terrified it wont help me..
cherrychapsticc	I've no idea, dunno how it works either lmao
cherrychapsticc	i know!! im pretty pissed
cherrychapsticc	My first animation, it's not much but I like it | 
cherrychapsticc	Baby Driver
cherrychapsticc	my first animation, not much but I think it's cute! | 
cherrychapsticc	Lead me and my friend on while she was in a relationship, cheated on that relationship and a past one, wouldn't leave the guy alone when he left her shitty ass, guy went back to her for some reason and she's manipulative and emotionally abusive, throws tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants, he tried to break up with her again she threatened to kill herself, now they're still together for some reason even though she lies like there's no tomorrow.   The guy here is not too shitty, he's nice, but this girl can fuck right off. It took ages for me to walk away from her and then this guy, who was one of my closest friends. I don't need this bs in my life.   Makes me feel better when I see her being the cringy stereotypical 'gamer girl'. She acts 13 yet she's 18. She's really just embarrassing herself on her social media at this point. 
cherrychapsticc	Mario kart but for PC
cherrychapsticc	Small acts of pettiness. I will fuck you up 
cherrychapsticc	Thinking a cheater (who already cheated on you once and on her previous boyfriends) won't cheat on you again so you give her a second chance.   It's gonna happen buddy
cherrychapsticc	I'd go through a thousand rejections and humiliations if it meant ending up with someone who was worth all of it. Cause that's what that amazing person will be; worth it
cherrychapsticc	Toxic people exist and they'll hurt you and the people you love and sometimes you can't do shit about it   Fuck you kayla 
cherrychapsticc	Stubble on guys' faces. My exes would let it grow out a little just for me (before shaving again so it didn't get too bad) and I just think it's the cutest thing. I could stroke it for hours, and I love how it tickles my face when we kiss 
cherrychapsticc	Irish person here. Glad ye left us the fuck alone in the end.... mostly 
cherrychapsticc	Man I can relate, my productivity is all over the place and I've no idea where I'm going in life and I'm just trying not to waste my time on like Reddit and YouTube.   Don't be so hard on yourself though, yeah shit is tough especially with ADHD but if no one else can support you, you gotta support yourself. Don't beat yourself up for having trouble doing certain things. Accept it and work on just trying your best. Sometimes simply having a more positive mindset can help tremendously.   Take things one at a time. Grab a journal and write down in bullet points things you wanna get done. Write out your goals and just practicing working towards them a little bit every day. And yeah some days you're gonna do absolutely nothing. Treat these as rest days, and just focus on minding yourself. Don't forget to take time to pamper yourself.   Work on the little things first. Being tired makes everything harder so give yourself a time to be in bed at and stick to it as best you can. If you can't fall asleep, read a book. Stay off your phone though cause the light just makes it harder to become tired.   I'm in a bit of a rush writing all this I apologise 
cherrychapsticc	Literally anything you want cause everything's free on the internet if you know how to pirate properly 
cherrychapsticc	What are some of the most helpful resources you'd recommend to a beginner? I'm gonna jump into the deep end and mess around in adobe animate (I've got premier too for editing). Any tips and tricks?
cherrychapsticc	Sociopathic manipulating people who just cause more harm than happiness. 
cherrychapsticc	Ain't no rest for the wicked 
cherrychapsticc	People keep telling me to pursue my interests, but I just don't really know how I'd do that because I don't feel particularly passionate about them. But there are also too many things I want to do, I just don't know where to start.
cherrychapsticc	made my day | 
cherrychapsticc	You should be open about this with him. Tell him how him doing this *makes you feel*. If he decides to disregard your feelings even still, then he's not worth it. Don't make the common mistake of investing your goodness into someone who doesn't give that back. Be assertive about this, don't be passive. Don't make it seem like it's something you don't want to bother him about, or doesn't matter, a mistake I've made many many times. 
cherrychapsticc	Seconding this. One person being mentally ill in a relationship is stressful enough, let alone both people being mentally ill. Take time for yourself to truly focus on yourself and love yourself, before getting into another relationship. It'll be worth it, trust me. 
cherrychapsticc	[Serious] What are the best ways to truly better yourself? | 
cherrychapsticc	If you're not happy with your job, then (and easier said than done I know) make an effort to try and get a different one. Don't waste your precious time in a job you dislike if you don't have to. Of course, if for some reason it really really is absolutely impossible to leave your job/career, try to make it as enjoyable as possible. That co-worker? Who cares what she thinks, if she wants to be rude like that, let her. Her life must be pretty shit if she's willing to openly be rude like that. Let her make a fool of herself.
cherrychapsticc	Exercising can actually be really fun. Especially if you get a bluetooth headset and listen to your favourite music. I do this at the gym and it just makes me feel totally bad ass, listening to heavy rock as I work out. Time flies especially if you keep your mind occupied and concentrate on the music. It's a small price to pay for looking fit and healthy.
cherrychapsticc	It's so fucking hard not to try and force my friend out of his abusive relationship, but there's just nothing I can do but be supportive...
cherrychapsticc	What are some of the wisest sayings and quotes? | 
cherrychapsticc	My Arabic middle name, given to me by my parents who knew full well I'd be growing up in the western world.
cherrychapsticc	Breastfeeding in public.
cherrychapsticc	English but I have conversations in french in my head sometimes.
cherrychapsticc	Easier said than done if you have ADHD
cherrychapsticc	tiny video that just helped me get over my anxiety attack | 
cherrychapsticc	The beer law is because when your brain is still developing, alcohol is very damaging to it. The younger you are the worse it is. Which is why it's best to wait until you're at least 21, but even then I think your brain stops fully developing at age 27. 
cherrychapsticc	What do I do if I don't know what to do in life? | I get I'm only 16 so maybe I'm just young, but I'm constantly stressing about what I want to do. My ADHD heavily influences this. I want to have something I'm extremely enthusiastic about and that I can just go all out on, but I just don't know what. I have a few interests such as drawing, piano, horse riding, and I enjoy these but I don't really want them as a career and I'm just mediocre at a lot of things, I can never find the enthusiasm to continue a lot of things. So many unfinished projects. I know I can do whatever I want in life and I'm ready to pursue whatever that is with passion but... I just don't know what I actually want to do. And I've been wondering if this would have something to do with my ADHD. Thoughts?
cherrychapsticc	That makes sense, I stress about it far more than I'd like. Thank you!
cherrychapsticc	"Take initiative!!" my mom yells at me because I'm supposed to be doing more chores around the house.   I don't know why, but those words echo in my head anytime I see something needing to be done. It's pushed me to do a lot of things.
cherrychapsticc	Not being taken seriously when I'm angry or upset. If I get angry in front of my friends or a boyfriend, it's like I'm just seen as an emotional mess. If I get upset, it's the same thing. And my reasons for getting angry or upset are usually very justified! But I feel I can't express myself naturally, I have to grind my teeth and try to stay calm otherwise I won't be taken as seriously. 
cherrychapsticc	Starbucks coffee
cherrychapsticc	My friends think I'm dumb because of my ADHD | This is a rant more than anything but..  I'm so impulsive and I always say things without thinking, like jokes that seem funny in my head and I say them before realising that it just sounds silly. I find it hard to socialise normally with multiple people because there are so many distractions and I'm so bad at just speaking in general, in my head o have pretend conversations all the time but when it comes to speaking I just get tongue tied and don't know how to just explain things smoothly. It's so hard to concentrate on what I'm saying and what I'm about to say next and what my friends are saying, all while getting distracted and zoning out.   So on the outside I just look like someone who's just dumb and silly and my friends rarely take me seriously... they joke about my stupidity, and I know they don't mean any harm, they're just joking around and I laugh along with it, but it hurts so much because there's nothing I can do about my behaviour. I try my best to just be normal but I always slip up and make a fool of myself.   I'm on a waiting list to get medication (I've already been diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago) but I could be waiting for up to a year, because my country(Ireland) is a train wreck when it comes to mental health and disabilities.   And even then, my mom who also has ADHD, said her meds gave her awful side effects like anxiety, and she's tried a few different types.   I feel stuck and I'll never be able to express myself the way I am in my head. Does anyone else feel this way?
cherrychapsticc	Verbal communication. Explaining things can be very difficult depending how hard I have to concentrate and how many distractions there are.  I'll also impulsively say a whole lot of things without thinking, I've built a reputation for being dumb around my friends because I make a fool of myself so often.  Thanks ADHD
cherrychapsticc	Aw nice hey there. And yeah, it's really annoying and right now private isn't an option for me, or a lot of people for that matter. I wish you luck though!
cherrychapsticc	I drink a lot of coffee actually, but I find it doesn't help that much.  I will try to speak less though. Easier said than done unfortunately..  Thank you for your advice! 
cherrychapsticc	In THEORY that would be great but 
cherrychapsticc	It's all about making money, no matter the sacrifice. 
JD-Explosion	What's something funny that your child or pet does, that would be less funny if your coworkers did the same? | 
JD-Explosion	That when I died, my flesh would used to feed the hungry. I am glad to see that my death was not in vain.
JD-Explosion	Because there'd be a ton of backlash if Katy Perry sang a song about "Little Illegal Mexican Girls."
JD-Explosion	Well, what do you expect from the guy who killed off Ariel?
JD-Explosion	I can vouch for this.
JD-Explosion	Find humor in things, even things that make no bloody sense. ESPECIALLY things that make no bloody sense.
JD-Explosion	"We're out of milk, you'll have to put the cereal back."
JD-Explosion	How about everybody just gets a standard test every five years or so?
JD-Explosion	Freddy VS Jason.
JD-Explosion	I always thought it was "No, Luke, I am your father." Weird.
JD-Explosion	Meet and Greet characters at Disneyland, especially if they were from different movies.
JD-Explosion	The Road to El Dorado. I wanna see more of my favorite implied-to-be-polyamorous trio and their adventures.
JD-Explosion	I would, but Tamatoa already did a pretty good job of that.
JD-Explosion	Maybe you should lay off it for a while. It's turning you green.
JD-Explosion	Your hair looks like it's trying to escape. I don't blame it.
JD-Explosion	You really need that much mascara? You look like you could fly if you blinked fast enough.
JD-Explosion	What's with the kissy mouth? You look like fish trying to whistle.
JD-Explosion	Go ahead, I dare you. | 
JD-Explosion	Damn it, Sans.
JD-Explosion	You should've listened to your mom when she said your face would freeze like that.
JD-Explosion	Goodbyyyyyyye nurse!
JD-Explosion	Please, I bet you love way more D's than just one.
JD-Explosion	Sid and Hannah from Toy Story, all grown up.
JD-Explosion	So THAT'S where my grandma's curtains went. By the way, you've got a little chocolate milk on your upper lip there.
JD-Explosion	She looks like the janitor from Futurama.
JD-Explosion	You look like you auditioned for a background role in the Twilight movies and never got a call back.
JD-Explosion	Congrats on getting that tumor out of your gut, but maybe they should've thrown it out instead of sticking it under your hair. You look like Frankenstein's son who he never sees.
JD-Explosion	He's so crusty I'm surprised he hasn't opened a restaurant in Bikini Bottom by now.
JD-Explosion	Nah, Sid's way better looking than you. And get that dead guinea pig off your head.
JD-Explosion	Is that your hair or did you put some gold-colored wrapping paper on your head?
JD-Explosion	I'm scared your moles are gonna come to life and yell at me about resetting my game.
JD-Explosion	Nice ears.
JD-Explosion	After all this time, it turns out Goldilocks IS a bear.
JD-Explosion	Hey Norman, how's your mom doing?
JD-Explosion	I didn't even notice your hair 'cause of that loud-ass shirt. Mixed emotions? More like mixed-up life choices.
JD-Explosion	Might wanna work on your penmanship there, little man. It looks like you sneezed while having a seizure during an earthquake trying to write that.
JD-Explosion	Nice hair. You look like a unicorn who gave up.
JD-Explosion	Hey look, you made all your dignity disappear.
JD-Explosion	You're calling us losers? You're the one wearing a piece of college rule paper as a hat. Maybe you should've worn it as a mask instead.
JD-Explosion	911 operators of Reddit, what's the weirdest call you've ever gotten? | 
JD-Explosion	More like Johnson & Johnson's Syndrome.
JD-Explosion	Fuck you, fuck your Jenga.
JD-Explosion	*approaches ottoman* Oh crap, how do I get it up there? I didn't think this through...
JD-Explosion	What are some things that I SHOULDN'T feed my crickets? | I've never owned crickets before and I want to make sure I'm not doing them more harm than good. And no, they're not being fed to any other animals; I'm keeping them for good luck. So is it safe for them to eat stuff containing refined sugar or anything?
JD-Explosion	That doesn't sound so bad. Rainbow Dash is cool!
JD-Explosion	I usually just open the dishwasher and let the dishes air dry before putting them away.
JD-Explosion	So the store itself isn't convenient, it just sells convenience?
JD-Explosion	The cheese strings are the best part, though.
JD-Explosion	That's actually kind of adorable. Tell Aunt Antonella I said hi.
JD-Explosion	You're half right. Both men and women have butts.
JD-Explosion	We use the same body parts for making love as we do for getting rid of bodily waste.
JD-Explosion	Are you telling me that shaving your pubes at work is not socially acceptable anymore?
JD-Explosion	1. A GIANT teddy bear 2. A multi-level glass hamster cage for my crickets 3. Maybe a smartphone.
JD-Explosion	Why would they fight eachother? They're the good guys.
JD-Explosion	"That's a nice stereo you've got there..."
JD-Explosion	Dang, I've been using my hair as floss this whole time.
JD-Explosion	I'd be a freelance metal sculptor.
JD-Explosion	Roses are red, violets are blue, Mom's going to a party and I'm going too.
JD-Explosion	When you say "I'm gay..." | Do you mean you're exclusively attracted to people the same SEX as you, or the same GENDER as you? Can it be one or the other, or does it have to be both?  EDIT: I'm asking about you, specifically. How do YOU define the word in regards to yourself?
JD-Explosion	Well, right now I'm speaking to you.
JD-Explosion	Okay, but what about you?
JD-Explosion	I've never heard of it until now. Thanks, I'll look it up.
JD-Explosion	Either Earthworm Jim or The Neverhood. Or possibly both in a crossover. They were both made by Doug TenNapel, so it could work. I feel like there's a lot of potential there.
JD-Explosion	Taste in food; that way, you won't have to share.
JD-Explosion	Oh, good! I hope they're true. Of course, this IS Marvel. Nobody ever stays dead for longer than they need to. Loki, Coulson, Groot, Loki again...
JD-Explosion	Okay, how do I do that?
JD-Explosion	Can anyone recommend a good fanfic where Tadashi... | ...survives? I need something to fix my broken heart, and I'm sure Tadashi himself would appreciate it too.
JD-Explosion	Any horror stories about bad caretakers you've had in the past? | 
JD-Explosion	Candyland. If you don't have it, you two can make your own gameboard out of a some cardboard and crayons/markers/paint/whatever, and draw different colored blobs on a deck of index cards. You can even use little toys as character pieces! And if it gets boring, start making up your own rules!
JD-Explosion	A cicada! A real one! | 
JD-Explosion	What's the best revenge you've ever gotten against a bad server or customer service rep? | 
JD-Explosion	No, you misunderstood the question. The idea is that the OTHER person is the server, not you.
JD-Explosion	Scanner/printer refuses to scan | I just turned it on after a year, and it keeps saying it needs new ink cartridges. I'm not even using any ink. I just want to scan a picture into my computer. I checked my printing queue, and there's nothing waiting there. Any idea what the problem could be?
JD-Explosion	Epson XP-410.
JD-Explosion	How come? Too busy with life in general?
JD-Explosion	The formatting of the website is what makes it difficult to navigate. As for Juicyads... My blog is SFW, thanks.
JD-Explosion	Natural redheads, which is a shame because they're truly beautiful.
JD-Explosion	In 2015, Aunt Rita will get a serious bronchial infection. Make sure she gets to the hospital on time.
JD-Explosion	Orphan. I kept expecting Esther to be a vampire or a demon or something, but it turns out she's just a sexually frustrated midget. Laaaaaaaaaaame.
JD-Explosion	My dog. She died from cancer when I was a teenager. She was a good girl.
JD-Explosion	My cat plays with cotton swabs. She seriously loves them.
JD-Explosion	My first grey hair. Thank God for hair dye, am I right?
JD-Explosion	Peeing a little bit every time I sneeze.
JD-Explosion	Keturah and Lord Death.
JD-Explosion	My own bibliography.
JD-Explosion	Sorry none of those will work for me. My blog is SFW and I won't have popups; inconveniences like that will deter people away from my blog, which is counterproductive.
JD-Explosion	If you don't think, you shouldn't talk.
JD-Explosion	I already did that and found nothing. Why do you think I'm here?
JD-Explosion	I know how to do it, I just need the name of a website.
JD-Explosion	Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls. He started out pretty cool and funny, but over the course of the second season he kinda fell apart.
JD-Explosion	Ever since I bought my first vibrator, the sound of buzzing turns me on. Even bees.
JD-Explosion	Sometimes I forget that everyone's face is different. It gets confusing when I hear people complain about "same-face syndrome" in cartoons and such, or when people talk about celebrities who look alike and I'm thinking "What are you talking about? They have different hair."
JD-Explosion	Any fictionkin Youtubers out there? | I'm curious to see how many Youtube channels there are run by fictionkin individuals, partially 'cause I'm thinking of starting my own once I get my Madotsuki outfit put together.
JD-Explosion	Any kind of fruit or vegetable. The possibilities are endless, man.
JD-Explosion	I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.
JD-Explosion	What do "normal" people do (or not do) that you find incredibly strange? | 
JD-Explosion	In his defense, how on Earth does THAT spell THAT?
JD-Explosion	People who turn on the shower before getting into it are wimps.
JD-Explosion	I don't know; I was asleep.
JD-Explosion	Avocado, full stop. If you wanna eat healthy, there's way tastier and cheaper things on the market.

Ryyi23	#1 Life Hack | 
Ryyi23	It hungers for souls | 
Jeggasyn	Cut the first half of the title of your favourite film. How does the story differ? | 
Jeggasyn	Also, shit on all door handles; because you know you're clean, nobody will get ill.
Jeggasyn	Tbl 999: got to be the biggest restaurant ever?
Jeggasyn	Good luck everyone. Sadly, I feel that the more this shit happens, the more that luck comes into play.
Jeggasyn	I also well up and get all teary when I'm explaining something that is substantial in a conversation. I may have a heightened emotional response to most things, but it is really annoying and embarrassing sometimes
Jeggasyn	Break-neck being the key phrase
Jeggasyn	r/creepy
Jeggasyn	Papa's Tagliatelle | [removed]
Jeggasyn	Trance music. I'm quite literally obsessed with the stuff produced pre-1998/97, and it was just mind-blowing
Jeggasyn	This is my life goal right here. I love lightning and I love getting as close as possible. I'm sure I'd shit myself if this happened though.
Jeggasyn	Surely this company will not last very long | 
Jeggasyn	Reminds me of this https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/uk/fake-mold-anti-theft-lunch-bag/
Jeggasyn	X-ray guided cortisone needle into my hip joint. The most uncomfortable feeling ever.
Jeggasyn	99.99999% of the time, a W is actually a double V. So why isn't it a double vee?!
Jeggasyn	You've been misinformed - earth has stronger gravity, that's why everything goes round it. 
Jeggasyn	Another bad joke and I'll have to nokia lights out
Jeggasyn	Raptor? Looks like an owl to me. 
Jeggasyn	Or stack it with toilet roll, eventually draining the battery
Jeggasyn	In contrast, you can cover the food in sunflower oil beforehand. This reduces saturation, because sunflower oil is very good for you.
Jeggasyn	ELI5: If we have only discovered only 14% of all living organisms on earth, which ones haven't we found? | 
Jeggasyn	vs. Stupid Girl
Jeggasyn	Remindme! One Week
Jeggasyn	For me it would be "days per text"
Jeggasyn	Wtf. How? 
Jeggasyn	Life | [removed]
Jeggasyn	But requesting someone to lay out what is probably their most destroying, traumatising experience to a bunch of strangers in the internet and then having to deal with the forthcoming bullshit comments could easily make it a life ending experience.
Jeggasyn	Probably not a great idea to get a rape victim to commit to posting their experience on social media. Search for this information elsewhere please.
Jeggasyn	There are many asteroids, varying in size, very close to earth that have yet to be discovered.
Jeggasyn	Wow, did not expect this comment. I'll go easy next time.
Jeggasyn	Not me, but by mum.     My mum was understandably quite strict in bringing up two boys all by herself. One day all three of us are sitting at the dinner table and my bro starts talking. Before he'd finished his sentence, my mum shoots him down "Don't eat with your mouth full!"     We all sit there for a few seconds and then proceed to cry with uncontrollable laughter.
Jeggasyn	Just make sure you cover the lenses in sunscreen and drink lots of water.
Jeggasyn	You've clearly misinterpreted the research. 20 smokers quit per cent. So if you raise it to $5 then only 100 smokers will quit.
Jeggasyn	"Hey! Hey Souperman! Remember what you are. You are Souperman. Don't forget what you are here to do. Don't be sidetracked; channel your rage and strength to what it is that you desire."    Superman stared infinitely at the man. Slowly, he realised exactly what his purpose is. Gradually increasing the power of his laser sight, his left arm twisted behind his back and under his cape. Revealing a can of Campbell's Chicken and Mushroom, he guided the searing laser around the lid.
Jeggasyn	Totally agree; especially if those noises are coming from the passenger seat
Jeggasyn	If the NHS is to survive it's got to start doing things differently | 
Jeggasyn	Wow, that's impressive! Who shot your knees?
Jeggasyn	I've no problem with spending £4 on a pint of lager, but would never pay the same for 20 herbal tea bags. | 
Jeggasyn	You just jogged my memory - what happened to castlemain XXXX?
Jeggasyn	Get a doctorate in med school so you can doctor your own doctor notes to take time off being a doctor.
Jeggasyn	What's his/her name?
Jeggasyn	Channel 4 - The Great Global Warming Swindle
Jeggasyn	On the iceberg that the Titanic hit. The spotters in the crows nest would be like "Sir! Sir! Ice-rex right ahead!"
Jeggasyn	When I was around 10years old, my brother  and I used to fall asleep watching TV, on the carpet in front of our gas fire. Turns out some stupid builders had cemented up the chimney and we were being slowly killed by carbon monoxide poisoning.   And when I was 12 I was hospitalised in Spain from food poisoning by eating mussels. The doctor said I was very lucky to be alive. 16years on, and I just love seafood.
Jeggasyn	Hahaha. Best comment ever. I wish I had some gold. Or a spare family guy box set to send to those poor kids.
Jeggasyn	That is just hideous. I love the way they have colour coordinated the wheel covers.
Jeggasyn	I, like many people, don't understand how much training and practice goes into becoming a professional golf player. The players understand exactly how to control the ball and the club.
Jeggasyn	What about South Park?
Jeggasyn	Waves that carry information. WiFi/satellite/phones/transmissions etc.
Jeggasyn	Hard hitting, and just awesome.
Jeggasyn	This title cracked me up :)
Jeggasyn	Bon Iver - Holocene https://youtu.be/-oCPAO3bp4Q 
Jeggasyn	Does that make them fruitables?
Jeggasyn	This entire mix https://youtu.be/UEUbJo3cvKE
Jeggasyn	Reminds me of https://youtu.be/nm1K68PuYBY 
Jeggasyn	Did he fuck the pedal bin up during his frenzy?
Jeggasyn	Well, here in the UK, they normally close the forecourt when aforementioned procedure is undertaken. I guess we can because there's normally another station within several miles.
Jeggasyn	Almost impossible, surely.
Jeggasyn	Cheaper soy sauce is just soy sauce mixed with water, and therefore more expensive. | 
Jeggasyn	Hmmm. I just don't get how you took the photo of an open car without the owner nearby. OP owns the car?
Jeggasyn	Bärk bãrk
Jeggasyn	Nope. Just 'regular' soy sauce. The 'light' and 'dark' of the cheaper one are the same price as the regular. The bit in the brackets is the ingredients of proper soy sauce.
Jeggasyn	The guy drives around by himself mumbling this posts' title.
Jeggasyn	You must remember that rain is cold, so the trees contribute to global cooling 
Jeggasyn	Although a shitty life pro tip, I have done this.
Jeggasyn	I'd spend it on giving out Reddit gold! r/fishingforkarma 
Jeggasyn	I'm quite a calm person, not much bothers me. But I recently had this guy in front of me all over the road. When I eventually passed him, I took a glance and he was drinking a can of red bull, with headphones on, smoking, and on his phone. I fucking flipped. If you're finding it hard to fathom, the can and cigarette and steering wheel was in one hand, the phone in the other.
Jeggasyn	If you think about it, crabs must be the ninjas of the sea bed; how the hell can they catch a shrimp? 
Jeggasyn	LPT: instead of washing the dishes when you have just cooked a meal (which no-one likes doing), just put it all away straight away. This saves time washing stuff that you may not use for weeks. | 
Jeggasyn	Did you sniff coke up one nostril?   r/shittyaskscience
Jeggasyn	Ha! Try typing that into the insurance company website.
Jeggasyn	An Asian dessert that is good (and not ice cream based)

Jeggasyn	A good way to get the mother in law out of the way..
Jeggasyn	Walter White
Jeggasyn	The storyline to your favourite film/TV series now revolves around cheese rolls. How does it differ? | 
Jeggasyn	Now, I'd really like to see a ladybug covered in mountain dew
Jeggasyn	The fact that, literally hundreds of thousands of millions of people have died to give us the privilege and comfort of modern society. If anyone can't appreciate that, then fuck off.
Jeggasyn	Death. And before anyone argues, it is irrational, because it is inevitable.
Jeggasyn	I don't think that football (soccer) fans actually understand where this money is coming from.
Jeggasyn	I preferred Ski Free. Put the yeti on the minefield, he'll sort this shit out.
Jeggasyn	It's Hover! from Windows 95
Jeggasyn	That face says "I've seen some shit, and I'm happy".    All the best, spend every minute with her.
Jeggasyn	Clearly trying to copy this http://imgur.com/stspygt
Jeggasyn	Ah, the good old days.. | 
Jeggasyn	"Yarr got t be kiddin me!"
Jeggasyn	If you can afford it, yes. But probably best to wait. Make sure you have a decent rig to enjoy it to its fullest. I personally think that governments should fund the developers to make it free, because it is science at its best.
Jeggasyn	Well, that one is truly obscure! Looks like an Egyptian Mechwarrior prototype
Jeggasyn	Looks like he's having fun on a water slide
Jeggasyn	Well, you got me there. Life's a beach.
Jeggasyn	The amount of small encounters in which I'd changed someone else's life dramatically
Jeggasyn	If McDonald's and Coca Cola are soo bad for you, why is everyone in the adverts happy? | 
Jeggasyn	Wow, look how flat it is. And they even pronounced the Egyptian pyramids - THAT is how flat our world is
Jeggasyn	How much post process was used? It looks quite natural compared to most r/EarthPorn photos
Jeggasyn	Can't wait to get the next intruder..
Jeggasyn	What, you mean the image? Maybe it's on a CD which is lodged behind a rock behind a waterfall or something.
Jeggasyn	It's the stare that made me chuckle
Jeggasyn	Made out of ginger.    Made in China.
Jeggasyn	But it is tho innit?
Jeggasyn	So, a 'phone'?

lyla50	I was too many years ago...
lyla50	Mac and cheese, because is there anything better?
lyla50	When cleaning the scene dont be too clean, if in a home make sure it looks like it was lived in, not a magazine shoot. Also destroy teeth and facial structure burn off finger prints so if found it is hard to ID.  When disposing of body cutting it up and burying it will save time and wont be obvious to neighbours if you decide to bury in your backyard. A tip: If you bury the body 6-10 feet under a dead animal it is likely that body-sniffing hounds will dig up the dead animal and the police will think its a false positive.   I swear I didnt kill anyone
lyla50	Grilled salmon, rice, corn and salad

lyla50	I want credit if it makes it on the big screen. 
lyla50	I owe this to being a forensics major. Not a serial killer. 
lyla50	My dreams were just crushed. Also I'm a she, that knows very little about cars apparently, disappointed in myself a little. 
lyla50	Thats not an option due to job, school, location i live in and overall weather in Canada. 
lyla50	Timing, not having an international league like soccer and other sports
lyla50	Whats a good SUV/Crossover for fuel economy and commuting via highway? | 
lyla50	I'm looking at buying a jeep wrangler, the ad states the engine was rebuilt professionally. It's a great price want to know if its worth calling to get a look at it. They claim everything else is great there was work done recently (new suspension, tires)
lyla50	Is buying a car with a rebuilt engine good or bad? Whats the difference? | [removed]

lyla50	"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth."

lyla50	More than I should. I tend to rotate alot, I get rid of alot of clothes (donate) and then fill the empty spaced I created with new clothes. This past month I spent 700$ on new clothes and shoes. 
lyla50	Split my head open that was pretty bad
lyla50	Mostly they go to crash and burn 
lyla50	People with a long commute to school or work, how do you get through the long drive or bus/train ride? | 
lyla50	I got kicked out of my program, hit my car, had a panic attack in public all in the same day. So that day  would be a whole day of bad luck.

lyla50	Custom colour palettes are great, colourpop is cheaper and they are great shadows you can customize a palette from matte to shimmer to glitters. maybe good for future reference. I love MAC but it really is expensive. 
lyla50	Checked these out seem very interesting definetly will listen on the road Thank you. 
lyla50	I would, but I drive so unless they have an audio book for my textbooks that wont happen.

lyla50	how many water bottles do you have laying around your room (disposable or re-useable)? |

lyla50	Scrubs and Gilmore Girls
lyla50	They wont make it up here too cold for them 
lyla50	Rugrats:  The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica’s imagination. Chuckie died a long time ago along with this mother; that’s why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time. Tommy was a stillborn; that’s why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live. The DeVilles had an abortion. Angelica couldn’t figure whether it would be a boy or a girl, thus creating the twins.

lyla50	Bought a car I didnt really need, my old one was fine. 
lyla50	Semi-prepared for a flood not much for anything

lyla50	how much am I paid? and would this be recorded or something? because if not I'd just swim to a boat and sail the rest. 
atomicalexx	I see what you mean. Some girl posted a comment on /r/AskMen about how some guy at the gym approached her to compliment her. She said that at first she thought he was a creep but after taking a good look at him she was totally okay with it because she found him "kinda cute". You should have seen the amount of downvotes and negative replies she received. She was basically saying that if a guy isn't attractive but still flirts with a girl, it automatically makes him a "creep". It's mean but yet it is many people's first thought in that scenario. 
atomicalexx	What's classy if you're physically attractive but trashy if you're not? | 
atomicalexx	This is what happens when you floop the pig

atomicalexx	"You're very beautiful for a black girl!" I could tell they were genuinely trying to compliment me, but telling someone that they are [insert positive trait here] for their race/sex/anything is implying that it's abnormal in the first place. The person that told me this obviously believed that a black woman being beautiful was a rarity which is definitely not true.
atomicalexx	What is the most important piece of advice your mother has ever given you? | 
atomicalexx	Yoon Jisung Chosen As Wanna One Leader After Group Vote | 
atomicalexx	Holy! Hwall is beautiful! How can someone look like that! That shouldn't be allowed! 
atomicalexx	Get yourself a man that can do both ;)
atomicalexx	Wanna One's popularity over the next year is going to be scary almost. I can't wait to see what the future holds for them!
atomicalexx	I know, this page is so visually appealing :D
atomicalexx	When you actually consider the fact that this guy once had the most subscribers on YouTube....
atomicalexx	Yeah, I'll leave this to my white friends...
atomicalexx	For once knetz made the right choice! 
atomicalexx	Yes, I was actual quite a popular kid growing up that made friends quite easily (but because of a lack of investment in those relationships, lost them just as easily, but that's not my point here).  But of course, I would come across bullies that to this day I believe were probably jealous of my befriending skills. How did I deal with them? I would be ten times as mean to them as they were to me :-)  From a young age I knew no one liked the taste of their own medicine (and much less an overdose of it).
atomicalexx	Honestly the most accurate imitation of Seongwoo's part that I've heard at 0:24. Lol during the Never stage I felt so attacked at that part!  Plus Gunhee's perfect Daehwi fashionista reference at 2:31
atomicalexx	What about NCT U???
atomicalexx	That only female mosquitoes suck blood.
atomicalexx	I think Jungkook would be like Park Woojin. Woojin was pretty quiet and kinda overshadowed by his label mate Daehwi during the first few episodes. But after he proved hinself with his great dancing skills in Get Ugly and later his great rapping skills in Never he started to become a lot more open.  For Jungkook he would just need to prove himself and gain confidence to get more screentime and win over the national producers, just like Woojin did
atomicalexx	Oh my gosh! I'm so excited.  I'm totally digging Woojin showing his true self (even though it resulted in him getting a piece of Jihoon's mind lol!)  Minhyun with Jinyoung though! Even though we could only see the back of their heads for the majority of the video I still can't handle that visual overload! 
atomicalexx	...my brain hurts...
atomicalexx	A bit like Park Woojin right? 
atomicalexx	Began at 16 and I'm 19 now. I started with the acoustic guitar back when I was 13. But after actually starting to *listen* to music at around 15, I just couldn't help not focusing on that silent but oh, so present muddy sound that was usually there in the background. I took up the bass a year later and can't wait to see how far I'll go with it!
atomicalexx	Oh my god! Justice for Kim Samuel!
slomotion	Awful taste but great execution but also tastes good  /r/ATBGEBATG
slomotion	basically all of /r/thalasophobia 
slomotion	I also hear 'sidewalk sale' pretty often I wonder if that's mostly in cities.
slomotion	Ooh yea like that magic shell stuff
slomotion	That paint job is incredible. I don't think I've seen that color on a car before - like a glossy olive drab. It works perfectly
slomotion	I just moved here from the city and one thing I've noticed was how many badass jeeps there are out here. You don't see many worked up jeeps in the city I feel like.
slomotion	[TFW pornographers have stronger moral values than church pastors](http://www.catholiclane.com/wp-content/uploads/joel-osteen.jpg)
slomotion	It's like a <5min ride to the terminal. They try to deboard the plane as quickly as possible so they just cram you in there.
slomotion	Looks like it's in pretty good condition considering the location
slomotion	What does that mean
slomotion	My gf is the one who makes them. She is vegan and I am not and I think this is my favorite thing that she makes. Here's the recipe:  * 1 head cauliflower, chopped in bite size pieces.  * 1/2 cup water  * 1/2 cup flour  * 1 tsp garlic powder  * 1/2 tsp salt shaking of red pepper flakes  * 1 tbsp or so butter (I used vegan butter, but doesn't matter)  * 1/4-1/2 cup hot sauce (tapatio is my fave)   mix flour, garlic powder, salt, water and red pepper flakes. mix with cauliflower, put on baking sheet at 450 for 15 minutes, flipping halfway remove from oven, mix butter and hot sauce, and toss the cauliflower in that mixture cook for 25-30 minutes at 450 (longer if they still look 'wet', the burned pieces are delicious imo)
slomotion	I don't think that would alleviate the problem. Maybe if you used a stiff bread, but I don't think those go well with burgers.
slomotion	That's a lot of threads
slomotion	I kind of had the inverse problem  "I'm from San Francisco"  "Oh cool, whereabouts?"  "Like in the city, I lived in the avenues"  "???"
slomotion	But then it'll get floppy and fall apart I think. You'd just be trading one impracticality for another.
slomotion	You should test this theory and report back
slomotion	Cauliflower wings are the bee's knees
slomotion	I guess she can kiss her hopes for an NBA championship goodbye
slomotion	Wow this is brilliant. Are you an engineer or something?
slomotion	>  Burn down a few buildings and leave them smoldering?  That seems to be the strategy so far. Several housing developments have been torched repeatedly past couple of months.
slomotion	No, you need a ton of examples for it to be able to recognize a face accurately
slomotion	Um are you confusing that bmw with an audi?
slomotion	I love how spaz #2 comes bowling into the camera just barely out-of-frame
slomotion	I highly doubt that they've categorized trillions of images on the internet for a classifier.
slomotion	Yea that's all nonsense. There is no such thing as a 'nuculus'  Since English is a living language and all, why don't we give it it's own definition.  "Nucular:" a term used by people ignorant of science to refer to nuclear science and policies
slomotion	Haha this is pretty great  > if the lhc actually destroys the earth & this page isn't yet updated please email [redacted] to receive a full refund
slomotion	People do this at outside lands every year
slomotion	Dude I was totally rejecting the prescriptivist tendencies of 19th century grammarians imposing arbitrary rules on the language. Did you not see that? I was imposing my own rules on the language since anything is permissible.  In fact, I've decided 'nucular' is incorrect and now the correct spelling is 'nuoo-q-lurr' and everyone who disagrees is a 19th century grammarian.
slomotion	Some of the most obnoxious bullshit I've ever read.   TLDR monitor your credit.
slomotion	Works fine for me, you're probably doing something wrong
slomotion	What is DPi?
slomotion	Lol I'll be sure to ask for the guy with the leather gloves next time I visit
slomotion	Nah dude that thing goes for sure
slomotion	Yup I'm pretty sure it's the same guy who tears around McCovey cove during Giants games
slomotion	And flying nearly anywhere in the world is cheaper and more accessible to more people than it ever has before. A bit of stress is a small price to pay for this small miracle.   But I suppose it's more fun to bitch and complain from your insulated bubble.
slomotion	Why does Drake need a 5 car convoy anyway? It's not like they've got all the touring equipment in there
slomotion	The public does know. It's was all over the news when it happened. The video footage was simply not released. Add to that fact, pretty much all of the suspects were juveniles, so their identities are supposed to be protected.   To be clear, fuck all of those kids, they should all be locked up. However I can understand BART's stance for deciding not to release the footage. It would have done nothing to promote justice for the incident and would have just fanned the racial tension that exists right now in Oakland.
slomotion	The vast majority of liberals aren't anti-vax either
slomotion	What the fuck is your point anyway? Or are we just playing whack-a-strawman?
slomotion	Because doing so doesn't benefit the authorities investigation in any way and it just give people like you more ammo to post about the 'dindunuffins'  There's no upside
slomotion	uh.. not exactly - air pressure on land isn't always necessarily lower than on the ocean, it changes everywhere.   The center of a hurricane will always be a low pressure area.  You should know that this video is providing an incorrect explanation for storm surges. Air pressure has little effect on water level, when you're talking about bodies of water as large as the ocean.
slomotion	Nearly all weather is due to pressure gradients. Wind is caused by air moving from a high pressure area to a lower pressure area. If the gradient is larger, you have stronger wind. 
slomotion	Is there anything those damn rednecks WON'T chop and drop!?
slomotion	I mean, that's all that matters right? Who cares about accuracy as long as it's convincing
slomotion	They're not releasing it to the news media you idiot. It's not like they're dismissing the evidence
slomotion	That sounds weird but I'm willing to give it a try. Only condiment I'm used to putting on eggs is hot sauce
slomotion	This is the type of valuable insight I come to Reddit for
slomotion	> Inconel X-750  Sounds fancy! And expensive
slomotion	How does it work with these races. Do owners hire professional drivers to compete with their car? These races are just for shits n giggles right? Or is there like a professional racing body like an FIA equivalent?
slomotion	Next time I'm at Costco I'm writing up a comment card essay about /u/peacefulknightmare
slomotion	Oh my dog
slomotion	I dunno, I can fathom MarioKart pretty well
slomotion	You're reading comprehension is about as bad as your understanding of motorsports. It's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.
slomotion	My favorite book store! Their staff reviews are all on point. Pretty much every book I've gotten based on those reviews I've really enjoyed. So happy for them, congrats on 50 years!
slomotion	Nobody is going to try and doxx some small-potatoes videogamer. Nobody cares who you are dude I promise.
slomotion	> Like I said, you could not begin to fathom the level of involvement I have in racing.  Your level of involvement is *truly unfathomable*  [MFW I realize that guy was 'clearly not looking down the track'](https://media.giphy.com/media/EldfH1VJdbrwY/giphy.gif) 
slomotion	See the thing is that these drivers are much much MUCH better than you. So this kind of thing is pretty rare.
slomotion	I think I was around 5 when I started playing video games as well
slomotion	Watching the stream right now (replay)   ~~I think this exact race is going on this minute~~  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJIIaFG404
slomotion	Catslaps is my favorite subreddit
slomotion	Those Poles have got some twisted imaginations. I love it
slomotion	Congrats! You are the -2147483648^th person to make a polite Canadians joke on Reddit!  ^I ^am ^a ^bot.
slomotion	Madness
slomotion	Design principles for desktop don't always apply on mobile for certain applications. Even if you're fully responsive.
slomotion	Indiana Jones maybe?
slomotion	We're probably not going to be competitive but I'm excited to watch our newbies.  Also, Dodgers and Niners? You're an odd duck
slomotion	How is it people ask this same question every single time? If you're genuinely confused by a sandwich, I feel bad for you dude.
slomotion	Hah! Six pack in the six pack (kinda)
slomotion	So this subreddit is just robots now?  kind of like /r/shittycarmods is /r/anyandallcarmods now, /r/dataisbeautiful is /r/myexcelspreadsheet now, etc...
slomotion	Haha same. All too familiar feeling. The fact that the epicenter was all the way in South Mexico is just wild. Hope people are okay down there.
slomotion	His new course is in Python but I've found that the old one is a bit better at explaining the fundamentals. Ymmv of course
slomotion	What does that have to do with the db? All your CC data should be encrypted which means no actual numbers in the db
slomotion	So, [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XotiySdBICU&t=2m45s) basically?
slomotion	That would definitely be easier, I wonder how many false positives that would produce though.  You're right though, my way is probably overkill
slomotion	I've thought about it, filtering comments for keywords and maybe applying ML similar to the spam recognition pipeline. But then again I don't feel like scouring thousands of examples of that dumb Canadian joke for training data.
slomotion	Why are you a niners fan then
slomotion	Yea does anybody know his friend who he gets stuff from?
slomotion	I've really come to hate the sound of that v12 swap.   And in a corvette?? Fuck all that
slomotion	I went from being excited for him as a rook to souring on him because of his clashes with Rossi last year to really liking him again this year. The things he's been doing with that bike have constantly left my jaw on the floor this season. He really is a joy to watch when he actually wants to race.
slomotion	Looks great! How did it taste? I've been wanting to try this out for a while. You think this would work with ribs?
slomotion	Wrong
slomotion	Where from?
slomotion	It almost definitely took much longer than 18 hrs
slomotion	The pitting on the turret looks cool, did you do that? Or did the model come that way?  Treads and wheels could use some weathering I think, they still look a bit plastic-y.   Nice effort overall
slomotion	But then who cuts the chicken?
slomotion	Damn dude that is some heavy shading on a sensitive area. Totally worth it though, looks awesome
slomotion	I've really been liking Kaskade's new EP actually
slomotion	Been listening to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRf0PoLp18M) mostly. It's kinda got that generic summer house sound but I like it.
slomotion	Do they time it with the kick?
slomotion	That's exactly what a joke is you dunce
slomotion	I thought Big Dogs shirts were exclusively dad-wear clothing
slomotion	That is a trebuchet you muppet
slomotion	Right on red is legal everywhere in the US as far as I know. I've never seen otherwise
slomotion	...And? Lane splitting is legal in a lot of places
slomotion	ooooohhhh nice. Say something about 'hand-egg' now
slomotion	lol it's really not dangerous at all and is better for traffic
slomotion	Congrats you figured out the intent of the pic.  
slomotion	Lol maybe you're the idiot
slomotion	Same

GoingToHelvetica	Help with remembering a painting's title | There's a painting that I adore, but for the life of me can't remember the title or artist's name (terrible I know). It's somewhat abstract but shows a small figure standing in front of a body of water with lots of cloudy/overcast sky. It's very atmospheric. It's hauntingly beautiful and has a melancholy sort of feel to it as most of the hues in the painting are blue and grey. I want to say the title is something along the lines of "The Great Abyss" or "Into the Void" but when I google these nothing comes up. Any ideas?   This has been driving me crazy for weeks! Thanks!

GoingToHelvetica	There might be a few reasons why you're not getting responses. If you're emailing property management companies they're pretty busy, especially around this time of year when a bunch of students are moving into the area. I'd recommend calling them and/or showing up in person to discuss renting a property. Places like PPM have scheduled times to view properties on their website. Make sure you note that and show up when they're showing the property so you can see it, and so you can turn in your application.   Also, not to be rude, but it might be the way in which you're writing to these companies/individuals requesting more information about the property you're interested in. They're looking for good tenants, and if your email comes off as unprofessional they may not be interested in renting to you.   Hopefully this helps a little. Good luck.

GoingToHelvetica	HAE experienced a tingling tongue when having painful menstrual cramps? |  The tingling sensation is mostly in the tip of the tongue and feels similar to the bubbling sensation of drinking a carbonated beverage. Usually when I experience my tongue tingling I am having painful cramps. Taking ibuprofen usually subsides the cramps and the tingling tongue.  I am mostly curious if others experience this? It seems like an usual thing to get tingling in my tongue when I am feeling pain elsewhere in the body. It's not really alarming, but I am mostly just curious what this could possibly mean, if anything much at all other than it is just my body telling me I'm in pain elsewhere and to do something to fix it?  Any insights to this are welcome. Thank you!
GoingToHelvetica	That life is meaningless. You can put meaning to it, but you're still one tiny human made of matter in a vast universe you barely know anything about.

a__dead__man	I bet you have dicks for nipples
a__dead__man	I'll take "how do you know someone is an idiot" for 200
a__dead__man	They'll get around that by making your players worse
a__dead__man	I think earthquakes would be more violent than a twitch. Probably a muscle cramp/spasm. 
a__dead__man	Hurricanes are like bad farts because everyone evacuates the area 
a__dead__man	Crowd fund underage softcore porn?  You're a monster
a__dead__man	I was more surprised that they said it wasn't from drugs  Still don't believe it tbh unless it was the cumulative comedown killed her
a__dead__man	/r/fuxtaposition
a__dead__man	You'd think all the downvotes would get into someone's heads sometimes
a__dead__man	Honestly thought it was a transgender woman
a__dead__man	I mean if you try enough fancy flicks then you should have a lovely highlight video on YouTube by the end of the year and anyone who doesn't watch you regularly will think your unbelievable 
a__dead__man	He scored in 5 straight games when August was over last year and 3 or 4 the year before 
a__dead__man	5) have big tits  6) don't have small tits
a__dead__man	Touch of magic on her 
a__dead__man	The big advantage Apple has is that its 1000 for the base model so if you want an iPhone you have to pay it  You can cheap out with samsungs and get something half decent for half the price 
a__dead__man	No blur no party  Bring back song 2!!
a__dead__man	Indoor football 😍
a__dead__man	So do coders take baths in higher numbers than regular people? 
a__dead__man	This person will more than likely be given 2 options,  1. Pay an overloading fee usually to price of a second skip  2. Empty out the excess and have the company take away one load and bring back a second skip for the price of a second skip  Theyre not being clever, they're just making more work for themselves. No skip company in their right mind would let them get away with paying the price of one skip. 
a__dead__man	Maintenance is always easier
a__dead__man	And i like em even more than cocaine!!   Nom nom nom
a__dead__man	What about moose soup? 
a__dead__man	Well you should come over later for moose soup 
a__dead__man	They're gonna play him in goal  Probably only get about 5/6 playing there
a__dead__man	That's grim
a__dead__man	I had horses growing up so thats why i said that. Never had cows but horses have many other purposes asides from livestock so its no wonder they're typically seen as different 
a__dead__man	Tesco*
a__dead__man	My family owned horses when i was young so i see them as pets! If i never had that growing up then id probably want to try it.  Just like i never had cats growing up and id be closer to trying that before horse meat  Its just what I associate in my mind when i think of certain species of animals 
a__dead__man	I know it probably would be but we used to have horses as a child so itd be like eating dog
a__dead__man	No surprises there! I've eaten a whole wealth of weird different (delicious) things in France! I drew the line at horse meat! 
a__dead__man	When he gets high enough it won't matter much! Just needs to be in the right third of the pitch and he'll probably score! 
a__dead__man	To wham bam thank you captain man
a__dead__man	Fuck that guy
a__dead__man	How many square feet can i get in Gary, Indiana is the big question  
a__dead__man	Was really hoping for a purple spurs one! The current third is too close to the away jersey! 
a__dead__man	And for all we know he was sat in the car slow stroking and getting off to the power  If we're gonna be optimistic then we can be pessimistic too :) 
a__dead__man	You goddamn bitch! 
a__dead__man	Well maybe the bad press will make him get all his security together and tell them to stop being dickheads. They represent him at the end of the day 
a__dead__man	May as well give him a death sentence 
a__dead__man	Not anymore :'(
a__dead__man	Peggettino
a__dead__man	How do you feel right now? :) 
a__dead__man	Give him a new contract!!  
a__dead__man	He looks like good fun in the crazy lad sort of way! Probably why he got in trouble  Everybody knows one and they say stupid shit but you love them anyway 
a__dead__man	Gotta love seeing that big pudgy face in the thumbnail 
a__dead__man	The best way hands down to regain possession against the computer is to cut off the passing lanes and aim to tackle when the opponent is about to take his first touch. In all difficulties they never really let it run and it can also force a bad one touch pass. Always keep your shape by changing defenders immediately when they pass the ball. Don't chase 2 players with 1 because you'll leave holes that the AI are great at exploiting.
a__dead__man	Ya but i think uefa should step in then if there is an unfair advantage to these teams in the champions League but cash rules everything around them
a__dead__man	Germany will follow soon apparently 
a__dead__man	Because you don't know anything about estonia, niger and Uzbekistan 
a__dead__man	*obligatory jack wheelchair comment* 
a__dead__man	50 years ago ye were way behind on racism to a lot of countries   Many countries improved alot in this 50 years and America only improved a small bit so yere closer to the top than ever  
a__dead__man	And is buying advertisements even illegal? Especially when its not favouring a particular outcome 
a__dead__man	Woo patriarchy ftw
a__dead__man	I'll believe it when I see it
a__dead__man	eefa
a__dead__man	Back at you! You big sphincter! 
a__dead__man	It does annoy me that flairs get downvoted for replying to rival flairs.  Good jokes and legitimate points are dismissed alot of the time as just straight insults or trolling.  Change the flair and the perception of what the commenter meant changes 
a__dead__man	Im just really fat
a__dead__man	I used to work for Amazon in Ireland and their toilet breaks were crazy. Maximum of 10 minutes a day but also a max of 20 minutes per week. You had to change the status on your computer so everything was recorded and some managers would call you out on it and even go as far as threaten your job.   I had an understanding with my manager and told him if i need to take a shit then im going for it. Like any good manager he just told me that as long as i give him the numbers he wants then i could do what i want.    Edit: this has seriously blown up so i thought i had to add that i was treated with great respect while working there and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.   I cant speak for other employees in the business but i have heard the stories.   Incidentally i now work in construction where someone isn't looking over your shoulder and checking every minute of every day. If you haven't seen the great movie office space, watch it. Describes my situation perfectly    To answer your other question - my manager was looking for performance numbers. I was the one looking for 1's and 2's
a__dead__man	He had plenty of chances when kane was injured last season. I dont go along with the assumption that he didn't have the minutes. Anyone who watched him can see he wasn't good enough. Can't get through your career on your potential alone. We demand results. . . And dembele junior
a__dead__man	Whispering to players without their club's knowledge trying to get them to force a move. That sounds familiar doesn't it? 
a__dead__man	I find that offensive against my potato faced countrymen
a__dead__man	Most managers would be fine but some would probably look for a doctor's note
a__dead__man	You could take a max of 10mins in a single day and 20mins for the week
a__dead__man	Almost all large multinationals have something bases in Ireland for many reasons   English speaking   Central time zone to the rest of the world  Low corporate tax (illegally low for many)   Highly qualified labor force  In the EU and uses the euro
a__dead__man	No :P
a__dead__man	Here he comes again  https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=000_1503633764
a__dead__man	That was the rule! I took my 10 mins a day and and went to the bathroom straight after a call because you wouldn't get another call for another few minutes. My manager didn't really care because I was performing well so it was ok and didn't affect me too much. 
a__dead__man	All of them! 
a__dead__man	I can honestly say i took the time to admire all of it. Even how good that stonework looks 😍
a__dead__man	C'mon girdle! . . . Hold! 
a__dead__man	Alexander arnold
a__dead__man	Only if you extort her with threats of releasing the video evidence that also shows you extorting her! Makes sense right? 
a__dead__man	Give him a week or two of 90 mins before doing anything id say
a__dead__man	Oh well! I Captained kane again! Ive gotten 8 points total from my captain in all game weeks! Fuck my life 
a__dead__man	The 3 points are in the bag 
a__dead__man	Usually I would say the same but trump is so vain that it definitely bothers him. Not too many old men getting spray tans
a__dead__man	Both
a__dead__man	How's he look? 
a__dead__man	59!? Damn i wanna look like that at 59
a__dead__man	Who? 
a__dead__man	Until he puts your head in the toilet 
a__dead__man	I know! It'll be tough to call who'll come after us! :P
a__dead__man	Its not clickbait if the title is exactly what happens in the video
a__dead__man	*gets beat up*
a__dead__man	anyone who actually saw the difference in how that barca team played before and after pep and thinks he's overrated is crazy! Sure its a good team to takeover but he made them play the best football over any other team in history!   Why would pep get criticism for taking barca and bayern to different levels but zidane is praised for doing the same with madrid even though the team he inherited was in better shape than the barca team pep got! Its just an uninformed circle jerk! 
a__dead__man	Morning after 2 for 1 taco night
a__dead__man	Nobody can say he's lucky anymore just like pep! People think pochettino should never have gotten the so'ton job but look how that turned out.  Some managers just show man management and tactics so well that they can leap frog ahead. I think the man management is a huge factor for all three who stabilized a club after a tough period.  
a__dead__man	Beta career mode is finished career mode
a__dead__man	We'll give him 3 fifty a week 
a__dead__man	What are you trying to say?   Cmon now! Annunciate! 
a__dead__man	No. . . £3.50!
a__dead__man	I'm gonna jump right to the twist at the end. . . . They're the milkman's kids
a__dead__man	Something about being poor on his left side
a__dead__man	I hope you get the ride james! ;) 
a__dead__man	Sick nasty
a__dead__man	A sir. Royce with cheese 
a__dead__man	I would've said vidic but liverpool torres showed us its easy

rohitbangera	Glad to hear that! Thank you :)
rohitbangera	Hey mate!  Thank you for taking the time to listen to my mixes and your feedback. I am always open to feedback and appreciate your thoughts.   I am just trying to push (and enjoy) myself and showcase as many new releases in that particular week. I do agree prog house is more about taking folks on a journey rather than cramming more songs in the set. All the big DJ's use on an average of 10-15 tracks in their set. However, I am doing my own thing. This is me on a mix. You might like it or hate it, but it is my style.  I do enjoy making 10-15 track mixes. My initial mixes had few tracks and I was just learning to mix and wanted to make sure, the mix sounded like an hour long song with flawless transitions. I still do occasionally drop sets like that, when I come across new releases which deserve a bit more air time rather than a cut or fast transition to other side.  In regards to different genres mixed and tracks not in order, I have never given it a thought. I normally start of with deep/prog and finish it off with techno (I have a deep love for it :) ) I do agree when you sometimes put a melodic prog into a techno or deep into a tech, it sometimes throws the flow off. I will work hard on ensuring the transition among different genres is smooth and does not sound rushed.  Again, I do not follow any rules (mixing within the same genre, having a set number of tracks etc.). I just go with the flow and try to have as much fun as I can. I am not doing this to seek validation or get x number of plays. This is my passion and it gives me a reason to wake up everyday and I hope to keep improving and getting better with every mix!  Thank you so much for your kind thoughts and feedback. I greatly appreciate it! P.s. I am a big fan of your mixes too :)

Commandrew11	Which movie's sequel was actually on par with/did better than the first? | 
Commandrew11	I was tossing a football around and accidentally hit this 19 year old in the face, instead of shrugging it off because I was a kid he got infuriated and said "I'm telling your mom" and went and informed my parents. They didn't do anything. He was duly disappointed
Commandrew11	I could be wrong but I believe OP was directing it towards men who blame women for the fact that they don't get what they want from women -- "She's so shallow for turning me down on a date" or "Why can't girls just love me for me, all women can die." It's your fault you don't get the girl and you have no one else to blame. I could be wrong though.

Commandrew11	What do you think of the iPhone X? | 
Commandrew11	Post your best motivational quote | 
Commandrew11	[This](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/03/31/managing-depression/) article is really good
Commandrew11	Life
Commandrew11	Cool Ranch and Nacho Cheese
Commandrew11	I'm having the worst stomach pain right now and it's been going on for about four or five hours...oddly enough right when I hopped on Reddit it went away
Commandrew11	Good for you. Drown out these other bullcrap comments about gayness. Hanging out with and connecting with another man one on one has nothing wrong with it and I'm glad you made a friend.
Commandrew11	Congratulations bro, you seem to think like I do...I quit PMO in the very same ways, with a disciplined routine and lifestyle and still maintain it to this day, like you I put internet filters on all computers and cut almost everything I indulged in out. You're a good man, keep going and don't forget the monster gets you worst when you think you've got it beat and you're not even watching
Commandrew11	Same here
Commandrew11	The reason I stick around is to offer advice and help people out where I can...I was exactly where all of you were, couple times a day, no hope, etc. and now I just check up to see what people are saying and offering my advice if people ask. 
Commandrew11	Wow. I'm almost religious about exercising every day, eating healthily, eating breakfast, "chilling out" and de-stressing in a way, getting a good nights sleep, being active etc. etc. and I've seen little change in 3 weeks. It's not bad but it's annoying enough it fires me up in the mirror. Who knows, maybe things will turn around
Commandrew11	How did you get rid of your acne?
Commandrew11	Because I strongly believe that NoFap *is* a lifestyle. You can't just tell me quitting porn didn't change who you are. Because it did, even for this guy
Commandrew11	I like your thinking, but I wouldn't call it not a lifestyle outright, because NoFap is a lifestyle.  When people like myself say stuff like "NoFap isn't just a challenge, it's a lifestyle," what we *really* mean is that NoFap isn't just about keeping your hands out of your pants. The mother of NoFap is discipline, and by endeavoring in NoFap the demand of willpower and discipline it calls for will bleed into every other area in your life (at least it should). Exercise habits, eating habits, whatever, stuff outside of PMO. Basically meaning that success in NoFap isn't just overcoming a challenge, It's a change in *lifestyle*, because NoFap doesn't just promote retention. It promotes discipline. To me, NoFap is hitting that last pushup in the set you don't feel like doing or waking up at 6:30 because it applies to porn urges as well. In my eyes, NoFap is a lifestyle and a synonym to discipline.  Just my thoughts, I get what you're saying though
Commandrew11	This is very methodical lol you seem like a logical thinker
Commandrew11	In all seriousness I've been off snapchat for a little while now and the benefits are really worth it...I think clearer and I'm overall more satisfied with life, give it a go if you're looking for a little more bump to the "superpowers"
Commandrew11	Porn
Commandrew11	NoFap should become your life. Don't waver from it.
Commandrew11	And when you pay back mortgages, you're supposed to pay the amount you received PLUS ten percent. So if you mortgaged let's say Oriental Ave for $50 or whatever it is, when you unmortgage it, it's actually $55 to do so.
Commandrew11	What are some business tactics (used anywhere...commercials, storefronts, in-person) used by retailers and fast food restaurants to get you to purchase more? | 
Commandrew11	They play on each other. Depression makes you do those things. Those things worsen your depression. The worsened depression strengthens the draw to do those things...and so on
Commandrew11	"Do you even try in the morning?"
Commandrew11	Last paragraph was gold
Commandrew11	Adrenaline junkies of Reddit: What was your most exciting/adrenaline-filled moment? | 
Commandrew11	My parents are on vacation leaving me to look after my bros and sisters...and I off-handedly said "bonus points to whoever grabs my phone" as a joke. They took it seriously and wanted more.  Now they do whatever I want
Commandrew11	What is your favorite deodorant/cologne scent that men wear and which ones are not? | [removed]
Commandrew11	gettingstronger.org
Commandrew11	It depends. I should probably mention as a disclaimer that I am 17 and almost everyone I know in my circles uses social media. I deleted snapchat and instagram off my phone for about a month or so, and I never use my Facebook) basically meaning that the only way I could contact others was through text messaging, email, or calling. After the 30 days were up I went back again.  Sometimes people might tell you you'll look at instagram posts and snapchat stores and go "maaan I wish my life were more exciting and I was living the dream like that. I'm kind of a loser." It does, *if your life is actually boring.* One thing you might defend social media for is the flipside: when you *are* doing something awesome you want to share it with all of your friends so they can say "woww bro so cool" and you feel even better. IMO, just live a cool life, but don't live it for other people. Live it for you.  The point? For me, social media amplified my current mood 10x, and personally, it's not worth it. I was either down in the dumps or in the clouds, and it was all based on whether or not I got comments or likes or replies or whatever. Now think about that for a second: Holistically, it sounds pretty stupid to have your mood dependent on something as dumb as likes, replies, or snaps, not to mention most of the men I want to be like don't really care about the opinions of others in the first place. To be concerned about likes or whatever...It's dumb.  On my little break I was waaay more focused on schoolwork and less distracted, and I also got way better sleep as well. I wasn't staying up waiting for so-and-so to post or text or snap or whatever. Better sleep leads to better health in general, and I valued face-to-face interaction more than texting. So...  I just think it's stupid to let your mood and life revolve around the opinions of others. As Rockell from barbie and the dreamhouse says...'Everybody look at meeeeee!' Try it and see what works for you.

Commandrew11	They're just trying to help man lol
Commandrew11	Driving with the window rolled down on the freeway...I just like the wind in my face but I generally forget when they start yelling the answer to my question, and I roll the window up
Commandrew11	Porn
Commandrew11	I'm playing online, I can't pause and take out the trash
Commandrew11	A quote I love to tell myself is "Don't go chasing butterflies. They will just fly away. But if you sit still, they will come and land softly on your shoulder."
Commandrew11	Football
Commandrew11	That whole third paragraph hits home. I quit video games for that very reason...It was hilarious but also disturbing to watch YouTube videos of parents that had smashed xboxes or deleted hard drives of hardcore gamers, and to see them lose their entire shiz...It's like their entire life was smashed to bits and they had to start all over because their life was on a hard drive. Hang in there fellas
Commandrew11	How long for the universe?
Commandrew11	You are not a failure. The failures are the ones who do not even attempt at NoFap, who stand on the sidelines mocking and ridiculing our practices, without even giving it a shot. IMO, If you are here wanting to change, you are not failing. You might be at rock bottom, but in this fight the way you're facing is more important than where you are.  Contrary to popular belief, winners fail a lot. The failures in life are the ones who fail to *try*, because that's what's important. Hang in there man
Commandrew11	My man! Thanks for posting this
Commandrew11	He's a poet and he doesn't even...think he is Nice post
Commandrew11	Once I won a Nerf sweepstakes and got a free trip to Florida. 22,000 entries were submitted. I was one of 86 that went.
Commandrew11	Might sound cliche or bandwagon-ish but mine is Politik (Coldplay) for sure...I always get the chills the last 2 minutes
Commandrew11	For everyone it's different. If you can achieve results while playing every once in a while, you can totally go ahead. For some (like me) we have two modes of video game consumption: "hi" and "off." There is no in-between. Some people can control their indulgences and some people either play for days on end or not at all, so we have to eliminate it completely, everyone's different
Commandrew11	You know what's weird? People mock processes. People don't mock results. They laugh at a fat guy running on a treadmill. They laugh when you tell them you haven't fapped in three months. They laugh when you tell them "I don't drink" and they laugh when you tell them you won't play video games. People don't laugh at a six pack. Or benching 250 pounds. Or acquiring wealth or quick mental clarity or a lack of stress. They just wonder where you got it. Makes me think.   Being disciplined is not easy. People will laugh at you for it and think you're crazy. Just be patient and you'll come out on top.

Commandrew11	I'm the same I love driving. I had to wake up for a 6 AM meeting today that was about 60 miles away and I couldn't wait to drive home. I love the freeway. I don't drive just to drive though, I don't like wasting gas, but I do love to drive.
Commandrew11	My man *high five*
Commandrew11	Incorrect grammar. Like come on you get what the guy is saying, you don't have to be petty about the stupid grammar if you understand what he is saying because you feel powerless and desire control in your life. In the end, why does it matter? You're just being judgmental. Sheesh.   Lol sometimes the grammar nazis bug me more than they're irritated by the incorrect language.
Commandrew11	Cheesecake. Why would you mix a tangy dairy with sweet sugary frosting and stuff? Never understood it
Commandrew11	"It's better to be respected than it is to be popular. Popularity ends on yearbook day. Respect lasts forever"
Commandrew11	I haven't had one single urge for over a year. I feel the exact same way. Thanks for your story

Commandrew11	Happens every two weeks for me although sometimes they don't even feature women  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Commandrew11	I listen to the same one, I think it features Seriously, Just Don't Do It and $ave the Fap
Commandrew11	This is my problem. Even this website I use as an excuse to visit the internet every once in a while. The porn is over with but I feel as though I'll struggle with digital stimulation and entertainment for the rest of my life.
Commandrew11	Is there a purple rocket badge T-shirt I can buy? Because I would wear that every day
Commandrew11	It's a period your body goes through during porn addiction recovery where your libido is totally dead, you have no motivation for anything, you might feel depressed, etc. Most are tempted to go back to porn usage at this point just to make sure everything's working but DON'T because things FOR SURE ARE working down there. Just be patient
Commandrew11	Great stuff. DON'T EVER test yourself in a flatline. You'll regret it 100% of the time.
Commandrew11	This turned into a medical health discussion forum really fast

Commandrew11	Which is worse, personality-wise: total control freak or indifferent? | 
Commandrew11	When I go to the kitchen most of the time it's to do two things: make cereal and get a glass of water. One time I switched the two and grabbed a bowl, dispensing water into it from the fridge, and then caught myself wondering what on earth I was doing.
Commandrew11	I searched for about 20 minutes for my lanyard keychain because I wanted to go somewhere. Not only did I return to my room 6 times knowing full well they weren't there, they were around my neck the entire time I was looking.
Commandrew11	I was at the park for a large family reunion, and the park had lots of bike trails in the backways that you could ride through, so my entire family ended up bringing their own bikes. Someone had brought a black bike ramp (kinda small-ish) and my sister and I had convinced my brother, who was probably 8 or 9 at the time, to go full speed towards the jump.   It looked exactly like an AFV vid. He splatted on his face. It wasn't funny in the moment. but I chuckle when I think of it
Commandrew11	Whats the manliest hobby you can think of? | 
Commandrew11	Exact same thing. Porn oddly enough hasn't posed a serious problem for about two years, but I love wasting time, eating crap, playing video games and just being dumb. I need to get out of the house more.
Commandrew11	Yeah, this is probably even worse than PMO. Did you take a cold shower immediately afterwards?
Commandrew11	Love this idea, will check up on your blog. Congratulations
Commandrew11	One thing that seems upside down to me is when you spend months and months trying to get girls and acting desperate, and then after a while you're like "what on earth am I doing" and you finally gain perspective on girls, understand what achieving them really means, and see that they don't even matter and you don't even care about them much anymore, THEN they actually roll around and start liking you. Dumbest law of nature ever. The guys who care about it the least get them the most.
Commandrew11	Nah things are better now, I have more energy and my face has cleared up my acne, more motivation etc., but about the same amount of girls find me attractive now as when I was in the middle of  the porn addiction, if not less. I've experienced superpowers but I guess I have to work a little harder for the women. It's slightly discouraging but I know in the back of my head porn will only make everything worse 
Commandrew11	Still hasn't kicked in, but I'm being patient
Commandrew11	This is amazing. Great post
Commandrew11	Reddit employees and workers alike: What is the most upset your boss has ever been towards you? | 
Commandrew11	IMO you should stay away from the prostitution too.
Commandrew11	Thanks for the motivation man. Ill hit the weights again
Commandrew11	Yeah that makes sense. What's weird is that I lifted for around a 6-week period in the middle of the day rather than in the morning, but the reason I started going to morning was because I could just "get it over with" and have the rest of the day to relax and not worry about my workout. My philosophy behind it was that all day during school during the 6-week period I lifted in the middle of the day I would think "I have a workout this afternoon" and it would feel like a burden, I'd almost get nervous so I'd rather just wake up early, get it over with, and then chill out for the rest of the day.  I will say though that the whole time I was playing football I was very dedicated and committed, and I always pushed myself as hard as I absolutely could, so when I tried to get back into lifting again, I always pushed myself very hard because if I didn't feel sore or tired I would walk out of there uneasy, as though my workout "wasn't complete" and I could have done more and I was just taking the easy path by not doing anything hard. I had a fifteen minute treadmill routine that consisted of 15 minutes of non stop running (I hate running and I suck at it, I'm more of a sprinter) and for the first 14 I would run a steady pace, then the last minute I would bump it up 2 or 3 mph and sprinted as hard as I could for 60 seconds. I was always hacking and wheezing after their routine and so glad I got it over with. So maybe by pushing myself really hard and making myself "afraid" of my workouts it was more of a burden than a joy? Maybe because my workouts were something to try and live through rather than have fun?   I dunno. Maybe that's it. Thanks for the help. It was more of a burden or a chore rather than something I was excited about working towards, now that I think about it.  
Commandrew11	I'm more a fan of the psychological benefits, I'm actually ok with my body type/size
Commandrew11	lol captcha broke, computers running NoFap now
Commandrew11	I've given up lifting because I always felt tired the entire day and lethargic if i did it in the morning, I didn't feel like socializing or going out, and I never felt like talking to people. It's not that it was super hard or anything, I just hated being tired the entire day. I lifted for two years doing football and didn't see a massive improvement although I did get gains when I was on a good streak, but socializing is a priority for me, so can someone prove me wrong? Did I just not give it enough time or something?
Commandrew11	Really changes the perspective and helps me see things from the girls' point of view. Thanks for this  EDIT: I should probably ask if you ever end up reading this, from all of the benefits guys experience after going on a long streak, are girls kind of the same? What happens when a female stops PMOing?
Commandrew11	A milestone | Sheesh. 500 days. Looking back at everything that's happened I've really taken for granted my triple-digit streak, as though porn is out of my life and another day is well, another day. I don't think of it anymore. It's become typical for me to go months without even thinking about porn, something that most people sadly cannot do. I am so grateful for my ability to shake this off, seeing that three years ago I thought I'd never make it past a month. I am so thankful for this sub and its constant support that it has brought for all of us, anywhere from motivation to science to strategies and tips. NoFap is such a great thing and has changed so many lives, including my own.  Be thankful for NoFap guys. I thought I'd give you a little motivation to kick off this milestone.  Guys just as the one and only slim shady would say, "you can do anything you set your mind to." I firmly believe that. If you put your heart and soul into it, and you believe you can accomplish what you're focused on, there really is no limit to what you can achieve. If you really do want to quit porn and experience some of the benefits people are talking about, put everything you've got into quitting. Make it your number one priority. Tape a paper to your mirror: "I will be strong today." Something, anything. Do whatever it takes and do not back down. Get pissed at what porn has belittled you into. Treat pornography like a monster and every day is a battle. At the end of the day a victor will be determined and it had better be you. Do not give up and envision yourself beating the addiction because **you can do it.** Especially if I can. And when you relapse (because it will happen, you're not going to go from 3 times a day to 400 days overnight) get back up and try again. Cry for an hour then get back on the horse. Don't tell yourself it's ok, because it's not, but don't be pessimistic either. Get a longer streak this time and give quitting this habit everything you have. Remember: water cuts through boulders not because of its strength, size, speed, or force, but because of its persistence. One thing I liked that Eric Thomas said in one of his motivational speeches:  "*Most of you say you want to be successful, but you don't want it bad. You just kinda want it. You don't want it badder than you want to party. You don't want it as much as you want to be cool, and most of you don't want success as much as you want to sleep!*"  If you want to quit porn, fight. You've got to want it with everything you have. It should be your #1 priority. You can win!  As far as advice is concerned I have a little:  Develop discipline in every area of your life. Physical exercise, homework, diet, social skills, women etc. etc. Because discipline in other areas of your life spills over into quitting habits, and it overall gives you greater self-confidence and an ability to trust yourself. It will give you willpower to quit. If you're completely liberal in every area in your life, it's going to be difficult to tell yourself to be disciplined in only one. Learn the principle of discipline and master it.  Another thing I would recommend quitting video games. For around 200 days or so porn never even got a thought. As soon as I accidentally stumbled across something mildly pornographic online I would turn away immediately. During this time period I would occasionally indulge in fast food and watch movies with friends, but it never got out of hand and the two things I was "no-debate (haha) absolutely no bending on were PMO and video games. " However it being spring break at my school I decided to play some Battlefield 2 and NCAA 14 with my brothers and the urges came right back. It only took about fifteen minutes. Do not waste time playing video games. Not only are they (IMO) detrimental to your mental health but they also give you a false sense of achievement, like you're actually worth something because you got to level 7 or something. Live in the real world.  Develop discipline and give the addiction everything you've got. Develop a fire in you. I know you can do it!  Thanks for reading. And if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to ask.

howdoichangemywifi	Late game burst | Where does Vladimir's late game burst come from? Is it from his charged E or his ult or is it a combination of both?
howdoichangemywifi	Yeah if you have any questions, you should check out the vlad mains subreddit. They've been super helpful 
howdoichangemywifi	I can play a ton of mid-laners but recently, I've been having the most fun playing Vladimir. It's fun going into a teamfight by yourself and like coming out with full health. Vladimir is limited by his empowered Q so it's almost like a mini-game to play around that

howdoichangemywifi	Can confirm. Rubik's Cube DeCal is super easy and super fun. I went in knowing nothing and I came out with a new skill: finishing the Rubik's cube. There's two sections, beginners and advanced. The beginners one is the one I was in and the final was to solve the cube once in 5 minutes (which is super super doable). I'm forgetting what the final was for the advanced class but it's also very doable

howdoichangemywifi	From my time here, I've heard from some people that people usually take:  Liandries: 3+ tanks on the enemy team or even 2 really, really tanky champions. Liandries will melt through tanks    Zzrot: assassins on the other team. The defensive stats from Zzrot help with dealing with their burst and also the passive move speed near turrets is really nice when you're trying to land a wall. People won't expect the movespeed and get caught out 
howdoichangemywifi	Dealing with Taliyah | I've been playing a lot of Anivia, but recently I've been losing games to Taliyah. How should I play against her? Should I just farm up and help out in team fights or try for lane pressure? Also which summoner spells should I run and should I build MR against her?

He's super genuine, informative, and his lectures are absolutely fantastic. If I could, I wish I took Prof Knapp's classes again and again. You're in damn good hands for that class. 
howdoichangemywifi	Anivia counters | So I've been playing anivia for a while now, but I'm not sure about who counters her. The only match-up that I've had trouble with is versus Taliyah.

howdoichangemywifi	PM please
howdoichangemywifi	I used to do that too. I would get into 1v1s and RR, block a couple of skillshots but not do as much damage as I was accustomed to doing with old Leblanc. I just kept playing Leblanc to get better with the combo. It's pretty much you keep trying and trying over and over again. One thing that helped me was realizing the damage on her mimicked abilities. According to some post here, mimic W only does more damage than the other mimicked abilities after level 16. I think mimicked Q does more damage till then.  Considering that and her passive, I would use the 1.5 second window to think about what to press. Of course, this won't be possible every game or every time but it helps when you're starting to relearn her.   Hope this helped

howdoichangemywifi	Sometimes if I get ganked by a jungler and I manage to damage either the laner or the jungler and they decide to tower dive me I'll E->W the one who receives tower damage for the 2 second root and maybe get a free kill.
howdoichangemywifi	I specifically looked up "teamfights with riven" and all I got were guides with no teamfight info. There's no need to be mean about someone who actually has a mental disorder.
howdoichangemywifi	Teamfighting with Riven | [removed]
howdoichangemywifi	For the new one, you just need MS against her. If you can dodge her q's (especially in lane) you'll do fine. Also, if you do fight her, remember to turn back when she ults because her stun is really really long.
howdoichangemywifi	I just recently picked up Ryze, but I've been playing mid lane for my entire league career.   First of all, you need to understand yasuo if you want to counter him (so you pretty much need to know how he works and play him, if you want to win). The biggest fact that you should abuse is his windwall cd. It's like 18-20 seconds at rank 1 and yasuo will probably never max it because then they'll lose out of damage. Also, for his q, it's a skill shot, not a targeted ability, so in theory, it's possible to dodge it (not 100% of the time, but still possible). And lastly, yasuo's e. This is what makes his kit so annoying even without the windwall because if you're fighting in a wave of minions, you'll definitely miss your q's. However, if he jumps on you with his e, make sure to be able to root him. The reason for why ryze is so strong right now is that ryze has a targeted snare that's not even a skill shot or anything and this thing along with the E - W can stop even the trickiest of Fizz mains because of the root. The 2 second root gives enough time for you to put some of your combo down, get the shield from the runes, proc your movement speed and storm raider's surge. As ryze you just have to pay attention to yasuo's windwall.   I think it's more important for your jungler to pay attention to yasuo. If you can set him back enough in lane, there's a good chance you can set him back for the game. He's only good when he gets easy and early kills. Since his only escape is e and flash, if he gets away from minions, he can't escape so he has to flash. This brings me to my other point. If your jungler does decide to gank, you need to wait for the third q (the whirlwind) to be used. Because that's yasuo's main form of cc.   Of course if that doesn't help, just do what I do and ban yasuo every game!  Hope this helps

skedadler	I am 1 game off 1000 normal wins? | I hear that you get to play with a Riot employee for your 1000th normal win? That would be so great :D

skedadler	The same thing happens with Azir occasionally.  
skedadler	Literally everybody In my year group played League at the time. I thought it sounded kinda dumb and I remember saying "Yeah I dont really like games like runescape". Eventually I was pressured into playing it and now Im the only one playing out of all the people in my year.
skedadler	I recently picked up kha a couple weeks ago and I was in the same boat as you, but I just kept playing him and now he is one of my favorites. I actually got my first Pentakill with him yesterday.  Jungle Path:  Start red->chickens->crab->blue->gromp->crab->wolves->Krugs->Back   It sound pretty weird but I find that it works for me. You can pretty much do a full clear with plenty of health left over. I usually don't touch the krugs until my second clear because Kha'Zix doesn't benefit from the passive they give you due to his low attack speed.  Ability Order:  I max my Q as soon as possible and then my W. If you want the extra sustain put one extra point into your W. Evolve Q and E and then whether you upgrade your R or W is up to you.  Runes and Masteries:  I use standard AD jungle Runes and here is the mastery page I use: http://i.imgur.com/OTuFoM1.png  My health after my first clear: http://i.imgur.com/pQXcpfv.png This is without a leash, so If you can get one even better.  Hope this helps :)  
skedadler	A humble request for the next batch or texture updates. | Please make make masked shaco's in-game model reflect his splash art better. That splash I think is one of the prettiest in the game and I feel that the model lets it down. For those of you who dont know what i am talking about: http://imgur.com/w4MgK Edit: I see the typo :(
skedadler	Thank you very much :D 
skedadler	I have recently picked up Kha'Zix, I find him really fun but I really struggle on his first few jungle clears. Any advice on jungle paths or runes and masteries. Any advice would be nice :D

TalisFletcher	Who is that one stranger you still sometimes think about? | 
TalisFletcher	> pish is Scottish for piss  Are you Sean Connery?
TalisFletcher	Actually the quote is missing the second half. Intact it reads:  > Helen of Troy. The face that launched a thousand ships...in the opposite direction.
TalisFletcher	Is that not from Lawrence of Arabia?
TalisFletcher	Ever thought of applying for The X Factor?
TalisFletcher	It's actually pronounced *sooch* and is Italian for prosthetic sock.
TalisFletcher	That's it? The joke works way better as is. I was convinced there wasn't a third option and the joke was exactly that. Still a good joke.
TalisFletcher	Well, I'm thick.
TalisFletcher	I was murdering a man in cold blood, officer. Why do you ask?
TalisFletcher	Thank you.
TalisFletcher	I'm clearly in the latter category.
TalisFletcher	I've only seen one episode of the original series. I didn't much care for it simply because it felt like Get Smart taking itself way too seriously.
TalisFletcher	Won't that be bad for the book?
TalisFletcher	They prefer to be called the living impaired.
TalisFletcher	There's one thing I've never quite got. It may be an STD but somebody has to get it first to pass it on.
TalisFletcher	What if they got a tattoo of a foot?
TalisFletcher	My girlfriend is Dutch. If she were to do that, her orgasm would have been over for 20min by the time she got through half of her middle names.
TalisFletcher	...
TalisFletcher	Oof. Sorry, mate.
TalisFletcher	George should be campaigning for more men in the workplace.
TalisFletcher	Not much. I'm in bed and naked already.
TalisFletcher	On mobile that doesn't work so I see a lot of comments that are 90% up symbols. I had no idea why people were writing such stupid comments and why they were being upvoted for a long time.
TalisFletcher	The two least Indian Indian dishes.
TalisFletcher	This would be great for me as a filmmaker. I can use anybody's music or stock footage without having to pay for it.
TalisFletcher	I'm sure there are other laws that will come into play. I'm not sure I'd be able to trespass onto a plane, for instance.
TalisFletcher	Why did you pay ~$15 for it?
TalisFletcher	r/tree
TalisFletcher	Tax avoidance isn't a crime anyway.
TalisFletcher	I'm sorry to use you as a pseudo WebMD without paying you. I don't get blood in my stool but when wiping I often catch a little dab of blood. Is this anything to worry about or am I just wiping too deep of roughly or something?
TalisFletcher	*eye twitches*
TalisFletcher	Cheaper too because you only have to hire one actor.
TalisFletcher	I want this life. Although, it does require us both to have jobs that allow us to work from home which would suit me fine but my future partner probably has other ideas.
TalisFletcher	Meh, our version's better.
TalisFletcher	> with the lights off  I've got the countdown clock going for the first time you trip over something and break each other's limbs.
TalisFletcher	That's my goal in life. I don't care if I don't get a really well paying job. I just want something that can pay all my bills with enough left over to save or buy the odd thing that comes up.
TalisFletcher	That doesn't rhyme.
TalisFletcher	I just put it off and after a few months it'll be right again.
TalisFletcher	r/nocontext  Doubly so because the comment is removed.
TalisFletcher	No.
TalisFletcher	But the bird in Winter flies highest with geese.
TalisFletcher	I have no shame in being insecure.
TalisFletcher	It used to bother me a lot. There was a clock where I worked while in high school and every day I wanted to change it but it would have meant getting out the ladder, getting the clock down, manually resetting it, putting it back and then packing the ladder away.  Naturally, that would take too long so I wasn't allowed to. After 6 months, it was correct again. I wonder if that's where I got my sense of apathy from...
TalisFletcher	I'm assuming this was correcting 'savant' to 'servant'? Oddly enough, both words could work in this instance.
TalisFletcher	Sounds like good fun!
TalisFletcher	🖕
TalisFletcher	20ft? I can hit the dogs in the park from my balcony!
TalisFletcher	I'm not crying...
TalisFletcher	Goodbye 
TalisFletcher	M

TalisFletcher	Time. I remember when I was 6 thinking the years going on forever. After that, each year goes by so much faster. I make plans to have a project done by next year and I run out of time to finish it. What the fuck?
TalisFletcher	The Countdown theme. If you're not finished in 30 seconds, you lose.
TalisFletcher	That's pretty unacceptable at 2, really. I just call them late night snacks and have them when I feel like it.
TalisFletcher	I feel this is a missed opportunity. Sticking pens in your butt? Fine, whatever.  I want to see people drawing pictures with the pen in their butt, dammit!

TalisFletcher	I saw a Japanese film years ago about a family that ran a small country hotel. One night, a sumo wrestler and his girlfriend booked a room. In the morning, when there was no response from them, the family went inside to find him face down on the bed, dead.  They call the police and, with lots of help, they lift him off only to discover his girlfriend underneath him also dead. They'd been having sex and he had a heart attack when he came and collapsed on her causing her to suffocate.  Goodnight, everyone.
TalisFletcher	Oh, I hate that feeling. It's really painful for me. I actually get it worse in my feet stepping into a shower.
TalisFletcher	Um... This is either a joke I don't get or somebody's switched over to metric time.
TalisFletcher	At least after claiming, it's yours and you can pass it on. I'm not sure but I have a feeling that if you die before you claim it, the inheritor of your estate can't claim your winnings.
TalisFletcher	I'll let you know.
TalisFletcher	Only if I see a cute bitch.
TalisFletcher	Old people in hospital or nursing homes with loved ones around them. Everyone's prepared for it. In most cases, it's not nice but it's certainly easier to handle and may be a relief if they've been in pain for some time.
TalisFletcher	I think it's inevitable that there is life out there but chances are it's not in a form we recognise. Here is normally where I'd put some examples of life different to our own to illustrate my point but it is so hard to imagine life as being something other than movement, sentience and the 5 major senses.
TalisFletcher	I wanted a girlfriend but not like this...
TalisFletcher	Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?
TalisFletcher	I did actually tear up a little. Johnny Vegas is one of those performers who pretends to be a lot dimmer than he really is.
TalisFletcher	Who'd have thought that a half thought through remark made at 6AM would overtake my previous highest comment? Also, just looking at my top comments, you'd think I was a particular kind of person. Oh dear.
TalisFletcher	Arthur Conan Doyle wished that he wouldn't only be remembered as the man who wrote Sherlock Holmes.  Whoops.
TalisFletcher	Dogs will like what I tell them to like.
TalisFletcher	As far as hobbies go...
TalisFletcher	I didn't used to like Angela Barnes but she's really grown on me. This episode she was great. Her "unprecedented" joke was brutal. I wished it had gotten a bigger reaction.
TalisFletcher	At some point you have to make a choice. If everything is for $1.07, then it isn't a dollar store. It's a dollar and 7 cent store.  Change the price or change the name.
TalisFletcher	If I have a long session, my skin feels all lovely and smooth afterwards.
TalisFletcher	Just grab a tissue, flute it and stick it up your nose with a twist and a flourish.  Also, if the blood nose lasts longer than 20min, see your doctor.
TalisFletcher	Well, that is "where the sun don't shine", after all.
TalisFletcher	I'm 22 and I have some friends my age from school but most are in their late 20s at the very least. One of my best friends is in his late 40s. It doesn't help that I'm usually the youngest person at anything to do with my job simply because it's not an area that a lot of young people go into.
TalisFletcher	Was that a parody of a UK ad we don't get down under?
TalisFletcher	Oh, my.
TalisFletcher	Sounds like a good idea to me.
TalisFletcher	If you're stuck for ideas, try [walking like John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV2ViNJFZC8).
TalisFletcher	What's his hair like when he's out and about?
TalisFletcher	Well, forgive me for saying so but if you pick and choose the rules you follow, you don't like good syntax and proper grammar anywhere near as much as you professed.
TalisFletcher	A Greek and a Roman are having an argument over whose civilisation is the greatest. The Greek says 'We built the Parthenon!' and the Roman replies 'Well, we built the Colleseum!' The Greek says 'We invented mathematics!' and the Roman says 'But we had the Roman empire.'  The Greek thinks for a moment and comes up with the ultimate clincher. He says 'We invented sex.' to which the Roman replies 'Yes. But we thought of having it with women.'
TalisFletcher	Don't worry. It won't.  Also, might I suggest the subreddit r/grool if you're not already subscribed?
TalisFletcher	I wouldn't call him unskilled but there's an Australian band from the late 70s/80s called Australian Crawl. They've got some great songs but the lead singer, James Reyne, has some really appalling diction. It makes it hard to understand the lyrics sometimes.  For instance, it took me far too long to realise that the second line of 'Oh, No, Not You Again' (a great song) was not:  > She was such a pretty thing, man what a horse  I'll leave you to work out what it actually is.
TalisFletcher	I'm wondering whether this is a test because all of your Is should be in upper case.
TalisFletcher	Provided we're not going too young, I don't think there's anything too wrong here. The half your age +7 rule puts you at 16. Apparently we're maturing younger and younger as a species as well. A 14 year old today could well look like an 18 year old from 30 years ago.  I do sound and lighting as my job and I did a school show a year or two ago. The lead was 14 and I nearly didn't believe it when I was told. I would have sworn she was much older.
TalisFletcher	Okay, I really have to read more carefully this late at night. Hoo boy.
TalisFletcher	I'd be happy to give you a free appraisal.
TalisFletcher	Is this one intentional?
TalisFletcher	I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.
TalisFletcher	Hear that? That's the sound of 3.5 billion men all shutting their legs.
TalisFletcher	I feel ya.
TalisFletcher	I was very concerned someone had chopped their knob off in a machine and they couldn't find it.
TalisFletcher	I'm in that boat at the moment. There's a girl who's just started talking to me at a group thing once a week. She could be interested in me and is a bit shy or she could just be making friends.  I'm unsure of how to tell.
TalisFletcher	He's having it sewn up.
TalisFletcher	I'm just imagining people fucking to the beat of the Old El Paso 'Why not both?' music now.
TalisFletcher	There's hope for the Albinos yet.
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	If everyone got married in work attire (like servicemen sometimes do), what would be the funniest outfits? | 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Ohmygodddd this is my fave
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	*bee good
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	"We are gathered here today because the stars have aligned for Mr and Mrs Astronaut" 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Maybe just nod their heads really vigorously at that point? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I'm from the UK, what does a hot dog on a stick worker wear? I'm picturing just someone dressed up as a hotdog 😂🌭
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I think it's really normal to have night time guests in the UK, and if they're coming to the hen/stag do and are still a part of your big day (evening or both day/night) I'd say it's fine :)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I really like #LoveIsInTheAyres!

PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	What's your FHs first initial? You could do (using H as an example initial here) HandBBranham?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	This sounds awesome! Where abouts are you exploring in the UK? ^.^
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Your dress is so beautiful and it fits you perfectly! 😍 can't wait to see more! Where did you get it? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Oh my god! I laughed out loud at the other campers thinking you were Joe and Jane the next morning! That is too too funny. 😂 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Good lord. That's... That's some psycho stuff right there. Congrats on having a FH and future in laws that have your back though! Eeeeesh.
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	It's gorgeous! (of course your clutch is beautiful too! I just got way too excited about your dress haha and didn't mention your clutch!) 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Your dress is beautiful! ❤ where is it from? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Jon in glasses tho 😍
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	You both look adorable! I love photos were you can tell people are in love! ❤❤
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Can anyone help me find this dress? (or something similar?) | 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I'd definitely clean it now! That way if there's a permenent stain or something that doesn't come out when you get it dry cleaned, you've still got two years to find a replacement! Hopefully you won't need to do that though! :)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I've tried to post this before but it didn't work: I found this image on Pinterest and have not been able to find a source for the dress anywhere! I've reversed google image searched it, and all it shows me is more Pinterest boards! It is so beautiful, delicate and romantic... Does anyone know what it is? Or anything similar?! Thanks in advance! 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Wow that is gorgeous! It fits you perfectly :) where did you find it?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I'm in a similar position, my FH has 8 or 9 groomsmen, plus a best man. I've got 3 BMs and my amazing MOH. At first I was trying to think of who else I could include to get the numbers up but I decided not to worry about it! The way I looked at it was if I tried to force extra people into my bridesmaid group that I'm not super close to, I think I'd regret it. Enjoy spending the time with your nearest and dearest - with all relationships it's quality over quantity, and no ones gonna think anything of the numbers not matching! (and if they do - who cares?! It's your day not theirs!)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	A play on 'more than' might work for Morgan. MorganForvever? LoveYouMorganAnything? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Something boat themed like HMSMartinez or MartinezSetsSail could work?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	These are awesome! I've never seen anything like this before but I love it! So cute 😊
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I absolutely love this idea! Great thinking on if you have loads leftover that it's something you can use!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	If you want easy AND inexpensive - consider a food truck. Me and FH are vegan and the front runner ATM is a pizza van. They'll serve for 4 hours baking fresh pizzas, and for 200 people I've got multiple quotes in the range of £1,200 - £1,600. 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Hahaa this is amazing 😂
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I've been looking at Lulu's dresses! Do you have pics of you and your bridesmaids /u/seekaterun? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	O.o Jeez, that's awful. Your poor grams, and poor you! You sound like a very compassionate person to still be even inviting your mom. I know she's ill but those things she says are horrible! I guess if she is definitely going to be there, it's just a risk you have to take unfortunately. 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	PS, in regards to the speeches, could you ask your Grandma to say a few words? Maybe put her on mom watch as well, so you don't have to be worrying about her all day. Seriously, find someone you trust and make keeping an eye on your mom their responsibility for one day. You're there to celebrate marrying your FH, not spending the day on edge thinking about your mom. 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Yay!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Unfortunately I don't have an anecdote as my wedding isn't for another 2 years (I discovered this sub really early!) but I had to comment and send you my sympathy. The fact that your friend has forgotten about your bachelorette is ridiculous, you don't in any way sound like a brat about either that or being on edge about your mom being unstable. It sounds rough but you have an amazing support network right here on weddit, and I guess the two things to focus on is that you'll have your two most important people there on the big day, and at the end of it, you'll be married to your FH. When you're feeling stressed just try and focus on that and only that. You can't control what other people do, and it's natural to feel worried or let down by it. But you're blessed to be marrying the love of your life, and at the end of everything, that's what matters. Sending a big hug your way from the UK
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Hey! I found a brand called Brighton Belle who are mostly under 500. I've been looking at ordering one over from the States from a site called Lulus.com, and Etsy has loads of pretty dresses. My budgets similar to yours at absolute max as we're completely paying for the wedding ourselves, so I'll keep an eye on this thread!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I really like #2! (plus the bonus cat🐱)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	The last dress you posted is the exact one I'm looking at! It's so pretty, I love what you've done with separating it! (also I love the black engagement dress!)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Dresses from Lulus? | I know there's loads of US brides on here, so have any of you ordered dresses from Lulus? I've found so many pretty ones but they seem so cheap? (which is great, we're on a budget but I don't want to get dress regret). Does anyone have photos they can share of their Lulu's dresses? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I know what you mean! I've stopped wearing dresses that show cleavage, but FH appreciates it so I'm thinking of incorporating it into my wedding dress. Thanks for the tip! I'm a UK size 10/12 so I'm thinking I might order a small and a medium and then send the wrong one back with the free returns!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Ah thank you! I should have checked but I'm on mobile. I'm surprised how positive all the comments are! I think I'm sold!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	We were originally thinking about a Friday wedding but realised our friends who are teachers won't be able to take the day off (wedding is in Sept '19). Not sure if you have teacher friends but it's worth thinking about as I wouldn't want anyone we're close to, to miss our wedding!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	ForeverAndAlwise?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	That dress it beautiful! The colour really suits you as well!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Hello! If this isn't gone already I'm interested! I'll PM you
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I asked my best friend from school if she would be my maid of honor and she said yes! She's been so amazing since then and has added about 60 pins to my Pinterest board and I love all of them! No one else has been anywhere near this excited and it's making me so happy! She was definitely the right choice, I love this girl! 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Your ring looks exactly like mine! Ring twins! <3
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Spotify playlist sharing for receptions / song suggestions? (Anything to get the guests dancing!) | Anyone think it might be useful to share either spotify playlists for receptions, or just any songs that are guaranteed to get the guests dancing? (Also I don't know if it's just me but it'd be so nice to know a bunch of other newlyweds have been dancing to the same songs around the world! <3 )
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Something I just remembered that might be useful for anyone wanting to get their guests dancing - it's so much easier to keep people on the dancefloor than to get them back up on the dancefloor - so when you're making a playlist and you think you've got a few dancy songs in there, don't randomly drop in something that would just be considered background music, people will take it as a chance to go to the bathroom/get a drink/rest their feet, then you've got to get them on the dancefloor all over again! (I had a lot of house parties when I was younger and had an almost scientific method of ordering my songs haha)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Ohh yeah! I think most people love funk/soul (my FH's best man loves James Brown haha, I know that will get him on the dance floor)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I know right?! Especially the white flesh ones and the flat (doughnut) nectarines <3 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	The dress is gorgeous! But your hair is just as beautiful! Dat colour tho.
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	On the 2nd picture your husbands face just shouts how did I get this lucky?! But then I got to the 4th pic and your face is saying exactly the same thing! So much love, too adorable <3 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	How many guests did you have and how many packs of film did you buy? I love this idea!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Yeah that's an awesome idea, most people like chips and dips so that will go down well! Ooo that sounds good (I love seitan!). It's great your caterer is willing to try out new things! Well I have a really food-conservative family who would definitely not try or like meat substitutes... I really want food trucks as we're doing an outdoor wedding and I love street food, so far I'm thinking pizza/loaded fries/maybe tacos, but some of the things my family don't like are: tomatoes, garlic, onions, any and all spices.... so for those picky ones I'm thinking I might make a homemade shepherds pie with meat-free mince and/or lentils, and serve that. One of the pickiest of my family members (my lovely Great-Aunty) comes for tea at my parents house every week so my Mum has agreed to make the shephards pie to my recipe and see if Great-Aunty likes it. She's our test audience! It's a tricky one though because I really want to make sure everyone is full and happy, food is such a central part of my life and it would really REALLY suck if people didn't eat or went home hungry.
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Haha! Well one suggestion from me is some Stevie Wonder - For Once in my Life is so romantic lyric-wise and such a happy song. I love Stevie <3 And depending on your crowd - I always find these get my friends dancing: Single Ladies, Billie-Jean, Dancing in the Moonlight, Dancing in the Street, Do I love you (Indeed I do), and War 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Hmm are you in America? I'm UK based and I haven't heard of anything like that here.
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Yes definitely! They are guaranteed crowd pleasers!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Oh my god! I absolutely **LOOOOOVE** Caravan Palace! We're from the UK and we saw them at Boomtown in 2015 (best festival ever) and again the last time they were in Manchester. I was so hungover, but they pulled me out of it and got me dancing even though I was drinking strictly water! Great suggestion! 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Oh my word! I love that delicate lace sleeve look <heart eye emoji> It's gorgeous! No wonder you fell in love with it! <3
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	> The Twist  awesome! what a great, upbeat, happy song! Did you have a DJ or your own playlist? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	This is an awesome photo! You two look perfect together! (And I love your back tat!)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I've been thinking about this too as by the time me and FH get married we'll have been living in our own house for 2+ years so won't need "traditional" gifts... what I'm thinking is just putting on the invite that all we want is for [our guests] to be at our wedding, but if they really want to get us a gift then a donation to our honeymoon fund would be appreciated. We're in England though so I dunno what the difference is. But basically saying we're not *expecting* anything, all we want is them to come celebrate with us. But if they're not comfortable with showing up with no gift, then to donate to the honeymoon fund. It's so hard isn't it, phrasing it?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I don't mean to be rude, your dress is beautiful, and elegant.. but that back is HOT yo. Your FH is gonna love it <3
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Long flowy dresses are so romantic and really do look fab next to ball gowns <3 Me and my mum both love the ones you suggested! That kind of length is great!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	I really like that idea! Just picking the color and then letting them pick the style and length. We're having an outdoor rustic kinda wedding, with hardly any traditional aspects, so I think it might look strange if their dresses are completely formal and uniform. Ooo do you have a photo of your bouquet? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Yaay! Vegan wedding crew! What food are you serving at yours? I know I think that's the route I'm gonna take. If they ask, I'll tell them but I'm not going to make a big announcement about it! 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Haha I will! What food did your friend provide? :)
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Personally I absolutely LOVE the circle skirts and sheaths but I'm worried they won't suit my bridesmaids! I haven't asked them all yet so once they know I want them to be my bridesmaid I'll start suggesting things & if they like them, great! But if not, like you said I'll probobly just pick a colour or range of colours and let them choose the style they want. I'm glad people are saying similar tea length on bridesmaid dresses would be ok though, we're having an outdoor wedding so I don't want them wearing anything too long that might end up getting a bit dirty on the bottom from the grass. 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Oh my god you're the first person I've seen since obsessively stalking this sub since I got engaged that's having a vegan wedding! We are too - how's yours going? When are you getting married? I'm having real trouble even getting my immediate family (parents and brother) on board, and I'm just worrying I'll be getting comments and complaints on the day. Do you have any advice?
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	That's awesome! Congratulations! :)  It really helps when your partner is on the same page as you for any major lifestyle choice, thankfully my FH (eeek can't get used to saying that!) is vegan, we have loads of vegan friends who will be part of our wedding party, and my future BIL is vegan too so if there are any comments on the day we'll have a lot of people around us that will have our backs.  Did you tell all your guests in advance that it's going to be vegan fare?  We're doing a free bar too so like you said - how can people complain when that's on offer?  Food wise - that all sounds amazing! <3 I absolutely love stuffed mushrooms. We were in the States just recently visiting FHs American family, and his Uncle showed me how to make pizza mushrooms - using a big portobello for a base, then pico inside it, then vegan cheese on top. We cooked them on the BBQ and IT WAS SO GOOD. We're based in the UK and having the wedding on my parents land (old barnhouse in the countryside) & I really want food trucks. I'm considering wood fired pizza (then guests could either try or hold the vegan cheese depending on their preference), maybe loaded fries (everyone likes fries), maaybe tacos (but I have some older family members who just won't eat spicy food so that's a worry). I'm thinking if the food trucks are adorable like out of old VW campervans or landrovers etc, that will get a lot of buy in before the guests even eat so I'm hoping that will help...!  That's awesome you work in a job that ties in so closely with your beliefs! What do you do if you don't mind me asking? PS sorry for the wall of text! I just need another bride to talk to about this haha!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Oooh I will do that! Thank you!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	How did you compliment your bridesmaid dresses with your wedding dress? | Hello Weddit!  I'm in really early stages of wedding planning (just got engaged, 2 and a bit years to go but I'm so excited already!), and I'm already getting bamboozled by the different styles of wedding dresses and bridesmaid dresses. I've already seen a style I love for a wedding dress, [this kind of tea length dress](http://www.truebride.co.uk/800/Brighton-Belle-Lottie) - but I don't know what would compliment it for the bridesmaids? So I'd love to see how you guys who are married figured out what would look good with yours!  :) Or, if anyone's just got any advice for what you think would go with this style, I'd love to hear it!
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	These look awesome! I'm late to the party here but did you decide to hire them? what's the company name? 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	That sounds ok. Were you watering them at the roots or was some water going on the stem/leaves? And what time of day were you watering them? If it was night time, that can cause issues too. I'm not sure about plant hormones, but I feed my tomatoes weekly either using tomato feed or organic seaweed growth enhancer and this years batch are looking really healthy! I've got some flower buds on them already, so it looks like I'll definitely get some sort of harvest from them! :) 
PM_ME_UR_NECTARINES	Are you pinching off the side shoots? That can encourage them to produce more fruit. Maybe too much watering was causing them to go mouldy? How often were you watering?

dappled-and-drowsy	I have to say most HR people I have worked with are actually on the light side.  Most times it's the managers who are looking to screw over someone.  For these types, it's usually for petty or personal reasons.  Things unrelated to actual work performance.  That's when it gets sticky because ultimately HR is there to advise, and these managers especially, don't want to hear any reasonable advice.
dappled-and-drowsy	That's mine too!
dappled-and-drowsy	I was 14 years old and have seen them countless times since then.  You don't really appreciate them till you see them live.  Luckily I got to experience that early in life :)
dappled-and-drowsy	As someone with 15 years in HR, it's not just about protecting the company, although that is important, it's about having a good/positive work environment.  That includes making sure people are treating each other respectfully.  There are actually companies out there who value their employees and want to do what's right :)
dappled-and-drowsy	Yes and good lord I hated them!

dappled-and-drowsy	Thanks for enabling me :)
dappled-and-drowsy	Mine is a combo long distance/no future situation.  I'm trying to make myself believe that I can control my emotions and keep from getting hurt.  But yeah, I know this will only end badly.
mystriddlery	What is your gift that is also a curse? | 
mystriddlery	I remember that was one of the clues in National Treasure!
mystriddlery	If we were light enough they would just pick us up and drop us from 30 feet then eat us.
mystriddlery	>shes not going to invite him back  CNN already invited him back after this.
mystriddlery	You cant say boobs here its a curse word, please audibly spell it from now on.
mystriddlery	I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Grandmas are friends, not food.
mystriddlery	Do they have herby fully loaded potatoes?  
mystriddlery	Always wondered how he pushed out so many books over the years...His word per minute count mustve been off the hook.

mystriddlery	Yep, the lack of object permanence means you can scare babies with the same trick every time!  
mystriddlery	Thought I was on r/Bengals for a second!
mystriddlery	They are not, theyre the mini ones, but not cut at all. 
mystriddlery	Popcorn is pretty loud to be the standard movie watching food | Probably didn't matter with silent movies but still, it seems so weird all the food we choose to eat is pretty annoying (popcorn is crunchy, and the candy bags seem designed to cause a shitton of noise when you open them).  Probably a small thing to gripe about, anywho whats your favorite movie food (if any)?
mystriddlery	Damn, tastes good, and a great date snack to get that lady and the tramp kiss, two birds one stone.
mystriddlery	Seriously, you expect to raise a baby without it being scared *ever*? Its not even possible to shelter a child that much, and I doubt itd do any good longterm if you did.
mystriddlery	That would actually be pretty funny if some stalker left things like this.  Edit: It would be just like the movie Stranger than Fiction!
mystriddlery	True, he is way more articulate than the Geogre character would lead you to think, I think they do the "...and George" because he was last on the list, it just sounds right to put an 'and' before the last thing in a list.  
mystriddlery	Names Buddy the Elf, can I take your order?
mystriddlery	I know, I'm fawned of it as well.  
mystriddlery	Somebody call an ambulance, this mans drowning!
mystriddlery	Plus, the only reason it cost these students more is because it took them a long time to finish.  The article *included* cost of living to their tuition total.  Since a lot of people work while going to community college, and it can take more than just the two years that you expect (which may add to their cost of living expenses), but the cost of CC is ridiculously little compared to a full university.  In terms of cost per class, its at least 150% less where im at to go to community (CC 5 credits = $500, University 5 credits = $1500).  Plus at university you pay for so many things ypu dont want, forced meal plans, having to live in the dorm room the first year etc.  
mystriddlery	You can disagree with a system and still understand how it works.  He also never even defended the pricing, he's just correctly pointing out that, Apples knows people will buy this, the people at *Apple* could think this is stupid, but if they did a survey that shows people will cough up 1000 dollars to have a new phone, they'd be stupid not to do it.  
mystriddlery	What makes you think your neighbors are illegals?  Serious question.  Plus, if I were a landlord and had someone with a 50% chance of paying me and another option with a 100% chance of paying me, as landlord, cant I make that choice myself if they're legal?
mystriddlery	Kleinfelter' Syndrome and XX men are *incredibly* unlikely, and dont even make up a large proportion of the trans community.  I dont get what they have to do with this argument, but guys with Kleinfelter syndrome are still guys, that happen to be born with a mutation, how do you not grasp that?  You're acting like these people are in the millions when they are are *very* small minority of people with a medical condition that classifies them as a 'mutant' or outlier compared to everyone else. 
mystriddlery	This thing is SICK!  So we're going to postpone it a little while.  
mystriddlery	Its tough working in hollywood when everyone knows you're a serial killer!  ...its also the episode where he was thought to be a serial killer, for anyone who missed the refrence
mystriddlery	You expect to print a car, and think itll be cheap.  Do you know how much cars cost now?  
mystriddlery	Hes saying theres xx and xy, but when something falls out of those two its considered a mutant by scientific definition.  
mystriddlery	If I was having sex with someone I thought was female and found a micropenis instead of a clit with no warning id be pretty angry and confused.
mystriddlery	Ive posted to this sub like twice, so im going to ask you to prove that, but I do think its funny simply asking for a source horrifies you, its very telling of you, and this subs mentality.  Edit:  Also, you can see in my post history this guy is making up these claims, is the rest of this sub scared of the truth or is it just u/ocelotking?  People this stupid just looks bad for this community you guys have, do you really want to be known as the group who disregards anyone who questions you?  Sounds pretty tyrannical (which I thought was against this subs belief system).   
mystriddlery	Could you link some stats of illegal alien voter fruad?  Edit: Ill take the downvotes as a 'no' apparently nobody on this sub has a source
mystriddlery	At a certain point its just safer to take off and get a new job if theyre going to fire you for evacuating.  You cant expect people who make 8/hr and treated like shit by customers and (likely) management to put that job over their own lives and their families.  If I was told to evacuate, Im evacuating, tough shit if someone still wants a pizza.  
mystriddlery	Washington, wasnt working, after a while I switched my wifi source a couple times it finally started loading.
mystriddlery	How do you teach kids and not know "innocent until proven guilty".  Wtf is going on in this country.
mystriddlery	I wonder what her ratemyteacher reviews are like.
mystriddlery	I do find this funny, but dont politicians never use their social media, isnt this likely a intern fuck up or something?  Also who goes on twitter for porn?
mystriddlery	The real uplifting news would be that police cant sieze your money like that anymore.
mystriddlery	Unless you like fleshed out, relatable characters on your show.  Any examples of a time flanderization *was* better than before they changed?
mystriddlery	+9%
mystriddlery	Doesnt take much to get you to quit, does it?  It kinda looks like you just gave up because you had nothing to counter with. 
mystriddlery	So the audiance sould get kind of a dickbutt view.
mystriddlery	Maybe hes just thinking of those kinky Ikea commercials?
mystriddlery	I love that moment where reading turns into a full on brain movie.  
mystriddlery	The exit.  Source: Work at Ikea
mystriddlery	It would be really cool if we just taught everyone sign language in grade school, it seems like it would add a lot of utility and be a fun way to communicate | [removed]
mystriddlery	You dead serious about that?
mystriddlery	In low capacity places, urinals are convenient, but if you're at a sporting event or pub/busy restaurant, you can tell how much time the urinals are saving.    Edit: they also have urinals for women it turns out, Im a guy, but does anybody have any experience with those and why they arent more common?  Ive never heard of them till looking it up just now, but if theyre as effective as guys urinals it would probably make a big difference.
mystriddlery	Its actually our new rorschach test we use, its less intimidating for our patients.  Ok so u/Assclown_wrangler, please describe the faces you see and we will tell you everything your answers reveal.
mystriddlery	Watch out, its a North Korean bar now.
mystriddlery	Yep, urinals cut time down a shitton.  
mystriddlery	And yours is so great you can tell what u/zouppp is like based on one sentence?  Doubt it.  Theres literally nothing to cringe about in this video, she went on the show to do a interview, he asked some questions, maybe to an American they sound 'accusatory' but they really are harmless questions, and she is a pretty bad interviewee to be honest, unless this show does no show prep or discuss talking points beforehand (which, like almost any talk show does) she wasnt adding anything the audiance liked and the interviewer tried to bring more out of her. 
mystriddlery	Its been 9 minutes, OPs dead, someone hurry over there before the nilla waffers get stale!
mystriddlery	I love the fact you keep acting like your opinion actually means something, or you have some definitive say in things, go back to playing hearthstone if youre too sensitive for tv interviews.  
mystriddlery	Seein those two puppers without collars on makes me kinda sad :P A flood has got to be crazy for animals too.
mystriddlery	In all seriousness, can someone explain the symbolism or meaning behind this art piece?  I get the vibe its about immigration, but I dont know what its *trying* to tell me, if you catch my drift.  
mystriddlery	Literally 12 hours ago, this thing had like over ten thousand upvotes, how do people think stuff this blatant will get upvoted? 
mystriddlery	Who did you end up mating with?
mystriddlery	Do you use that to shoot the weed into your body, is this what happens after your body gets used to weed injections and you need to step it up just to feel something?
mystriddlery	> Is it bad to think we are taking massive steps back recently?   >Listen, I never said we're taking massive steps back. 
mystriddlery	Regardless of how good it is, it *is* an outlier in that sub, the whole reason it was upvoted so much was because redditors havent heard it before (even though its not the best joke ever) the fact remains that 90% of that sub is reposts, the stuff that hits the frontpage has a higher chance of being OC sp if you only browse jokes you see in r/all theyre bound to be pretty good, but if you actually look through that sub on rising or new its a cesspool of reposts.  
mystriddlery	Well technically a repost is stealing, and they get the most clicks on that whole sub. 
mystriddlery	IIRC Walgreens used these whiskey perscriptions to launch themselves as a leading pharmacy. 
mystriddlery	Pretty sure this was McDonalds ad campaign for that JT movie Out of Time. 
mystriddlery	Yes! Everyone in my family has switched to team Jamie, but I'll never forget [this scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t4cBybquQTg).   
mystriddlery	I thought the conservatives and the alt-right were stereotypically thought of as the people who fucked their cousins, keep on projecting your fantasies on other people, you aint fooling me you racist bitch.  As an American, I can tell you *you* are not one of us.  You will die with your agenda unfufilled, your lifes wishlist will be left with no checks as you die, and once youre gone no one will remember you were even here, I just wish that after you were dead you could see hpw much happier the world would be once youre gone, but since the afterlife doesnt exist youre just stuck being hated on Earth until you die.  But no matter what, whenever you think yourself a proud American I want you to know deep down, *you are not one of us*
mystriddlery	Relavent username?
mystriddlery	Just so everyone else knows this (because I did not) but you can go in to be with your pet while they are euthanized.  It makes it way less scary for them, and comforts them as they pass.  As someone whos had to put down two of my goldies, I really wish I knew this the first time, when the second had to be put down a few years later, our new vet asked if we wanted to be in the room, and we got to hold our dog as she passed, as devastating as it was, the good it does for your dog is worth it.  
mystriddlery	As someone with a family highly inflicted with scoliosis, this looks kinda like a picture from an old family reunion.
mystriddlery	I just had to google like ive never done before, but I think I found something possibly related.  I searched through North Korean headlines and translated some of the articles, and tried to message my NK cell on the darknet, and if my North Korean is right, I have substantial evidence that could definitively prove that the *bird* is indeed the word.  
mystriddlery	>massive steps back  Can I ask what those steps were? 
mystriddlery	Mutually assured destruction
mystriddlery	*During the cremation*  "goddamnit whos microwaving fish at work again!?"
mystriddlery	And all my favorite futurama episodes
mystriddlery	its on hulu now
mystriddlery	Get one of every color and play VW pool.
mystriddlery	What was your best 'delayed gratification' experiences? | 
mystriddlery	Grinds it for half a second  Kief chamber explodes
mystriddlery	Kinda high thought, but do you guys ever feel like youre playing god or oversteping your place when you kill a bunch of ants? (Or any non human animal) When I saw this picture my first thought was "I know what fire ants are like, fuck em" And a few weeks ago I saw a bunch of ants in the bathroom and nust squached the hell out of them.  But when I went to clean up the dead ants I saw like 30% were still alive but their bodies completly broken, wriggling in pain and I felt a huge pang of guilt (never felt bad killing ants or other bugs before) and ever since Ive been cautious about how I exterminate these things, any of you guys feel like that, or am I just overthinking minute things that really dont have an impact?
mystriddlery	Is the drink blue or is it just the cup?
mystriddlery	Websters dictionaries definition of contentment: that goats face.  
mystriddlery	Damn, well at least if you survive it serves as a great lesson for the future!
mystriddlery	I think youre thinking of the hunt for red october
mystriddlery	If youre a student at any college they give you a pretty sick discount though!
mystriddlery	I cant believe the circlejerk about that episode, not even the cringiest moment of the series and people skip over an awesome episode because "they cant handle it".  
mystriddlery	So, did they mix some flavors and one is just heavier than the other, or was something not stirred properly?  
mystriddlery	Car mechanics, what made you say "how are you still alive"? | 
mystriddlery	I dont get why this is so downvoted?  Everyone knew OP tried to make it this way, you just pointed out some helpful hints as to what *could* go wrong with it, and provided anecdotal evidence *and* still complimented their work, reddits a fickle bitch sometimes.
mystriddlery	Walter White Walker Texas Rangers?
mystriddlery	Thats what the fly lobby *wants* you to think. 
mystriddlery	Its basically the club version of "you miss 100% of the shots you dont take" he is saying if you *arent* a wuss you try to make moves (not my opinion, but its the gist of the comment)  Nobody has a 100% success rate with these moves, so if someone isnt interested it isnt a huge deal, you just keep trying to find someone to click with.  If you dont try meeting *anybody* you might never find yourself on r/cringe, but at the same time, you arent going to meet anybody.  I for one dont like to meet new people at clubs, but I can still understand this mindset.  
mystriddlery	Your friend looks like a giant walking through a forest.  
mystriddlery	So glad someone got it! 
mystriddlery	Jason Bourne is probably thinking "god damn I cant even go shopping without having to kill somebody"
mystriddlery	I saw some video (posted here on reddit but I cant find it right now) where a guys house was so fucked up, just covered with cockroaches that the local officials literally burned the place down.
mystriddlery	So this is the beginning, this is how we get those moving newspapers and paintings like in Harry Potter.
mystriddlery	This show has the unique ability to take a character youve never seen before and making you feel for them, which is why a lot of the biggest 'kills' for me arent really listed.  That scene where Jamie was trapped with the Starks and another prisoner tells him he used to be his squire, that scene made me distrusting of Jamie to this day.  Plus also when the hound basically killed that father/daughter duo just trying to survive.    I think it would be cool to compile who killed the modt innocent people (including extras) to see whos the most evil.
mystriddlery	Even the box is frowning.

martinshiver	Anti-Vaxxers are people who are scared. They don't necessarily refuse to believe in science. They want someone/something to blame for a condition we do not yet understand. Its not only autism that is in question here, its that they simply do not want a chemical cocktail (which they don't fully understand) injected into their offspring. They are simply afraid.  They are also selfish from the standpoint that they are only looking to "save" their offspring in the short term and do not want to think about long term population effects (i.e. herd immunity).

martinshiver	Coca Cola (or was it Pepsi) TV commercial from the 90s where they go from room to room in a club, the music melody and general beat is the same, but the style of the music changes from room to room (i.e.: techno -> trance -> metal-ish -> breaks, etc) After all the searching, at this point i'm not even entirely sure that the commercial was real..

martinshiver	Thanks! :) It is my track.

mcmanchild	>CHRISTOPHER MCCURDY: None of them died. And we never saw any seizure, we never saw any side effect essentially.  in mice. Its been heavily documented (albeit anecdotal) that certain people are prone to seizures if they take high doses of kratom.    
mcmanchild	Same here. I think its due to the small stimulating effect it has. 
mcmanchild	I believe this happens due to breathing slowing and then eventually stopping, causing the capillaries in the lungs to burst.   not by directly inhaling kratom powder etc
mcmanchild	pm'd you. nothing malicious going on, I've just been swamped here. 
mcmanchild	PM'd
mcmanchild	oops sorry, should have listed them again.   Green Thai MD, Super Green Borneo are both from KratomVirtue and the Green Malay is from Green Harmony (its only an ounce, but I figured I'd throw it in anyways). 
mcmanchild	the whole top row (white vein,gold bali,gmd,ghk,red vein)
mcmanchild	$50 shipped or best offer! *
mcmanchild	[SELLING] 900+ grams mixed strains | SOLD
mcmanchild	$7.50 for what? A small priority mail box? This is all going to have to go in at least a medium. 
mcmanchild	PM me about that.
mcmanchild	in what way? the KratomVirture strains alone are $30 total lol
mcmanchild	Yes, pm if interested. 
mcmanchild	only two bags are yours lol
mcmanchild	hmm, that shouldn't really cause any problems. I bet its just because it was too taxing on your liver and you happened to have the test around the same time. 
mcmanchild	how much alcohol do you usually consume per month? also, sometimes peoples livers can't process that many outside adulterants at once. I try to only do kratom when I do kratom.
mcmanchild	570
mcmanchild	Yep, no worries - done!
mcmanchild	Oh, didn't realize that. Apologies if this post goes against anything. I'm just super psyched to not be smoking haha  I'll delete the super edit, is there anything else I should remove? I only added the part about me selling soon as I wasn't sure what to label where the kratom was from. 
mcmanchild	smoked for five years in my teens, developed a panic disorder along with a few other problems which forced me to stop smoking it. Kratom has completely replaced any sort of THC for me.   I may give it a go again if it becomes legal here. 
mcmanchild	those are most likely your best bet (GH,BH and KC). for quality and pricing. 
mcmanchild	I'm not sure to be honest. I think you can email him and ask:  ryanpratama@greenharmonyid.com  couldn't see why not. 
mcmanchild	100% Green Harmony. Hes an extremely down to earth vendor. Quick to ship and always online it seems lol
mcmanchild	http://steamcharts.com/app/447820 (DoI)   http://steamcharts.com/app/2630 (CoD 2)  where were you getting your stats? 
mcmanchild	this is why I say to stick to the originals. A lot of scammers in indonesia (a lot of good ones, with bad quality too). Its too much of a risk. 
mcmanchild	Red Orchestra 2 is still played a lot + the new Red Orchestra Vietnam that just came out (I know not WW2, but still in the same genre kind of).   maybe not a pool, but theres options out there.
mcmanchild	I just blended Kratom Virtue Red Bali with tan's goldmd and KV gold elephant, fantastically relaxing. 
mcmanchild	 it just seems that they are jumping into a pool full of already decent and readily available WW2 MFPS. Its going to be interesting to see if they can keep up. thats all. 
mcmanchild	Yes, but this game seems to be taking forever to come out, meanwhile DOI has been out and has a consistent player base with a ton of updates. I'd like to see how they'll be able to keep up with that and the new COD WW2.
mcmanchild	"Day of Infamy" pretty much took their shine. 
mcmanchild	I have this exact problem with certain strains. My chest will become very tight\anxious and I'll start to get racing thoughts and heart beat. I now tend to only stick with reds and golds and haven't had many problems since.   some greens seem to work well, while others can send me straight into panic. 
mcmanchild	good to know. however, never ship before you receive payment.   especially with such a high amount. 
mcmanchild	Agreed. I used to be a gaia fan boy, but somewhere along the way things just started to not work as well. Bought the same strains from different vendors and everything was back to normal. 
mcmanchild	really? I'm more of a red\gold guitar player. Maybe a mix of a nice green MD and gold bali to really get focused. 
mcmanchild	look alright to me, what'd you expect lol
mcmanchild	227
mcmanchild	Ah, this was the long post you were talking about! stay well! and happy bday again!
mcmanchild	the classic non-shill-shill
mcmanchild	awesome! never too late to change, hope you continue to feel better. 
mcmanchild	https://teanstuff.com/ usually has good quality and fast shipping. (seems hes out of stock)   /u/Cb_187 is also very good as far as both. 
mcmanchild	have you tried any golds for anxiety? Try out their bali gold or /u/tanwelton has gold maeng da which works extremely well for my anxiety.   I've suffered from severe panic\anxiety for the past six years so I know which strains really can kick it off, and both of these work great for me. 
mcmanchild	they ranged between 5-10g per day, more towards 5g. 
mcmanchild	liver levels after one year of semi daily kratom use | I recently got out of a three day hospital stay due to some mental health issues I was having. They did a full, and by full I mean a huge two page blood work up on me. Everything, to my surprise (recovering alcoholic), is in perfect and normal ranges.   readings are as follows if anyone is curious:   Bilirubin, Total: 0.5mg mg/dL -- Normal range between (0.0 and 1.2)     ALT (SGPT) 12 IU/L -- Normal range between (0 and 41)     AST (SGOT) 14 IU/L -- Normal range between (0 and 40)   I still suggest everyone here get a full blood work up if you're ever curious if you've done damage. 
mcmanchild	two times a day keeps the wobbles away! 
mcmanchild	theres been a few posts with people who have had really adverse reactions to taking kratom (sky rocketed liver levels etc). 
mcmanchild	do you drink enough water? 
mcmanchild	PM me, lets work something out.

mcmanchild	how bad is Citalopram (Celexa) for your heart? | I recently restarted taking this due to depression and anxiety issues, and while it does seem to help, I've read all over google that it has an FDA warning for potentially causing an electrical problem in your heart. any of you guys have any information on this? I'm taking 20mg currently.   I'm also an avid kratom user, which has also shown to do something similar to the heart. So i've become a bit paranoid. 
mcmanchild	A+ guy!
mcmanchild	moving is such a pain! best wishes! 
mcmanchild	Its not only exclusive to I.V. use. Theres something called "Monkey Water" which is where people take a small amount of tar heroin, put it into a spoon with water, heat it up so it dissolves then take a needless syringe and squirt it up their nose.   either way I would try to talk to him, see whats going on.

mcmanchild	whatever floats your boat. Maybe a tolerance break would help? 
mcmanchild	Kratom Ultra - Less is More! (yes, another one of these posts) | so lately I was getting bad anxiety with kratom, chest pain, weird bodily sensations.. just a general sense of dysphoria with each dose I took.   Today I made the decision to take 1.25 grams instead of my usual 2.5 grams, thinking whatever I'll waste a dose if it doesn't work. It works just as good and I have had all those nasty symptoms cut in half!   for all the noobies out there, please please PLEASE experiment with dosage. Even a half gram either way can change the experience completely. 
mcmanchild	Yep, without a doubt. give your receptors a little time to reset and rest and you should be back to or close to your original tolerance.   the longer the break, the better. 
mcmanchild	do a one week break. Its going to be a pain, but well worth it. 
mcmanchild	http://www.chopra.com/articles/what-is-ashwagandha  http://get-a-wingman.com/ashwagandha-benefits-for-men/
mcmanchild	I wonder if this is the same for me. I get more of a physical anxiety reaction to kratom when it goes bad (palpitations,chest pressure,sweating and dizziness\vertigo). I'll have to try this with my next dose. 
mcmanchild	those cups look like guacamole lol 
mcmanchild	I've had people PM me before asking if I was a shill, but in all honesty some of the best kratom going right now is from /u/tanwelton  the gold maeng da is out of this world good (reminds me of the premium maeng da from herbalrva except more euphoria)  gaia bali gold is another classic that stays in my rotation. 
mcmanchild	No lol I would go out to a bar or friends house, get drunk, then call them for rides home as I didn't want to endanger anyone or get a DUI.   I've walked home drunk many a time, never that much of a risk taker. 
mcmanchild	p a g l i a c c i       
mcmanchild	so very thankful for kratom and this community. | recently I relapsed hard on alcohol after going almost 6 months with minimal drinking. I don't want to make a long sappy post, but I just wanted to thank you guys for being here and thank kratom for essentially helping me quit drinking. I was destroying my life with it and couldn't function without it.   the difference my family and friends see is night and day. no more drunken arguments, no more having to pick me up from places because I was too blacked out to drive.   I woke up this morning and took my dose and went for a 2 mile walk, just taking everything in, being so grateful to not be hungover or in jail. I would have been too hungover a year ago to even have the thought to do that.   I'll end my rant here, thanks everyone!   
mcmanchild	I had this happen to me recently, while I was shirtless on a really humid day. It was one of the most disgusting feelings I've ever experienced. 
mcmanchild	carne asada sounds so good right now.
mcmanchild	USPS is notorious for having a sketchy tracking system, however that does seem a bit weird. it will generally always update once its been picked up or dropped off at a post office. 
mcmanchild	I wouldn't take more. IME I start to get negative side effects if I take two teaspoons or more.   it might just be a strain issue, some strains do absolutely nothing for me. 
mcmanchild	I wish I wasn't working so much lately, I would definitely take you up on this! 
mcmanchild	boys brain is growing as we speak, the skin peeling back not being able to keep up. 
mcmanchild	very cool, dude!   could be the next "thing" lol
mcmanchild	Haha, thought you were trolling me for a second! IT will come shipped in that box though if your wondering.

mcmanchild	I've had weeks where I had to stop taking kratom because all it did was give me anxiety attacks. Lately I've been handling it a bit better, but I don't think its the cure-all that everyone makes it out to be.

mcmanchild	No alcohol whatsoever. Not even the little tease drinks every other month. I know I can't handle it now.

I would like it to be $100 even so if possible lender would pay the paypal fees and I'll pay them back on the return.    thanks again!    EDIT: I CAN RETURN PAYPAL FEES + $10 INTEREST. 
mcmanchild	I had my first real relapse last night | it was terrible. The usual scenario, got too confident at a birthday party and thought I could handle one mixed drink. That turned into drinking two natty daddys, then getting a bottle of wine (that I took from my mom, she had been in the hospital recently and it made me feel ten times worse doing it) and finishing it off with some whiskey. I woke up crying today. the one thing I'll never miss about drinking is the faces of disappointment and sadness from once again taking it too far.  I feel like such a piece of shit, I was doing so good. I had a few "relapses" where I was able to drink 1-2 drinks and be fine, but I knew it would just end up leading into something like this. 162 days down the drown, much like the rest of this liqour.   stay strong guys, and thanks for being here! 
mcmanchild	ya fixed it :P
mcmanchild	Yeah, no doubt. I'm glad it works for you! It helps my scoliosis pain a decent amount as well, so it kinda sucks when I get anxiety attacks on it. 
mcmanchild	> Ashwagandha  such a good supplement to have around. I wake up feeling so refreshed and generally more content. 
mcmanchild	thank you. its much appreciated.

jlfranklin	23 [M4F] Denver Netflix, Cuddling, Geeking Out! | Good evening everyone! Writer, and aspiring literary agent here! I'm new to Colorado and I'm often quite lonely--and boy do I have an adventure to tell you! I'd love to cuddle and watch Netflix or just chat about life in general. Human contact helps this ambivert center his gravity and learn about the people around him. People are amazing and beautiful! I'm a HUGE nerd and don't mind binging Doctor Who or Young Justice. I'm versatile as a cuddler and don't mind being the big or little spoon! If I catch your interest, message me with your favourite binge-worthy show in the subject line! 
jlfranklin	*You are now me*
jlfranklin	The epicness is too much! Fantastic job! 
jlfranklin	Can we trust 'im to crown the right person?
jlfranklin	He failed his city.
jlfranklin	Two Steps From Hell - Archangel (Archangel) | 
jlfranklin	Certainly! Glad I could be of help!
jlfranklin	Terribly sorry for my late response and what not; writing and all that business, wot, wot! Anywho! My writing has been quite fantastic, doncha know?   Now, I haven't **completed** anything in terms of my novel, or the current universe (well, I have some chapters already written!).   It definitely takes discipline, you know? I would suggest using the Android app Write-O-Meter. Its an excellent tool in keeping track of what you're writing, and how much time you spend each day writing. At the end of each session, you win "guava" which can be used in turn to reward yourself (eat a cookie, watch an episode of Castle, whatever strikes your fancy!  As for tips, I'd say write the story that you've always wanted to read, that no one has bothered to write for you. Writing what YOU want to read is what get's you excited and passionate about telling your story. It makes the process a lot more fun!   I'd also suggest setting time aside every day to write a minimum of 250 words. Even if you don't feel inspired to write, keep your booty in the chair until your 250 words are completed!   Well, that's all my advice for now! 
jlfranklin	Well, seeing as I don't even like Marvel (yeah, I said it. Don't tell me I'm wrong, you might trigger me.), I don't really care. But I guarantee you, the same people who don't like this, are the same people who are gonna line up to go see it.  EDIT: I misspelled guarantee.
jlfranklin	[WP][TT] Everything between you and your darling fiance is magnificent! You could never be a happier person! You have only one problem; its not a big problem at all. Its just that your parents don't know you're engaged to a vampire. | 
jlfranklin	You my friend, get a gold star! Excellent! Excellent!
jlfranklin	[WP][TT] Life as an "adult" isn't as exciting as you thought. Your cthulu landlord is unusually nice, you get sneaked into elven raves by your demon co-worker, and your kitsune roommate is a social justice blogger. Yup. Not exciting at all. | 
jlfranklin	[IP] Being a skip-tracer is risky business, but it normally doesn't involve tracking down unkillable women. Then again, $25,000 is a lot of money... |   https://40.media.tumblr.com/f4c89f4d82bf54db3373a8e8a9e779ed/tumblr_npr2uqtiHO1tsltx2o1_1280.jpg
jlfranklin	Thank you! I'm gonna need it! 
jlfranklin	Ohhhhh! Okay! Got it! Should I remove the planned out script then? 
jlfranklin	TIA gonna put my booty in a chair, and start writing the novel I've been trying to write since I was 13! (I'm 21 now!) | I love telling stories! I've been writing ever since I could, but *really* got into the swing of things after reading Eragon! When I found that Paolini had started writing Eragon at sixteen I thought to myself, "Hey! I can do that too! I can *totally* do that!" So I buckled down and attempted to write my first novel! Granted, it was a blatant rip off of Eragon, Redwall, the Chronicles of Narnia, Sonic the Hedgehog and Naruto, but it was my baby! It was really proud of it......but halfway through it I got lazy. I stop writing. Then another idea came to me! So I started writing that. Then  I got lazy. I stopped writing. Then another idea came to me. So  I started.....well, you get the picture! Anywho, recently I've been stewing over all of my story ideas, and wondering how I can put them all together. Now that I've merged all of my universes, I've got a story I can run with that I'm really excited about! Today is the day that I start writing that story! I look forward to this upcoming adventure! 
jlfranklin	You Read YA, or nah? | Growing up an avid reader (and I still am one to this very day!) I read A LOT Of YA! Like, that was all I would read! Every chance I got to go the bookstore or library, I'd grab what was hot at the time! I LOVED reading stories about people my age, doin' bad-ass things! Anywho! As I got older, and I started venturing out into adult novels (I only hang out in sci-fi and fantasy section....urban fantasy is really at the forefront right now!), I tried going back and reading some YA novels.....and....I just can't....I can't do it! I mean, I'll gladly read the novels I fell in love with, but *now*, when I try reading YA, I'm like [I'm all like...](http://41.media.tumblr.com/26d5a38a45faefb6aa6c948b9e45e24a/tumblr_n889tjnN9b1smvx6to1_500.png). Maybe its because I don't wanna read about punk-ass, angsty "woe is me! no one understands because I'm seventeen" teenagers. I don't know. I just can't do it! Ugh! I don't like YA anymore! So, I'm wondering, who else reads YA? If so, why? If not, why not?
jlfranklin	I'd say:  1.) [Artemis Fowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Fowl_%28series%29)  2.) [Percy Jackson and the Olympians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians)  3.) [The 39 Clues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Clues)  4.) [Alex Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rider)  5.) [The Power of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Five)
jlfranklin	*blush* Th-thank you!
jlfranklin	[*sigh*](http://s1186.photobucket.com/user/joyalm/media/BOUT/Forums/picard_doublefacepalm.gif.html)
jlfranklin	Now *THAT* sounds like a delicious book to read! I love peculiar happenings (hence my passion for urban fantasy!), so I think I might pick it up, just to have a looksie! 
jlfranklin	Now, I WILL say that I've been reading Artemis Fowl, and I find them quite delicious! I think this is becuae Artemis Fowl is quite a mature read for its intended audience. I feel like Artemis acts more mature than most teens in YA. Percy Jackson is one of those series that I grew to love growing up, along the Raven's Gate, Alex Rider, and The 39 Clues (and Spielberg is supposed to be writing directing a 39 Clues movie!). So maybe it would depend on the subject matter? I think if I read "slice of life", I'd rather read about adults, or families as opposed to focusing everything on teenagers.
jlfranklin	Hahahah! No, no don't worry about it! Someone else did the same thing! I think they were trolling though...........
jlfranklin	Whoa! Harlequin??? At 14 and 15! Wow.   Thou was no doubt a--how shall I say?-- quote-unquote; advanced youth. Good heavens...Harlequin at 14......
jlfranklin	I'm familiar with the Fear Street novels nad from what I've heard it sounds a bit dark for YA. Granted, YA can be pretty dark! But Fear Street sounds like it ventures into the "adult" category! 
jlfranklin	*giggles* Oi, did you read the original prompt, or just the heading? 
jlfranklin	Hehehe! That my new found friend is tokusatsu (imagine it grown ups ran around in candy colored spandex and armor, fighting rubber monsters with plastic weapons.....on motorcycles...with sparks and explosions!)  Well, I can already tell by tour choice of words that you're quite handy with a pen! You're probably a better writer than I am. Anywho! That sounds quite amazing! I've never been that great about writing drama; I'm more of an action writer; I love sci-fi and fantasy; and I've been on this urban fantasy kick for a good while!   Ahhh! I have that exact same problem! To tell you the truth I've been trying to write my WIP ever since I as 13. It kept changing and I kept switching stories; so I've decided to merge all of my stories together into one big tale!  Aye! Having a passion about something. Something that you care deeply about is really fun, and quite amazing! You meet the most amazing of people and learn beautiful things! People with a passion have the most fun!  Ohhhh! You mean like AKB48 and the like! I've never really been into j-idols (at least the ones you speak of!), but now I'll be checking this out! More things to add to my list of awesome awesomeness!  I'll need to watch that! I've watched a lot of Korean and Japanese drama; my brother and mother really like Chinese drama; so they probably know what this is! I'll have to check this out!  Aye! 'Tis most wonderful to meet you as well! 
jlfranklin	Exactly. I don't mind romance; but I really don't care about teeny bopper drama...I'm sorry,....I can't get into it....
jlfranklin	Aye, that might have something to do with it for me. Since I'm not a teenage anymore, I don't feel like their stories resonate with me the same way it did as I was growing up! I still feel like some of these teens are a buncha punk-ass whiners who try to talk all deep and philosophical.......
jlfranklin	You mean like Divergent???
jlfranklin	Hahaha! Okay, I'm not sure why, but when I saw "Banana in the house!" My mind immediately went to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZd8Ra3tyFM). Hehehe!  Anywho! Oh really! Now I'm curious (despite the fact that writing is now a thing of the past!), what did you used to write? Do you think you might start back up again?  Hey, hey, hey! Otakus ruuuuule! We are perhaps one of the most fantastic and amazing creatures on the planet (but that's just my opinion.........). Wait...J-idols....you mean like Mika Orihara, Yuko Ogura, and Rina Akiyama? A handful of idols appear in tokusatsu (like the one above!)...besides...I've.....I've read through some of the idol books..........  Anywho! Otaku! Are you watching any anime or reading any manga? What about Asian drama?   Fellow writer/otaku/all around fantastic human! 'Tis a pleasure to make thine acquaintance! 
jlfranklin	Nope, I haven't; but that's because I'm a biblosexual. I only get turned on by books.  *But all silliness aside, nah, not yet! I'm kinda old-fashioned on certain things and would like to wait until I'm married....but that's just me.....*
jlfranklin	Zack Hemsey I"ll have to take a listen to some more of his music! The soundtrack to Inception was indeed fantastic! 
jlfranklin	Does anyone else listen to trailer music? | I remember back when I was in college, I was *supposed* to be getting ready for an exam. Being the very studious student that I was I ended watching Kamen Rider Wizard during most of my study time! When I *finally* buckled down and started studying I thought "Maybe I should turn on some music." On a whim I pulled up YouTube and decided to listen to some "contemporary classical". Some how, I stumbled across epic orchestral, and heard [my very first trailer music track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhU4RFTmok). I immediately fell in love and started downloading as much of the music as possible!   Anywho! Enough backstory! How many other folks listen to trailer music (Two Steps from Hell, audiomachine, ICON Trailer Music, Ivan Torrent) What are some of your favorite tracks?
jlfranklin	Sweet! Thank you! Thank you! Heck, here's *my* [playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/12140733234/playlist/0UelM6e5RUqhWSBdwd5nLx)
jlfranklin	YESSSSSS! Feckin' love me some Bergerssen and Phoenix! What happens to be your favorite album?
jlfranklin	Aha! That's from their "Invincible" album! That has some REALLY good work out/sparring tracks!
jlfranklin	[WP]Karis hated the name “Night Lady” Partially because it wasn’t very creative. Mostly because it gave nightmares to the very children she protected. | 
jlfranklin	Awwww! Kittens are fantastic creatures! Thou art quite lucky! Anywho, [Happy Cake Day!](http://i.imgur.com/M12S3A3.jpg)
jlfranklin	C.S. Lewis caught a lotta heat from Christians who hated TCoN. He told them "Well, I didn't write it for you!" That shut things down quickly! <3 
jlfranklin	Mhm. I know the feeling.  "Oh! Magic! That's evil!" or "What....there's a *dragon*...are you crazy?!" or what I've heard the most "Well, there wasn't enough of 'the Gospel' in the story." Yeah. Its hard. Hence, I don't deliberately say "I'm writin' a Christian story! Nope! I just sit down and write a damn good story!
jlfranklin	Ah! So would you say its Christian fantasy? As  Christian, and a writer m'self I'd love to read it whenever its finished. I'm hard pressed to find any good Christian fiction >.<
jlfranklin	*tilts my head to the side* Inspirational Fantasy? Whatever do you mean? 
jlfranklin	Aye! I know the feeling! I'm still trying to build the world of my current work! I hate loosing my flow of writing when I get stuck with something that doesn't work in the story-verse! 
jlfranklin	Keep up the good work! How far have you gotten into it?
jlfranklin	Aye! Sci-fi FTW! What kind of sci-fi do you write?
jlfranklin	David Guetta - The World is Mine [Dance] (Official Video) | 
jlfranklin	So, how many of my Sisters and Brothers of the Ink and Pen are in attendance? | I'm a storyteller! A teller of tales, weaver of yarns! I've a few stories I've been tryin' to tell since I was 13 years old (I'm 21 now!), but I can't tell 'em all, so I'm just cramming them into one big story (thus making them alternate universes). Anywho! Enough about me and my writing! What about you, fellow writers? What are you writing? What story are you trying to tell?
jlfranklin	Wow! This is so very awesome, bro! I'm happy for you! I've always said that I'd feel way more comfortable dating a good gal friend, you know? You don't have to worry about the "getting to know you" process; you both already know what you like and love! It clicks so well!   
jlfranklin	See, normally that kinda stuff would make me roll my eyes! I'm like "Dear God, take me now......." But when its well written, and the characters have depth it can be the cutest, most beautiful thing on the face of the earth!   *My Korean drama habit has a lot to do with this....* 
jlfranklin	Oh! Kinda like Two Steps from Hell, audiomachine, Immediate, the Hit House etc. How long have you been writing?
jlfranklin	Oi! Writing music is definitley a form of storytelling! Check out this song and you'll see what I mean:   [Ivan Torrent - Remember Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR3E9VzPDnU)  Now you've got me curious! What kind of music do you write?
jlfranklin	Oh that's just too awesome! This is why I want to hurry up and get what I'm writing finished. I don't wanna turn on the TV one day, and see my, "This Christmas..a story that sounds something like /u/jlfranklin from Reddit wrote when he as only 13 years old...an epic tale of love, loss, and donuts!" 
jlfranklin	Oh! Okay this is easy! Soooo, I think I have a few crushes! But as of right now, the gal that stands out to me the most is [IU](http://wallpoper.com/images/00/41/81/02/iu-singer_00418102.jpg). I've been watching her drama *You're the Best Lee Sunsin!*, and she is sooo adorable! <3 
jlfranklin	Dualistic - Ecstatic by Limitless Recordings | 
jlfranklin	Living in a post-apocalyptic world actually sounds kinda....kinda cool!  Oh! You know that reminds me of John Joseph Adam's "The Apocalypse Triptych"!  Its an anthology of short stories that are set *before* the apocalypse (The End is Nigh), *during* the apocalypse (The End is Now) and *after* the apocalypse (The End Has Come).  
jlfranklin	Most writers think their writing is dreadful. I know I think mine is; no matter what people say. I sometimes feel like my non-writer friends are either naive, or just nice and don't want to crush my feelings. >.< Maybe I'm too hard on myself????
jlfranklin	Oh! That's awesome! Each story now has a different "flavor"!  Hahaha! Aye, I agree! Especially in paranormal romance! My dream PR would be:  1.) Clumsy human male lead (a black guy like me!)  2.) Cool-as-the-other-side-of-the-pillow badass non-huamn female lead  3.) Female lead pursues male lead  Like you said, the "bad boy" thing is getting really, really old....oi.....
jlfranklin	Oh gosh I know the feeling! I remember in elementary school, every week would get a list of vocabulary words and would have to write a story based on those words. I LOVED doing that, and still do! My stories became quite popular with my classmates, because they would end up characters in the tale. I got a kick out of their reactions!  I'll never stop writing! 
jlfranklin	I've always wanted to ask a romance writer this (now I have the chance! Yay!) How do you keep from writing the same story over and over. I mean, I know everyone's love tale is different, but how do you keep each romantic tale fresh, without doing the same thing you did in the previous story? I can only see myself writing maybe just one love story......Also! What romantic trope are you tired of seeing all the damn time?
jlfranklin	Ahhh! Me too! I've always loved cute, adorable and playful girls! <3 
jlfranklin	Oi, sorry for your loss bro. Perhaps revenge is a dish best served over ice...
jlfranklin	Cosmic Gate with Alexander Popov & Jannika - Shine Forever | 
jlfranklin	I see where you are coming from. People with different interests "tag" themselves to "fit in" with a group of folks with similar interests. Very good observation! 
jlfranklin	Aye! Same here!
jlfranklin	Nerdy women. All the way! Oh! I also think creative writing is sexy.....mmmm......Glasses are sexy too! And gals in graphic t-shirts. <3 
jlfranklin	I would totally be one of those guys with "Free Hugs" posters! Aye, you're right. We can't judge people! Still, the word "otaku" has so much weight to it that I personally wouldn't call *myself* an otaku (just like the n-word. It has so much weight to it that I don't call myself an n-word). I don't mind if my friends call themselves otaku. I'm cool with it. <3 
jlfranklin	This looks like it be *excellent* over at /u/nosleep! I imagine David Cummings, "I'll be reading to you a story, about what happened to /u/FranklinFox, when he texted a girl he "Only Met Once" *NoSleep theme song*

jlfranklin	Well, I'd love to *not* be single! But....its just not in the cards right now. There aren't a whole lot of places for me to meet singles (and Dear, Lord, if I can find a nerdy single girl, I'd *totally* ask her out!). However, there have only been a total of four potential partner in crimes:  1.) I didn't ask her out because she had a boyfriend  2.) I didn't ask her out because she was too young (I was 17, going on 18 and she was 14. She was a college classmate)  3.) I didn't ask her out because she was a co-worker (surprisingly, she wasn't a nerd, like I am. I'm totally willing to date non-nerdy gals, as long as they're cool with my nerdiness, and childlike sense of wonder! But nerd gals get ultra-priority.)  4.) I *did* ask her out (well, we actually asked each other out...it was odd), but she disappeared on me for about two months.  So I'm single because I haven't met anyone really!
jlfranklin	21/M/USA - J-nerd and Creative Writer Here! I'm Lookin' For Awesome Email, and G-chat Friends! | Hey there everyone! I'm here, and here to make awesome friends! So a little bit about me, I'm from the the US of A! That's all I can really say for now.....anywho! I'm a writer, and aspiring novelist! I love writing stories; and I hope to *one* day write and direct animated films (or open up a book cafe in the UK, or a manga cafe in Japan; one of the two!)  I'm a *huge* nerd too! I love sci-fi and fantasy books and movies, I'm a DC fan (gotta love me some  Green Lantern!) and can't get enough of martial arts movies! But out of all of my nerdy endeavours, I'm most definitely at J-nerd! I LOVE anime, Tohou, Vocaloid, and tokusatsu (which is my all time favorite!) I'm not as into J-dramas as I am into K-drama, but maybe you can make some suggestions! I'd love to hear what you enjoy!   Music! Gosh! I love ALL kinds of music, but lately I've been listening to a lot of trance and trailer music!    Okay, okay! So back to the beginning! I'm a bit of a J-nerd, and a creative writer! I'm looking for awesome email and G-Chat friends from wherever in the world you may be! Let's be good friends, mmkay? I look forward to hearing from you! <3

I dream of one day writing and directing animated film and television. To be honest, I'm a bit of a nerd--glasses and everything! I love Doctor Who, Final Fantasy, the DC Universe, books, martial arts, Korean drama-- you name it! However, but my area of expertise is that of an j-nerd (or, otaku). Yes, I know the answer to life is 42, BUT! I always find myself drifting aimlessly to the manga section every time I step into a Barnes and Noble! I end up staying up way too late watching anime! I'm love learning, being an avid reader and I have a honed taste for tea, being an abusive tea-drinker. My iPod is a smorgasboard! All kinds of music fit my tastes. Anything from melodic metal, to orchestral music, to uplifting trancer and the occasional radio drama. Upbeat, quite carefree and of a laid-back disposition, I have an odd sense of humor, and a tendency to pepper my everyday language with character voices, and British slang and spellings.  I'm ready to have a beautiful relationship with an awesome woman! The Batgirl to my Robin! The Mikasa to my Eren! The Richard Castle to my Kate Beckett! A perfect match for me should be an all-around bundle of beautiful amazement! She should be passionate about who she is and her interests, and not really care about what other people think about her! My darling should challenge my thinking, as I challenge her's so that the both of us can grow together (because iron sharpens iron!). A perfect match should be willing to pursue me; in fact, it would be amazing for us to pursue each other! If I got a box of chocolate on Valentine's Day (or just because!), it would really make me melt. I'd like to know that I'm loved, and the world to know, that my darling loves me! Kiss me in public! Grab my hand! Do everything "the perfect boyfriend" would do to his girlfriend. I find that really endearing and attractive! Another very important thing in a match is a love for me for who I am in all my weirdness, my quirks, and my childlike sense of wonder! I'd want her to love life, and not be afraid of anything (well, except maybe spiders--dreadful beasts they are), willing and ready to try new things! Eclectic tastes in food and music, and a passion for life! She can "protect" me when I get way too scared after watching horror movies or reading those disturbing Creepypasta. We can hold hands, dressed like a steampunk couple as we shop for groceries! I'd love to share a cozy night, watching Arrow, or Black Rock Shooter! Perhaps crafting stories together (ah, my greatest dream is for my lovely dear to be the artist for my graphic novel I'm writing!), reading "Jason Todd and the Outlaws" to each other at Barnes and Noble, and perhaps even cosplaying together at our local convention (Harley Quinn and Nightwing; Peter Pan and Tinker Bell; Cloud and Tifa...hmmmm.. perhaps even crossplay? A Master Chief and Cortana crossplay sounds delightful! Overall, my darling should be a huge nerd, and love life and all things about life. She should love me for who I am in all my weirdness, and I'll love her for who she is in all her weirdness.  Your photo will get my photo! Don't forget to add "Twizzlers" in the subject line so that I know you actually read through my post! Well, I believe that is all for now!

jlfranklin	She's being colorist. I'm a black man with brown skin. I'm triggered.
jlfranklin	Yup! Menism is supposed to be satire.
jlfranklin	Two Steps From Hell - Stormkeeper (Battlecry 2015) | 
jlfranklin	This is true. But they aren't married. They aren't husband and wife. They are boyfriend and girlfriend. Hence they should treat their relationship that way. This tends to be a problem I've noticed in some churches. We teach our members to treat their dating relationship like a mini-marriage. It doesn't work like that.
jlfranklin	*reads in reverse* "back me message please". Hehehe! Sorry, I couldn't help it. But good heavens. "I know a lot about bestiality"...yeah see I don't see how that works in his favor..... 
jlfranklin	Yup! Superman with Chuck Taylors and a sweat suit! I'm ready to roll!
jlfranklin	Oh gosh, just imagine....everything they break.....they get broken too.
jlfranklin	In reality, if humans suddenly received superpowers, wouldn't certain powers come at a "price"? | If a human were to become a superhuman, wouldn't the use of their superpowers have some sort of negative affect on the body? Since humans are born "normal", wouldn't the sudden change in their make-up have some sort of side-affect whenever they used their powers?  * Speedsters require massive amounts of water to keep their bodies from overheating  * Heat vision causes temporary blindness  * Telepaths/psychics are prone to migraine headaches  * Shape-shifters can't stay in the form they are born with for long periods of time  * Supers who fly are prone to vertigo  The list can go on, but I think you get the picture.   
jlfranklin	Or perhaps while their muscles are strong, their bones would be weak? 
jlfranklin	Yes. Depression. Nightmares. The whole nine yards. If you really think about it, superpowers might not be as fantastic as we think they are.
jlfranklin	Nope! This is pre-Die Antwoord!
jlfranklin	Yahoo, hidee-ho yup I'm coming around the stretch So here Fido boy, fetch, boy, fetch I got the rope-a-dope a slippery choker, look at me get raw And I'm the hickory-dickory top of morning boogoloo big jaw With the yippedy zippedy Winnie the Pooh bad boy blue Yo crazy got the gusto, what up, I swing that too
jlfranklin	I just realized how lovely this is last night! I had the most darling darling wrapped in my arms.....and then I woke up and realized it was my body pillow.....  *Still..., I think I prefer to be the "little spoon".*
jlfranklin	The plate of nachos has to come from *somewhere*. And just think about the amount of concentration it would take to summon a plate of nachos!
jlfranklin	Well...I can't wear tights...........
jlfranklin	Oh gosh...I remember those. Ugh..........I think as Christians, we tend to artistically isolate ourselves. This is why  our entertainment sucks in general. We try to be "safe".   *“Safe?” said Mr. Beaver; “don’t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? ‘Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good.*
jlfranklin	I agree, its too expensive to live in the city; hence me not living there. Aye, me too; Cumberbatch is a favorite actor of mine!  Oh, I'll stay safe! As long as I sneer like a scary black man, people would think twice about trying to hurt me.   *grins wickedly*
jlfranklin	If ignorance is bliss and knowledge is power, how do you know when its time to be stupid? | 
jlfranklin	Batman needs a Robin! (as long as I don't have to wear the little green panties, I'm good!)
jlfranklin	Am I The Only Nocturnal Being Here?? | I could probably be Batman; I have a hard time sleeping most nights......and the thing is....I LOVE it! Its like when the house is all quite and I lay me down to sleep, and pray the Lord my soul to keep, I get all happy and excited! I can't close my eyes and end up staying up really late. Later than I should I might add, being that my new job requires me to be up early in the morning.  Being up at night I get an adrenaline rush and start watching anime or writing or reading or snacking or doing something to keep myself occupied in the hours of darkness!  But I like it! I like being up at night in the dark. If I lived in Vegas I'd probably be out on the town most nights, just walking around (unless I could find like an all night bookstore) or watching movies. Something to keep the nocturne in me awake!  Are there any other nocturnal creatures who enjoy the hours of darkness? Anyone else enjoy getting......nosleep??
jlfranklin	Coming from a Christian black guy who finds beautiful women in all ethnic groups I'm gonna have to say, nah. Interracial dating and marriage is not a sin. In fact, its perfectly fine in God's eyes. Take a look at Ruth and Boaz. Ruth was a Moabaite. Boaz was in Israelite. They got married. God didn't have a problem with it. Why? Because he was the foundation of their relationship. That's what it really all boils down to. You should ask your your mom to back up what she believes with Scripture! See what she says.

wwethrowaway3	[Serious] How do you build Confidence? | 
wwethrowaway3	But wouldnt that mean Naito gets a short reign as IWGP Heavy Weight Champion? I really want Kenny Omega to win the IWGP Heavy Weight Championship but I also want Naito to have a decent run with the title.
wwethrowaway3	I got Pokemon Sun last time so I am leaning on getting Pokemon Ultra Moon this time. Seeing as the games might not be too different from Sun and Moon, it seems almost all the stuff I would want from Ultra Sun would already be provided in Pokemon Sun so getting Pokemon Ultra Moon will help me get the rest of the goodies. But need to find out more before I make my final decision.
wwethrowaway3	Where's Kalisto?
wwethrowaway3	Awesome! Can't wait to see a Naito inspired Incineroar!
wwethrowaway3	Sweet, keep me posted! Maybe Naito?
wwethrowaway3	I was wondering, which wrestler would you have as Incineroar? I know Incineroar was inspired by Tiger Mask/Black Tiger but I was wondering which WWe superstar would Incineroar fit?
wwethrowaway3	I really hope they bring new Johto Alolan forms to tie in with the Gold and Silver VC release!
wwethrowaway3	Does this new information increase the possibility of there being new Alolan forms for USUM?
wwethrowaway3	Anyone have a list of all the returning rangers?
wwethrowaway3	So what can we expect from this?
wwethrowaway3	There is also a Alfonso Cuaron one!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_hpJHNt4IE  
wwethrowaway3	What do you think about changing your last name in order to increase your chances in Hollywood? | So I was reading an article about how Chloe Bennet changed her  Chinese last name in order to increase her chances in Hollywood since Hollywood would not cast her while she had her Chinese last name intact. It got me thinking how Oscar Issac also changed his last name from Hernandez to avoid being typecast.  So I was wondering what are your guys take and opinion on all this? Would a actor increase their chances in Hollywood if they did not have a last name that did not sound universal? How do you guys feel about actors who change their last name because they would not find success under their other last name?  Here is the article: http://people.com/celebrity/chloe-bennet-changed-chinese-last-name-slams-hollywood-racism/
wwethrowaway3	I really hope this doesn't make WWE think that there is no money in a Finn and Gallows/Anderson  reunion. There is money to be made in that group.
wwethrowaway3	Who were the three-four guys Dave was referring to?
wwethrowaway3	Just wondering, is there any celebrities who made it through hard work instead of money and connections?
wwethrowaway3	I am in the same boat, for Sun and Moon I decided to just use generation 7 Pokemon and Alolan forms and I ended up using most of the Pokemon I liked which means I also can't use 10 Pokemon (as I also don't want to use a Pokemon twice, not counting starters).   I really hope we get new Alolan forms so that way I can use new Pokemon in my walkthrough and it wont feel too similar to SM. But if it ends up being no new Alolan forms then I guess my team will be Incineroar (I already used him but he is my favorite Pokemon so I will make an exception), Dusk Form Lycanroc, Alolan Marowak and Drampa. Alolan Marowak and Drampa were two Pokemon I never used so it will be fun to use them. I do not know which other two Pokemon I will use so I really hope there will be new Alolan forms so I can use them to fill up the slots or so that they can replace some of the Pokemon I have already chosen for my planned team(If there are multiple new cool Alolan forms). If worst comes to shove then I will just use Pokemon from past generations to fill up the two slots, preferably Pokemon I have not used yet.
wwethrowaway3	He already has a son, his name is Gohan. In all seriousness though, Piccolo has been for Gohan more than Goku has his whole life. I really like how Dragon Ball Super focuses on the relationship between Gohan and Piccolo!
wwethrowaway3	This picture kinda inspires and makes me feel if I put the work in I can accomplish anything in life.
wwethrowaway3	I dont see Tyranitar at all. Were the players only allowed to use pokemon from the Alolan pokedex?
wwethrowaway3	Hey Robert! I just wanted to say I am an actor and you have been an inspiration of mine!   You have chosen some fascinating projects to be apart of over the years. What are some the things you look for when choosing your next project?
wwethrowaway3	Men of reddit when is the best time to contact/text someone when you get their phone number? | 
wwethrowaway3	Hope Gladion gets a substantial role in USUM!
wwethrowaway3	I wonder who would they have to be the villain for a Nova film?
wwethrowaway3	If you go to 3:21 in the trailer then you will see pictures of old villainous teams. Maybe we can take pictures with villainous team logos?
wwethrowaway3	Can someone help show me how the white light resembles Deoxys? I am not seeing it.
wwethrowaway3	I know Daniel Bryan says he feels he wasted the prime years of his career but AJ Styles is 40 and is still in his prime. Plus Daniel Bryan had time to heal old wounds, spend time with his wife and daughter. I think Daniel Bryan has a lot in the tank left and cant wait to see him in the ring again! Has he mentioned if he started training for a comeback yet?
wwethrowaway3	are the buildings that replaced the construction sites similar?
wwethrowaway3	In your personal opinion do you guys think there will be new Alola forms in USUM?
wwethrowaway3	is there a program exercise routine you could recommend? Or a great site to look for a online program?
wwethrowaway3	Posture help | Hey guys, I was wondering if I could get some help regarding my posture? I currently have terrible posture with always hunching (something similar to this https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-06/4/14/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-8989-1401905428-10.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto).  I was wondering if there are any exercise techniques that could help me get rid of it? Or any classes you guys would recommend?  Thanks!
wwethrowaway3	Is there a program anyone can recommend me that would make me gain muscle in the entire body and a six pack? I have been going to the gym but I would like to stick to a program.
wwethrowaway3	What are the chances of having Jerry Stiller on Kevin can Wait?
wwethrowaway3	Really hope this Game Informer visits Game Freak articles ends with USUM news.
wwethrowaway3	Does Tetsuya Naito incorporate Mexican themes in his character? | So I watched the G1 Climax Finals yesterday and it made me a huge fan of Naito! I thought it was interesting how the stable he leads is called "Los Ingobernables de Japon" and his signature move is called "El Destino" which is destiny in spanish. I read that he went to Mexico to train and develop his character so it lead me thinking what Mexican themes does Naito incorporate in his character?
wwethrowaway3	I heard Quentin Tarantino wanted Adam Sandler for the role of "The Bear Jew".  I wonder how Adam Sandler would have portrayed the character.
wwethrowaway3	Late to the party but I wanted to say that I stayed up late to watch it and ended but sleeping before the main event. However, I watched the main event match in the morning and I just wanted to say WOW! What a great main event match! It made me a fan of Naito and I loved the number of Destinos he put on Kenny to finally win the match!
wwethrowaway3	Really feel that WWE is throwing away money not fully capitalizing on Andrade "Cien" Almas.
wwethrowaway3	whoops, I meant Pacific time. Thanks!
wwethrowaway3	What time will the Okada vs Omega match start?
wwethrowaway3	I hope he gets drafted to Smackdown if the "superstar shakeup rumors" come true.
wwethrowaway3	Me right now:  http://s1.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unhappy-young-cena-fans-gifs-of-wrestling-fans-being-wrestling-fans.gif
wwethrowaway3	Ok, Number 17 is easily becoming my favorite character from this arc so far, hoping he is one of the last ones in Universe 7 to be taken out.
wwethrowaway3	i have never heard any rumors of Roman being a cheater. Do you have evidence to back it up?
wwethrowaway3	I have never heard of the Emma one. Does anyone have any context or links on Emma being in the ho bag?
wwethrowaway3	I think its obvious we will get a Dawn form as well, the Dusk form looks too similar to midday form for it to be considered the third form of the Lycanroc if it doesn't have as much similarities to midnight form as it has to midday form.
wwethrowaway3	Is Naito the one most likely one chosen to win the G1 Climax? I thought there were rumors of Omega winning the IWGP Heavyweight championship at Wrestle Kingdom 12?
wwethrowaway3	how do you know which clothes fit you properly?
wwethrowaway3	Thanks man!
wwethrowaway3	oh, I work in the bay area. I do have actors access but it was not something asked by the agency. I do not think my agency has a file on my resume, since I recently filled the resume on the profile but I do not know if I did a good job.
wwethrowaway3	Communicating with my Talent Agency? | So I got signed by a talent agency a couple of weeks ago, I got my headshots and they have already chosen which headshots will be the ones they submit me for casting projects. I haven't been sent out yet to any auditions however, so I was wondering what is the next step? Would it be inappropriate for me to email my talent agency to know what would increase my chances to be sent out for auditions? or ask if I have already prepared everything from my end? Such like prepared a professional resume among other things?   Essentially what I am trying to say is how do I communicate with my talent agency and when is it appropriate to email them and ask what type of questions would be appropriate to ask?  Thanks!
wwethrowaway3	I'm sorry but if Jeremy Irons doesn't play Scar in Jon Favreau's live action Lion King film then it would be absolute criminal.
wwethrowaway3	It wasn't WWE's fault for his run being a disaster, Mistico a.k.a original Sin Cara just didn't want to put the effort. He was given a a lot of hype when he debuted, but Mistico just didn't try. He didn't want to learn English when it was necessary so he can communicate with the other wrestlers, he didn't want to adapt to the WWE style when it was necessarily as other wrestlers in the WWE do not work the lucha style. I heard there were even reports of Mistico being Triple H's pet project and Triple H letting Mistico know if he had any problems to just go to him and he would help him. When you have the backing of one of the most influential people backstage and you still fuck up then it shows how lazy you are. Mistico was at fault here and nobody else was.  -------------Edit-----------------------  Here is the article where it says that Triple H took Mistico under his wing.  http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/237185-report-more-details-on-sin-cara-triple-hs-relationship
wwethrowaway3	I thought this film was fantastic! It took my breath away and had me at the edge of my seat during the entire film. Really love the ticking soundtrack and thought it was cool when they were at the train the ticking stops after we see Tommy sleeping. Showing that the terror was over for them.  One question though, how was George rendered blind? was the blow Cillian Murphy hit him so severe that it blinded him?
wwethrowaway3	Man I am loving the spotlight Number 17 and 18 are getting! Really hope Number 17 doesn't get eliminated next episode judging by the preview.
wwethrowaway3	I was wondering, could it be possible the praetorian guards have replaced the knights of ren? you would think if the knights of ren would be in the film then there would be heavy promotion as well as toys but instead we are getting a lot of promotion for praetorian guards. Even in the posters that making star wars talked about had the praetorian guards front and center.
wwethrowaway3	I cant find Almas,Roode or Itami. Maybe it is not the entire roster?
wwethrowaway3	Hey Val Kilmer! I am a huge fan of yours! my question is "Which director would you like to work with in the future?"
wwethrowaway3	so is the current rumor that the elite praetorian guards will replace the knights of ren in the film?
wwethrowaway3	This might get buried in the thread but how do you defeat loneliness? How do you become social and have friends or gain social skills?
wwethrowaway3	 /u/salmonsole you da real mvp!  
wwethrowaway3	GIVE ME INFINITY WAR FOOTAGE FEIGE!!!!!!!.....༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つplease༼ つ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ
wwethrowaway3	[Serious] What evidence is there that ghosts exist? | 
wwethrowaway3	I think AJ Styles vs Randy Orton for the WWE championship would make it more interesting for Summerslam. I also think Jinder mahal going after the United States championship would help strengthen his character, maybe Jinder says that if he wins the United States Championship he will change it to the India championship?
wwethrowaway3	Do you have a link to the Lapsed Fan podcast on Chris Benoit? I would like to hear it.
wwethrowaway3	Thanks man!
wwethrowaway3	Cool! So I guess the dark knight version of Aquaman is a female version and the dark knight version of Wonder Woman is a male version?
wwethrowaway3	So which Dark knight is suppose to resemble which dc character?
wwethrowaway3	So in the manga Trunks doesn't get to beat Zamasu like in the anime. Dont know how I feel about the ending, I liked the anime ending better because Trunks gets to beat Zamasu after all the character development he gets and someone other than Goku gets to beat the bad guy. I also liked how there were more characters for Trunks's farewell that created some great moments like future trunks meeting goten and gohan's farewell to future trunks. I did like the explanation for a couple of things such like why Future Trunks would not stay with them. Overall there were some things I think the manga did better than the anime and there were some things the anime did better than the manga for the Goku Black arc. I'm just happy that the anime and manga are different and are both its own thing.
wwethrowaway3	The United States championship is more prestigious than the WWE Championship.....and they said 2016 was crazy.
wwethrowaway3	Does anyone know the story of what happened between Alex Riley and John Cena? I tried looking it online but couldn't find it.
wwethrowaway3	It has to be Incineroar for me! Me an him have gone to many adventures and defeated a lot of trainers on the rating battles. Cant wait to continue my journey with him for USUM!
wwethrowaway3	Have the other Dark Knights look been revealed yet?
wwethrowaway3	Yo mamma is so stupid she loves you.
wwethrowaway3	Wait so is it confirmed Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman did a double turn?
wwethrowaway3	if the Sun/Moon Ash is a different Ash from the XY and Z Ash then could the Sun and Moon Ash be the same one from the 20th Anniversary movie?
wwethrowaway3	I can see this happening,  especially with the Pokemon not being popular just like the original they chose to get Alolan forms. My question is which pokemon that is cool is most likely to get an Alolan form? Like Niitetales which was cool in the beginning but also got an alolan form.
wwethrowaway3	Like others from this thread; my favorite Pokemon is Incineroar! I remember when I used to play I would always want the shiny version instead. But when I saw Incineroar that was the first time I didn't care for the shiny and instead kept the normal one. There is something about him that makes him a badass and the red and black color fits him well. It seems like the type of pokemon that would be used for badasses like Red Hood, Punisher, Boba Fett or even wrestlers like Seth Rollins, Finn Balor, Black Tiger and Kenny Omega. In the end there is something about Incineroar that makes me like him more than the others. I chose Litten for Pokemon Sun and there is no doubt in my mind that I will choose Litten as my starter for Pokemon Ultra Moon!
wwethrowaway3	Does Scizor have a chance to become a alolan form based on this theory?
wwethrowaway3	I wonder which wrestlers Okada interacted with when he went to Raw backstage?
wwethrowaway3	cool star wars list! Was just curious, what is your reason to pair up Toxicroak with Boba Fett?
wwethrowaway3	I think Seth Rollins could be an opponent for Wrestlemania. Considering the rumor that WWE2K18 will be Kurt angle coming back against the main antagonist of the story which is Seth Rollins. 
wwethrowaway3	So happy Kenny Omega won! Hopefully he wins the IWGP World Heavy Weight Championship next!
wwethrowaway3	Yes Kenny Omega won!
wwethrowaway3	From watching this match, Cody has improved from his days in WWE.
wwethrowaway3	Why do I feel Cody will sabotage Omega and enter in the finals on the Bullet Club's behalf?
wwethrowaway3	First time watching NJPW and I have to say wow! The Kenny Omega match and the Okada v Cody match were amazing! Goes to show you that there are other options other than WWE.
wwethrowaway3	Knee Strike City!
wwethrowaway3	How do we know Goku and Gohan will be the superstars of this arc? (Not that I am complaining, it is about time Gohan gets his time to shine!)
wwethrowaway3	Hope he gets another run with the WWE championship
wwethrowaway3	What Pokemon do you think your favorite characters from other media would have? | So I was having some fun and thinking what Pokemon my favorite characters (Boba Fett and Red Hood) would have and I was wondering what Pokemon do you think your favorite characters from other media would have?
wwethrowaway3	I'll Start, I think the Red Hood would definitely have Incineroar as his signature pokemon while I have no idea what Boba Fett would have. Any thoughts?
wwethrowaway3	Who are the top 5 stars from the new era in the WWE? | So after watching the WWE2K18 trailer, I was inspired by the "be like no one" campaign by Seth Rollins where the future is now and there are some new top faces in the WWE. So similar to the vein of the Attitude era where The Rock,Steve Austin, Triple H, Mick Foley and The Undertaker were the top stars, "Who do you think is/will be the top 5 stars(main guys) of the new era?"
wwethrowaway3	Dude! I remember being there and the entire crowd was booing the hell out of Roman! it was by far the largest reaction of the night. Only one small section near me was cheering for Roman. But when Seth Rollins cashed in, it didn't matter if you were cheering for Roman or Brock because Everyone started cheering the hell out of Seth!
wwethrowaway3	When did the reality era begin and when did it end? Also who were the 5 top stars of the reality era? like the top 5 stars of the attitude era were The Rock,Steve Austin, Triple H, Mick Foley and The Undertaker.
wwethrowaway3	I just found out Andrade Cien Almas won the CMLL universal championship in 2011! Hope that guy becomes a main eventer in the WWE someday.
wwethrowaway3	I think it will be influenced by Hush. In the comic book, the arc featured with a wide variety of villains and it had a detective-noir feel to it. Also if they decide to do a Red Hood film then a Hush style film would be the perfect place to include him! Since we all know that the Red Hood is Jason Todd, in a Red Hood film we can go in from the beginning with the knowledge of Bruce Wayne already knowing Jason Todd is alive and is the Red Hood. While the hush film can end with the reveal that it was Jason Todd who was behind whatever villain's plan the writers come up in the film.
wwethrowaway3	Which characters are most likely to stay post Infinity war? | 
wwethrowaway3	Posture class? | Hey guys, So I recently have had neck pains as well have been told that I have bad posture. I was wondering would a pilates class help fix that? or would another type of class help with that?
wwethrowaway3	I was in attendance for Seth Rollins first WWE World heavyweight championship win. I know how it feels man, makes you feel more connected to the wrestler in that you were there for their big moment.
WeenDaddy	What is the most undervalued invention? | 
WeenDaddy	CFM players, who are your favorite players to switch positions with? | I personally like moving Braxton Miller to QB
WeenDaddy	Thank god someone else agrees with me. People think that Dalton is some scrub ass QB, but they forget that he has been close to elite in recent years. Dalton hasn't regressed in my opinion. I think he's gonna prove people wrong yet again.
WeenDaddy	How many yards did he get?
WeenDaddy	No. I don't think you realize how awful Zampese is.
WeenDaddy	Granted he was playing with one arm. Hopkins pushed off on every freaking curl route too
WeenDaddy	Ken Zampese needs to get canned. I still have faith in Andy, and I think his struggles are because of that jackass coaching the offense.
WeenDaddy	Pat Sims looked like a fucking whale chasing down Watson lmao
WeenDaddy	At least Bullock is 3 for 3. That's one positive.
WeenDaddy	Our defense has looked pretty damn good this year so far
WeenDaddy	FUCK YOU COLLINSWORTH
WeenDaddy	Eifert exists!!
WeenDaddy	Marvin probably doesn't even know where he's at right now
WeenDaddy	Not Pacman :(
WeenDaddy	So Hopkins was pushing off on Dennard, but Dennard gets called for PI. Okay.
WeenDaddy	He was down!
WeenDaddy	Someone just yelled "fuck"
WeenDaddy	Sit down Bodine
WeenDaddy	Well, this game is ogre
WeenDaddy	Why would he fair catch that?!
WeenDaddy	What could Dalton have done to make our offense better?
WeenDaddy	Jeremy didn't fumble in the red zone though
WeenDaddy	Come the fuck on
WeenDaddy	Holy shit!
WeenDaddy	Oh my god Andy..
WeenDaddy	Geno looking fine af
WeenDaddy	This made me laugh audibly
WeenDaddy	About damn time!!!
WeenDaddy	Let's just bring someone in from the crowd to call plays
WeenDaddy	Oh kill me
WeenDaddy	So, what's the over/under on the amount of touchdowns we'll have this season?
WeenDaddy	For fucking ever lol
WeenDaddy	Fighting for yards
WeenDaddy	Come on Gio
WeenDaddy	*sigh* Aight, I guess we'll take the win. 
WeenDaddy	I'd donate
WeenDaddy	Fuck, Mixon wasn't even 20 when he had his incident. He was frigging 18 years old 
WeenDaddy	WJ3 with a great gun
WeenDaddy	I wanted to punch him in his stupid face lol
WeenDaddy	I will literally blow my brains out if Michael Johnson still starts when he's healthy 
WeenDaddy	Pacman!
WeenDaddy	WE SCORED
WeenDaddy	What the fuck
WeenDaddy	If our offense was even average, we'd be a top 5 team this year. Our defense is baller af
WeenDaddy	Geno was in hot pursuit that play
WeenDaddy	It was still a nice jump by Darqueze
WeenDaddy	Erickson smooth af
WeenDaddy	They were not white, unfortunately 
WeenDaddy	Jesus people. I think you're all forgetting that Dalton is a 7 year veteran, and was almost MVP just 2 years ago. Kizer has played one fucking game. Just shit the fuck up and support your QB. I know he's not doing good at all this season, but it's not like he's put in a perfect situation
WeenDaddy	Take Pacman out. Jesus...
WeenDaddy	Come the fuck on Pacman
WeenDaddy	Please don't say that
WeenDaddy	Zampese isn't advanced enough for that
WeenDaddy	Nooooo
WeenDaddy	Alex is a cool dude
WeenDaddy	I don't know about that. I think he's too loyal to leave, no matter how bad we are
WeenDaddy	Hey at least Marvin grew some balls 
WeenDaddy	Marvin tosses the challenge flag
WeenDaddy	Is it really his fault though?
WeenDaddy	*crickets*
WeenDaddy	He still had a 70 yard game last week. Thats impressive given the circumstances 
WeenDaddy	I wish I was there..
WeenDaddy	AJ does pretty much
WeenDaddy	Nice tackle by Mixon!
WeenDaddy	Shitty offensive line, just as bad offensive coordinator 
WeenDaddy	Holy fuck
WeenDaddy	Chris Smith!!!!!!!
WeenDaddy	The Notre Dame dude?
WeenDaddy	Apparently Hopkins isn't playing
WeenDaddy	Damnnnn
WeenDaddy	Fuck 
WeenDaddy	Adam looking like a grandfather out there
WeenDaddy	He's still better than Kizer
WeenDaddy	Lmao who said that?
WeenDaddy	Jesus dude, you're underrating Dalton extremely. He's been a solid starter for the last 7 years, and was in the running for MVP before he got hurt in 2015
WeenDaddy	PPR, pick one  Tarik Cohen, Sammy Watkins, Corey Davis, Zay Jones, Gio Bernard, T.Y. Hilton, Legarrette Blount
WeenDaddy	Just walk it off!
WeenDaddy	Kinda looks like Danny McBride, but idk
WeenDaddy	I know this doesn't mean everything, but...  [according to last game](https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/6zayil/nice_game_fellas/?st=J7IBKJWN&sh=4f12071f) 
WeenDaddy	I can try. The guy that offered this doesn't send or accept many trades, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to
WeenDaddy	10 team PPR  Give: Giovani Bernard, Legarrette Blount   Get: Jay Ajayi
WeenDaddy	I can't believe that he's our second best lineman lmao
WeenDaddy	Last year was nothing compared to what this year is going to be. And it wasn't those two allowing all of the sacks you jackwagon. There were three other shitty linemen beside Whit and Zeitler 
WeenDaddy	Because Andy has been our QB for seven years, and he's proven that he's a quality player. Dalton had a bad performance, yes, but McCarron would've done just as bad.
WeenDaddy	He could've been sacked lots more yesterday. And do you not realize that Whitworth and Zeitler did good last year? Whitworth was the best left tackle in the league. Although he wanted a lot of money, it was worth it. We didn't use the money we saved from letting them walk by signing any new linemen. I understand if we let one of them walk, but we should've signed one of them at least
WeenDaddy	Do you see our line now without them? It's going to get Andy killed
WeenDaddy	Why tf did I decide to be a fan of this team
WeenDaddy	I've supported Dalton for the last 7 years, no matter how bad he's done.. and I'll continue to do that, because he's my quarterback. Let's just hope he gets his shit together
WeenDaddy	We bent. A lot. Somehow, we didn't break.
WeenDaddy	Same. I live in Iowa, so that's unlikely.
WeenDaddy	If there's anytime to fire coaches, it's after week two. We'll have an extended week to find options
WeenDaddy	Gio :3
WeenDaddy	Fuck
WeenDaddy	Fisher, you gangly uncoordinated bitch.
WeenDaddy	Damn our defense is looking fine af
WeenDaddy	Gio finally getting playing time
WeenDaddy	Holy shit Darqueze is looking really good
WeenDaddy	Can we pass on first down? Is it illegal for us to do that?
WeenDaddy	Geno!!!!
WeenDaddy	Pats I guess

I could be totally wrong, but I have quite a hunch. 
dwakefield1125	Hoping someone could tell me as many operas as they can where good vs. evil is the main plot | 
dwakefield1125	Also what operas have a theme of a person being taken over by an evil spirit?

dwakefield1125	I'm just transitioning out of teaching (band) into a new field of work. I've applied to over 300 jobs in the last couple of months with not much luck, and was hoping that someone hiring HR/recruiting/training positions in Austin might see this and give me a chance to discuss my qualifications | I was a head director in Upstate NY for 7 years, with total control of my program, and moved out here last year. I had bad a experience with respect to a lack of professionalism so I left the school district I moved out here for. Shortly after, I had a short stint in sales. Sadly, it was all cold calling and I worked remotely from home, so I didn't have a ton of opportunity for success.  I guess right now I feel like I'm out of options. I've applied to so many jobs, both on LinkedIn and Indeed for months now. I have a Masters in Liberal Studies (I know) and Bachelors in Music Education. 3.55 GPA for my Masters. 14th in my high school class. Drum Major/school president/sports captain in high school. Coached varsity football in NY. I really made a mark in NY and had a great deal of success.  I don't know, I guess I'm just coming here in case some hiring manager reads these, or someone else might have recommendations. I have not gotten to the waiting tables/fast food service level yet, but I'm close.  I know it's a long shot anyways, but if anyone can help that reads this, here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-wakefield-5307aa1a/  Please, if anyone has any advice, or knows of any kind of HR position available in Austin, please let me know. I can't thank you all enough.  -Dan

adudeatwork	Just married two of my good friends this weekend. No engagement rings and none of that expensive traditional marriage shit. Turns out no unexplicable hand of society or tradition struck me down before marrying them because they didn't bankrupt theirselves beforehand. 
adudeatwork	Does anyone else's DM charge micro-transactions? [OC] | 
adudeatwork	Tonight our DM unloaded his spicy new F2P content for our campaign.  For the small price of $2.99 you can change the dye color of your armor in your own imagination!   For $19.99 you can purchase in-game cosmetics which the DM imagines for you [There is an additional charge to come up with it yourself]  Also if  you suscribe now you can get your own specialized dice sets!  Needless to say we are all pretty stoked. The only thing that Isn't great is that we are currently stuck behind a paywall. Unfortunately we don't have $59.99 to unlock the next segment of the main storyline.   
adudeatwork	Oh my apologies, the cringe emote is actually $1.99 from the DM shop.

adudeatwork	Thoughts on a campaign in a world with no magic? | Hi all,   I'm working on a home brew campaign in a world I've been building over the past year or so. The thing is while "magic" is technically relevant in the world, it doesn't exist. I was hoping to get some  insight on what could be the pros or cons of this.  Have you ever run a campaign without magic? How did it go?  Do you think it would be boring or too limiting for players?  Edit: Thanks everyone for the awesome suggestions on ways to make this campaign work! I'm definitely looking to a few different formats now, namely, Cubicle7's Adventures in Middle Earth, Iron Heroes, Warhammer, and GERP. I'll also consult with the group I play with and see what they think will be most interesting for them. 
adudeatwork	I haven't really done much of anything other than D&D so it would be interesting to see how another system fits my world idea.
adudeatwork	It definitely would be hard to make short, as I've been building the world for a while now lol. While monsters won't exactly exist in the world, there will be plenty of (hopefully) interesting npcs and other monster-like (but not actually monster) threats for players to deal with. So i'm hoping the story and intrigue makes up for some character choice restriction.
adudeatwork	Oh wow, I actually haven't looked into Iron Heroes. This actually might exactly what I need.
adudeatwork	Yeah that is a good point. I do suppose it's pretty straight forward. My story will just have to be grabbing to counter-act the lack there-of of magic. 
adudeatwork	Interesting. I've never heard of GURPS. I will definitely look into it. Thanks for the suggestion!
adudeatwork	Not having one. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Vegetarians and vegans, what is your opinion of eating artificially grown (lab grown) meat? | 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Trump supporters have real jobs, and can't travel like unemployed libtards looking for handouts. - some Trump supporter somewhere.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	"Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation." - MLK |

CardioSurgeonWannabe	DO NO HARM - Exposing the Hippocratic Hoax | 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	"I don't think your fat ass should be eating that hamburger due to my vegan beliefs, so I can't serve you that." Imagine the uproar 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	How much does that cost?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Have been published a lot, so I can say my writing style is road tested.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	The format of my last paper:  1. Introduction 2. Prevention 3. Screening (subsection: guidelines, reimbursement) 4. Diagnosis (subsection: physical examination, laboratory studies, imaging studies) 5. Surveillance 6. Management (subsection: medical, osteopathic manipulative medicine) 7. Referral  8. Special considerations 9. Summary 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I'd like to personally extend a "fuck you" to that person. Driving nearly 30 over and clearly has no remorse about it. Puts everyone's lives at risk. Kind of the opposite of being a future physician.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	While a valid reason, not a reason I share.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	AND MY AXE
CardioSurgeonWannabe	You didn't cure Alzheimer's in medical school? You aren't going to match.   Or my personal favorite: I have a 4.0 and 40 MCAT, why aren't schools lining up to perform fellatio on me?......maybe because you are a dick?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I like to shoot, would that be appropriate?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Or that trump voters seem to be the only ones driving into crowds...  But I treat that as an individual and not blame the group.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Ay thata be racists code 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I could see a B-rated scifi movie where they have to get to space, but the current space craft have been destroyed then after a period of panic, one character says something along the lines of "i know of one" [cue michael bay music] next scene shows helicopters flying to a distant military base, next scene shows opening of large hangar door, next scene shows buran from below to emphasize importance.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	"I think" 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	You: Any prescription drugs? No. Attending: Any prescription drugs? Yes, Lipitor, norco, toprol-xl, and fortamet
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Everybody lies.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	This. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Let me put it this way, anyone can be nominated for a nobel prize, I don't think it will hurt, but I don't think it will overtly help either.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	You are very welcome!
CardioSurgeonWannabe	My relationship: distance, distance, together, slight distance, more distance, maybe together? It has been great, we are both in medical school. Be honest with each other and state your wants/needs. That is all.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	This is true, really the end goal is boards and that should be my focus 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	One of the things that helped me learn everything, the knowledge part I've been talking about, is that I've been reading FA, so far I've been carving through most of the first half one month into 2nd year.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Thanks! The post by /U/Trendelenburg is beautiful, and should be very helpful.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I talked to my advisor, he says I most likely test poorly, because he doesn't doubt I know the material (he is our pharmacology prof). He suggested I read the question and write down exactly what it is asking. For example, a question about treating dry mouth. He suggested I write "treat xerostomia" then answer that question and look for the answer among the choices. This was one of the questions for this past exam, I know the answer is cevimeline, but I read the question as what is used to block secretions.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Always get Bs. | I know the material cold. Take my time on the exam. but still bang out like an 80. I dont know whats going on, any advice?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	This is true, should have said that you know you are capable of more 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Thanks everyone, it's really frustrating when you study well but don't get the score you deserve.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Thanks so much for your insight, I'm definitely going to do more questions from qbanks!
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I feel like I am making the same mistakes you did, what tips did they offer?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Thanks for the advice, I've been using FA and Pathoma to supplement poor lectures, which has worked well. I don't have a problem learning the material (i.e. I could write down the entire Gram Positive and Gram Negative algorithm if you asked me to), I suppose my issue is the actual answering of questions.  Maybe I need to focus more on testing myself with exam style questions instead of facts like I do with anki currently?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Our exam review is in a week, so I will definitely analyze why I got things wrong. I know at least for pediatrics, they test on things in the powerpoint, that they said, in the book, or that they didnt say but assumed you should have known so simply some knowledge questions definitely. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	So we are Mayweather?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	OMG IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THIS
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Fun fact, AT Still built kirksville on his own, using his own money. Then, when the school was built, the board of governors wouldn't let him teach osteopathic medicine.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	People assume that meant HVLA, some others think it meant functional.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Am a democrat as well, you break the law you get in trouble. Your comment is reasonable. We democrats aren't as rabid as people are led to believe.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	We need education overhaul more than throwing money at it (I wasn't very clear about this before). In terms of healthcare, the market could provide if we allowed people to actually shop around and get an idea what they are paying before hand, rather than after. However, if that turns out to be impossible, universal coverage, whether there single payer or multiplayer does have its merits (cheaper per capita, etc). While anecdotal, my experiences with it have been positive.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Nope, just cutting waste, our men and women need to be equipped properly. Operational readiness should not be sacrificed because of budget concerns.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Yes, I'm not sure where I made it seem like I thought otherwise. When I said streamlined, I mean rigorous but not financially impossible. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I'm not chanting "gut the military" im talking about cutting things like this:   http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/28/pentagon-tells-congress-to-stop-buying-equipment-it-doesnt-need.html  Conservatives tout fiscal conservatism, so it should be a no brainer that inefficiencies in the military are a waste.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Thanks! Honestly, we have too much "party repping" nowadays, almost like cliques in high school. I'm moderate because we can find middle ground almost anywhere. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Frankly, if we stopped wasting so much money on subsidies and the military-industrial complex we could afford things like universal healthcare and better than bottom of the barrel public education. Corporate taxes don't need to change, but wasting tax dollars does. Wages should match inflation. Immigration should be streamlined but it shouldn't be a free pass. Trickle down will never work. I don't believe in massive taxes and free immigration because I'm reasonable, but I don't believe in bending over and taking it for corporations who do not need billions in tax payer assistance.  People like to hem and haw about welfare. Billions to Exxon mobile is where we should start.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Yes I agree with this, bureaucracy adds to the total dollar amount. I don't advocate throwing more at the issue but spending more wisely.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Absolutely agree with everything you said 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	It's definitely a mixing pot of different items. This article does a good job explaining where most of it goes:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/drillinginfo/2016/02/22/debunking-myths-about-federal-oil-gas-subsidies/#589e44076e1c
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Frankly, Europe needs to pay for their own military. We could spend our tax dollars more efficiently, maybe even tax less. I just want a smarter and more efficient government. Yes, I agree the 63 billion-ish we spend on subsidies is a drop in the bucket, but I think we could do with out them if the same said companies post healthy profits every quarter (mostly).
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I'll also lay this one on you, as a democrat, I want welfare to be a stepping stone to a JOB not something that people need to live on.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I don't want more programs, frankly we should reduce some of them. That's why I consider myself fiscally conservative with a liberal social view.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Of course people of all types died, but survival trended by class.  http://www.titanicfacts.net/titanic-survivors.html
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Let's be real here, they died so that a bunch of rich people, many of which didn't really contribute to society, could survive.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	We left when it just started to decline in 2004 with the influx of gangs and less than desirable neighbors. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I'd be okay with this if they gave you a cash sum to go buy your own insurance.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Ehh. Idk. Jobs also talked about thermonuclear war loosely.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Same thing with guns or abortion. Im pro-gun and pro-choice. CHOICE. Lord people piss me off. I guess im in the right sub 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	So about 100 million people.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Damn, that's really depressing.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	[NO SPOILERS] I remade the GoT intro to better match the tone of this season. | 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	What happened to Weston Ranch? | I lived there as a kid, and it was a great place to live. Low crime, etc. What happened?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	That's hilarious, maybe I'll upload a video that just shows the game of thrones logo followed by black 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I also took out some stuff, for example, you may notice 'the twins' are no longer featured. It isn't the most overt remake, but it was really something I just messed around with and wanted to share.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	So an Idahoan will get the job?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	So it has come to this. | 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Go into health-related public policy. Government job? Work for a nonprofit? I think there is a lot you can do with your MD without it having to be clinical.   Also, death threats and hateful comments are deplorable. I am sorry that people are assholes. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Reviewing cards in the order added or randomly while studying? which is better and why? | 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	What I learned:  Go to class. Shut off your laptop/iPad and just listen (minus a few notes) - it's worked for thousands of years, it'll continue to work now. Read the PowerPoint after class and understand the big picture - do not move on to the next step until you have done this. Anki or similar Dealers choice: reread PowerPoint then do anki or just do anki.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I have, they can't seem to find an issue.

CardioSurgeonWannabe	This is true.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	LPT: You are a guest in a public bathroom, treat it as such. | [removed]
CardioSurgeonWannabe	So I did some digging, and it looks like the data the state senator spoke about doesn't exist. So with the current data, I want to amend my statement, that tort reform only decreases malpractice insurance cost for physicians in a quantifiable way.  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1313308  Here is a study that concluded that in states with malpractice reform, it did not change the intensity of practice of EM physicians.  tl:dr memory didn't serve, politicians have agendas.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Give me some time to find the report, but if memory serves, the number of lawsuits that would have lost anyways dropped.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Lot's of different facets to this, including patient's suing for no reason.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	True, I'm just going off of how the number of lawsuits dropped in Indiana after tort reform 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	2% is still 2%, which is why I said the issue is multifaceted. I don't believe there is a smoking gun so if we can improve savings in multiple ways that can help. Also tort reform isn't ubiquitous, however, some states are currently working on it currently.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	The exact one I cringed while watching 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Best cringe post/video? | I haven't seen any good cringe material lately. Does anyone have any good medicine-related cringe material?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	OMG that's great, and terrible. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I had to stop after 90 seconds. That was too cringe-worthy for me.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Die juden?
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I can see it now "I see you are a single mother? Would you have aborted your child?"
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Real gunner would say, no friends, only people to take advantage of. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Of course they do, we have the touch.
CardioSurgeonWannabe	I feel you. I tried everything. I know learning styles are generally BS, but personally, I feel like I need a mixture of audio and visual. 
CardioSurgeonWannabe	basically M1 was me trying to figure out how to study. I think i have it now? But we will see over M2
CardioSurgeonWannabe	Basically. Like i just made 4 cards in hyperplasia and hypertrophy. What they are, what is their mechanism, which tissues can only undergo hypertrophy, and what is an example of pathologic hyperplasia that doesnt increase the risk for cancer (BPH).

Shookies	Is no one going to talk about the creepy guy with glasses looking at the camera? Looks like he's not supposed to be seen there or something
Shookies	The model looks good, but the composition is really lacking. What i think will improve: 1) Try creating a textureless plane or a podium, since the desert texture doesnt really look good.  2) Try a more cinematic lighting setup... It can make a SHIT-TON of difference in the composition (example: [1 light source](https://i.imgur.com/GHdxddJ.jpg) / [3 point lighting](https://i.imgur.com/15DhUKu.jpg) . And that's before playing with the light colors)  Search google for '3 point lighting' to help you better understand how and why. Hope this helps!

Shookies	Does anyone here have experience with the site Big Apple Buddy | I'm from Israel and i'm looking for options to order a Nexus and get it shipped over here... so far the only option I got is to use Big Apple Buddy (For those who dont know it's a site that lets your order stuff to them and they ship it to you anywhere in the world). So i was wondering if anyone had any experience with that site or something similar?  And another question (Just making sure here) - Ordered from the google store, the nexus would work with any international sim right?  Thanks in advance
Shookies	Questions regarding accessories | I'm considering buying a Nexus 6P but i'm having trouble finding information on accessories.  1. [I use full ear headphones with a huge headphone jack (Audio Technica ATH-M50)](https://i.imgur.com/Oax31JE.jpg) that wont fit into regular cases for phones. My current phone case has a rubber top so it doesn't interfere with the jack, but i'm worrying the 6P cases won't be so convenient. Does anyone here have these kind of headphones and if so, what did you do to make it work?  2. Obviously there still aren't any arm bands for taking the 6P running. Is there any alternative that you guys are using for  exercise?  Thanks in advance!

Hope i'm not alone in this... 
Shookies	A rule of thumb for clean topology should be even spacing between the verts. anything that's supposed to pinch in or out should be dense and anything not should be spread out evenly. Try not to have drastic changes in the vertex density.   You can try the 'smooth' paint effect brush. That helps space them out evenly (Although it might change your mesh size, so watch out for that)  Not sure what you mean by 'iffy' but check you have double faces beneath or if your normals are facing the correct way.  Other things that i think will drastically improve the final composition is adding some texture to the wheels so they wont be that smooth, and changing the lighting to be a bit more engaging. Right now it looks like there's a light really close to the vehicle which makes it look over-saturated a bit. Don't know if you know the 3 point lighting set up but that almost always works for me when showcasing things.  Good luck!
Shookies	Where to start when starting to learn animation? | I already know the other stuff (modelling, shading etc) and i want to start doing some animation in maya. The question is what exercise should i start from? I already did the ol' bouncing ball, and after that the bouncing ball with tail, and i think i'm ready to move on to some character animation. I thought about starting out doing walk cycles and then moving on from there?  Whats a good measured approach to this so i won't be overwhelmed?

Shookies	halp! with UVs | No idea why this is happening, nor could i find anything online for it.  whenever i try the unfold button on the UV texture editor (The one where there's 'relax' also) the selected UVs just disappear...  [Before](http://imgur.com/hdtDeLN), [After](http://imgur.com/ZBp8CUx)  This works properly on other scenes but only on this one it gives me problems... **EDIT**: this seems to be the problem only with one shell...

How can i use this to impress people who will be watching? (Except making better stuff, which will happen as time passes :P)  
Shookies	really cool! i love these kinds of clips  the font you used though doesn't fit well in my opinion, there are a lot of better options to choose from i think...  keep on rockin
Shookies	really nice!  If you plan on rigging this i'd add something to represent the elbow so it'll move correctly... + adding some variation on the colors could help too... like making it fade in some places or adding some dirt

Shookies	check out [Elemental Ray](https://elementalray.wordpress.com/), it's a  blog run by a lighting and render artist who knows what he's talking about. he really gets into the nitty gritty when it comes to these types of things 
Shookies	I think tutorials following the customary pipelines for creating any detailed asset or character could always be useful...  There are tons of sculpting tutorials on the web but what was a bit harder to find were the ones on continuing the pipeline after, like  projecting the details and rendering... 
Shookies	>Oy, and though you might not want to hear it, it might be better for you to start again from scratch!!  This! fellow noob here. if you keep on sculpting the same head all over again and again you'll see a really steep improvement curve from model to model. keep on rockin!
Shookies	Fluid + Fields issue | Now, I'm maybe just missing a simple check box or something as small as that, but i'm having trouble finding a solution here or anywhere else on google.  My goal is to create a flamethrower effect using maya fluids, but i'm having trouble controlling the fluid with fields. Specifically whenever i try to apply a certain field to the container it simply does nothing to it. I tried every single field and bumped the magnitude to maximum but it doesn't seem to affect anything in the container. I made sure the "use fields" check box is checked and the field and container are connected   Another issue (And i'm not sure if its related or not) is when i try to create a volume axis field it seems to create only a dot instead of the field itself (Like there's no cube or cylinder or whatever to represent the volume axis field).  [here's a screenshot of the issue](http://imgur.com/S9FwWyz) 
Shookies	Thanks for taking the time to look into it. I tried it in a new scene like you said and it worked out fine, so the problem was in the scene itself i guess. I exported everything i needed from the old one out and opened up a new scene and it seems to work now so all is good. Do you know what may have caused this so i may avoid it in the future? Thanks again for the help!  **EDIT**: Seems like the problem was with viewport 2.0. Once i opened a new scene i changed it from the default quality rendering to viewport 2 and the same problem occurred.  
Shookies	The only thing that annoys me is that his other tracks don't sound anywhere near how good this track is... I guess he's a one-hit-wonder

Shookies	Very nice!  My opinion is that the buttons should be taken back by just a bit. The remote looks kinda like a toy with those big buttons. Also you can improve the lighting on your scene for this specific shot, since only one side of the headphones are well lit.  Keep going!
Shookies	My first try at Motion graphics (Tell me how I did!) | 
Shookies	Thanks for the kind words i'll take them as a compliment!  if you'd take a moment to look at my vimeo page (the one i use for all my projects) i dont have any other motion graphics there. The reason i use these 3D techniques is that i'm studying Maya as my major and i know how to use it to my advantage.

Shookies	I Tried to do that but i get weird results... the comp im trying to fit moves and rotates the way it should more or less but its still not aligned to the nulls...   here's a screencap of the project if that helps any  https://imgur.com/nb1FVo7

Shookies	Placing a layer in between 4 nulls (in a screen) | I'm sure i'm missing something basic here, but i've searched thoroughly for some time without finding any results. I'm trying to fit a comp in between 4 null objects (Which are imported from Maya, not from the normal tracker in AE). I know there's a Video Copilot tutorial doing exactly this but it relates to the camera tracker in AE and i didn't get any results trying the same on the nulls (Create corner pin and parent the positions... gave an error).  What would be the best approach to this?  Thanks in advance! 
Shookies	I Recreated the top picture here (Woman in Blue) with polygons for a school exercise | 
Shookies	Another question regarding tracking a phone screen | Some doodling around the internet revealed that After Effects can read MA files from Maya, so you can use it to import a camera and locator for tracking just like the tutorial for C4D that i posted earlier. So i've been doing a similar animation  of a Galaxy S5 but i'm having trouble animating the locator to stay on the screen... Because animation is in the group i can't just copy the keyframes over because there are none for the screen (only the group)... does anyone have an idea of how i can "stick" the locator to them middle of the screen?  **tl;dr: How can i copy the animation/position of an object that is being animated inside a group? (The animation is happening on the group level)**   Thanks again in advance!
Shookies	I've tried to duplicate the phone screen and replacing the duplicate with the locator, but the reason this isnt helping is because when i import the scene into After Effects the phone group is also imported with the locator parented to it
Shookies	I wish a lot more people would do this with videos of live shows... much more entertaining watching it this way
Shookies	Can I get the same results with maya from this tutorial on C4D+ After Effects? | http://www.schoolofmotion.com/project/30dae_29_3dcomping/  In this tutorial the artist uses Cineware to import the scene directly into After effects, allowing him to use the null object he had in the C4D scene directly in AE, giving him an easy time to track the screen.  Can this be replicated in Maya or do i need to use regular motion tracking software (Mocha?) to get the same results?  Thanks in advance!

sexybiceps69	We both know that other people die as well right ? :P But there is actually a theory that says almost all of our actions can be credited to the fact that we know we will cease to exist and try to leave a mark on the world that can outlive us. 
sexybiceps69	Honestly, I have no idea. Some say there is no meaning at all. That none of us matter and chances are you may just lead an average life. That does sound accurate so far to me. Others try to find some meaning in the emotions we experience and the good deeds we perform. But I think a better question would be "Why do we need there to be a meaning/purpose to life?" I wouldn't want my life bogged down to a single purpose. Isn't having no purpose a better (much free-er) way to live life. Then again whatever floats your boat.

willingisnotenough	Every good actor has been in at least one bad movie. What's your example of a bad actor in a great film? | 
willingisnotenough	Honestly the book nerd in me just wants a new movie because I'm hoping it'll encourage new hardcover additions of the book to come out that don't cost $300.
willingisnotenough	I think you got this one backwards. XD
willingisnotenough	Here's what I love - that in spite of any individual's cynicism. we persevere. We continue to advance, in wisdom and technology, doing greater and greater things, fighting each other less, communicating more, growing in understanding of so many things and becoming gradually less intrusive on the environment. The world is filled with people full of disdain for their own species, but still, all things being equal, we are doing better all the time, creating a society so prosperous and peaceful that we take it for granted and scoff.
willingisnotenough	YES, this is the version I played. So fun.
willingisnotenough	OMG yes. I really think this movie is underrated.
willingisnotenough	There was talk of a live-action The Last Unicorn a few years back that never got off the ground, and I was so happy because every time I checked the production page there was worse news about the unicorn:  "Okay we know we said fully CGI unicorn but turns out we're gonna go with horses with CGI overlay, it'll look great we promise."
willingisnotenough	Every time people mention the Hobbit it reaffirms my decision to deny its existence.
willingisnotenough	Someone saved me. | This isn't what inspired me to look for this subreddit. I had a couple of dreams recently that were interesting and/or upsetting, but this sub got me thinking.  One of the dreams that has stayed with me over the years is one in which a young man sends me away from his side in the belief that I will be safe if we split up. He was directing me to go into a palace, which was nearly deserted or maybe its inhabitants were asleep or out somewhere. Anyway, he wanted me to go in, to hide or look for help, and he was going to make sure that some other people with evil intent didn't find me. I didn't know who they were or why they wanted to hurt us/capture us, and honestly I felt like a visitor in the dream and didn't entirely know what was going on. Like I had been transported into another identity and now had to stumble my way through being another person with another history.  But I had met this man and he told me I was important, and I had faith in him. And he in turn had faith in me. I wish I could remember what he said, but he essentially told me that he didn't completely understand who I was or where I'd come from, but he knew I was special. He knew I was there to do good, and that I didn't deserve to be hunted, and that he was happy to protect me.  I wasn't sure if I was really as important as he said I was, b but his profound belief in me was so real that I couldn't argue with him. I had to respect his faith in me. So I left him there at the forest edge and went to find my way through the palace, and I knew that the hunters would find him, and he wouldn't survive.  The last thing I remember was seeing a colored glass orb the size of a pool ball, clattering down some marble steps inside the palace, and I knew it meant death. Whether for me, or for that youth who believed in me, I never knew.
willingisnotenough	Perhaps she liked you as a person and thought that attraction would come eventually. Perhaps she felt shallow for caring what you looked like or what race you were and wanted to prove to herself that she takes everyone as they are.  I'm a white woman who generally isn't attracted to white men. I'm slightly worried that someday I'll pursue a relationship with a white man just to prove to myself that I can take people as they are and that I don't fetishise the group I am attracted to.
willingisnotenough	I try not to. Thanks. 😊
willingisnotenough	This happened to me when I was trying to get an electric piano home by myself. The instrument started to fall off the hand truck I was using and a good samaritan grabbed it roughly, pushed it upright and forced it back into a balanced position on the hand truck... breaking one of the keys in the process.
willingisnotenough	It'll happen honey.
willingisnotenough	I use this one often, along with an ebook app that shows definitions, so when I'm browsing on my phone I get super frustrated.
willingisnotenough	What does his being adopted and his adoptive parents dying early have to do with this story?  How am I the only one who asked this?!  
willingisnotenough	Not even. She's described as being about eighteen when Fitz goes to "pick her up" in the Mountains, and when the first series ends around three years later (making Kettricken about twenty-one) Fitz is twenty.
willingisnotenough	A very tired, possibly surly woman usually dressed for the gym, but never at the gym.  I'm rarely as tired or surly as I look.
willingisnotenough	Actually I forgot the Snoo (sorry!) but it will be hard to miss us, and if you're unsure the folks at the counter should be able to point us out. And we will notice people looking like they're looking for someone!
willingisnotenough	[09/14] Board Games at Hex & Co. (UWS) 6:30pm | Hey! Repeating the meetup from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nycmeetups/comments/6yjshy/907_anyone_want_to_try_the_new_board_game_cafe/?st=j7jdjxwg&sh=f65016d1). The first meetup at Hex and Co went so well last week that I couldn't wait to have another one, so I'll be there again tomorrow (Thursday) night.  Hex and Co is a new board game cafe just opened on Broadway between 111th and 112th. We had plenty of space last week but I'll be calling ahead to let them know to expect a Reddit group. Hope to see some of you there!  **Edit: forgot my snoo unfortunately but will be keeping an eye out for folks with that "I don't know who I'm looking for" look, and will ask the counter to keep in mind where we're sitting.**
willingisnotenough	I'll bring a Reddit snoo for the table again but since I'm telling the shop to expect us, the people at the counter can point newcomers to the meetup as well. So yeah just show up!
willingisnotenough	Also want to keep /u/sprachkundige /u/sunnychance and /u/BenjiSponge in the loop as well as /u/asiangeeknyc who missed us last time.
willingisnotenough	$10 per person buys gaming all day, you just pay at the counter.
willingisnotenough	Hey Allison, looking forward to playing with you again!
willingisnotenough	Thank you John! I definitely want to talk to Greg, would love to make an official group.
willingisnotenough	"Normally" isn't really a thing yet since it's just the second meetup, but the shop has something for everyone. Last week we played two rounds of Splendor and a card game called Set.
willingisnotenough	I'm hoping to make it a weekly thing and a quarter to 8 isn't too late.
willingisnotenough	Great, see you there!
willingisnotenough	Last time we were there until about 10-10:30. I'd say it's worth stopping by if you're close!
willingisnotenough	While what you say is true, the quote is more inflammatory than motivational. The oversimplification destroys the message.
willingisnotenough	So it was my fault all that emotional abuse made me feel worthless, got it.
willingisnotenough	Not hate. Indifference.  Bunch of savages standing in the way of their shady enterprise. Less than human because they have never left their jungle home and simple ways.
willingisnotenough	Legit just ran across a dating profile today where the first thing they said was, "I don't read much and I am not a book person."  Who are they trying to attract with that?!
willingisnotenough	Ha, I remember watching that episode when it aired and being PISSED for about three minutes because I watched the X-Files religiously and wanted my fix.
willingisnotenough	Reading your comment made me remember how this episode made me feel, not any details about the episode itself. Totally creepy feeling, to be unsettled by a still-buried memory.
willingisnotenough	Agreed, Nina's fate hit much harder in the original series. I was always disappointed they rushed through the early part of the story in Brotherhood, mainly because both Nina and Hughes had less of an impact because of it. I don't mind watching all that exposition and character development again, writers.
willingisnotenough	Some people are metaphors, some people are like similes.
willingisnotenough	Pacing refers to the pace and smoothness with which the viewer is led through the interactions and events which are pertinent to the plot of the story. When a story has poor pacing it could mean there are a lot of lulls between major plot developments or that the viewer is led too quickly and messily from one major event to the next without time left over for things like character development.  I think?
willingisnotenough	Man I hope we can preserve those animals on earth. Cheetahs are the best.
willingisnotenough	For some reason I never got why this episode was too disturbing for broadcast TV, but I will admit that the scene with the sheriff and his wife at their house... well that was... hard to watch.
willingisnotenough	The episode of Punky Brewster where her best friend gets trapped and suffocates in an old refrigerator while playing hide and seek.
willingisnotenough	Mostly. Many mammals have naturally occurring pale color mutations resulting in things like white fur and blue eyes. Most mammalian eyes are brown or black and shades of gold are common too, as in foxes or lions for example.
willingisnotenough	LOL. Too subtle for me to notice what that was about.
willingisnotenough	There was an episode of House where they had a patient who had never had a kid after ??? years of marriage, and explained that when she first started having sex it was very difficult and painful. Turned out her husband had somehow stretched out and was penetrating her urethra.  SHUDDER.
willingisnotenough	"You see, sir, no woman in history has ever achieved conception by way of a fist to the face."
willingisnotenough	I couldn't tell you which episode it was, she was not the "main mystery patient" of her episode but one of the patients he saw when forced to see clinic patients.
willingisnotenough	The key word being growing. Mostly we don't think about the difference between aging and growing, but it's aging that kills us. Growing is what we do up until about our early twenties. Aging is why our bodies break down slowly beyond that time.
willingisnotenough	If it helps, remember this is also how our brains can recognize little subtle danger signals that the conscious mind would miss.
willingisnotenough	One of the few in the thread that actually blew my mind.
willingisnotenough	Relative to our body mass, sure.
willingisnotenough	I had to listen to the fourth one on audiobook, or I never would have finished.
willingisnotenough	One can only hope that by the time we defeat aging in ourselves we'll have the wisdom to handle it.
willingisnotenough	I was foiled by clouds too, after flying out to Missouri from New York and driving two hours to try to outrun the clouds that poured in. Sun was hazy but visible right until the moment of totality, then a fucking rain cloud passed over it for 90 seconds.  Very much agreed that clouds can go die.
willingisnotenough	Thanks Greg! You run a cool shop.
willingisnotenough	There will be! I will post again sooner than later.
willingisnotenough	The actions that make those words true.  Anyone can say I love you. Fools say it, abusers say it, liars say it, the ignorant and the reckless and the greedy say it.  And a hundred cultures don't have the custom of asserting those feelings out loud. But when you feel it you make sure you show it, in how you help and how you listen, how you work together, share jokes and fears and hopes for the future. And even in how you fight, you show it in how you won't seek to cause hurt or guilt or confusion, won't reserve all thought for your own feelings, won't shut down or run away.
willingisnotenough	Voters.
willingisnotenough	Wait... you'd never ask for a nice burger?
willingisnotenough	Was really confused how NYC could support a community of people who fly small single-person aircraft.
willingisnotenough	Damn those are cool dogs though.
willingisnotenough	We were glad to have you there!
willingisnotenough	The evidence is actually pretty strong for this one if you don't judge by what's on the news.
willingisnotenough	That I am worthy of being loved 
willingisnotenough	That was my understanding when I asked. I even asked about varying rates since Uncommons charges more on weekends, they just said for $10 you can play as long as you want.
willingisnotenough	I didn't think to ask but can't imagine they would mind unless people bring their own games intending to get around the fee and/or not buy anything at the cafe.
willingisnotenough	That's fine! Likely we'll be wrapping up the first round of games then and looking to start a new round.
willingisnotenough	[9/07] Anyone want to try the new board game cafe near Columbia? | I stopped in there the day they opened, seems like a decent amount of space and a lot of games to choose from, most of which I wasn't familiar with but always up to try.  The place is called Hex&Co, at Broadway and W. 112th. I'm thinking 6:30? Unlimited gaming is $10/person. I'm  34/f just looking to meet some folks and play some games.  Edit because like a dumb I assumed everyone already knew what board game cafe I was talking about.  **Edit 2: Thanks everyone who came out! Will 100% plan another one in a week or two, it was a lot of fun!**
willingisnotenough	Yay! I'll be there, I'll bring a printed snoo so I'm easy to spot.
willingisnotenough	Excellent! See the thread for how to spot us!
willingisnotenough	Really just inviting people to join, I'll bring along a paper reddit snoo so people can pick me/the group out.
willingisnotenough	Not sure but I can ask tomorrow.
willingisnotenough	It's called Hex & Co. Maybe another time!
willingisnotenough	Hex & Co! Added an edit. Would be great to see you there!
willingisnotenough	She fell into a relationship with my emotionally abusive older brother without talking to me about it, yet feeling comfortable flirting with him under my nose without acknowledging anything.  After I confronted her, I said some pretty awful things. She was ashamed for not telling me, but so shocked by my reaction that she retreated from me. She broke every promise I made her give me - that she would still spend time with me, and that she wouldn't talk to him about me (any knowledge he has of me is inevitably used to hurt me). The only promise she kept was that she would let me know where she was when she was spending time with him - which was all the time.  This all started when we moved in together. After a while, I wore her down with guilt so badly that she admitted she had given up on the friendship. I moved out, but I neglected to convey to her that I just thought we needed to be apart for a while - a rational part of my mind knew that the relationship had an expiration date.  After I moved out, he had full access to poison her mind against me, especially since I had stopped speaking to him and this allowed him to play the victim and try to put her in the middle, asking her to speak to me on his behalf. I got angry with her about that... I could have told her it was wrong of him to make her his middleman.  By the time they broke up and my heart had healed toward her, hers had closed to me.  I miss you, Jessie. Eleven years later.
willingisnotenough	Yeah no doubt he didn't know meth was bad before he took it.
willingisnotenough	The dangers of shallow water to a vehicle totally escaped me as a teenager, fortunately I never had an opportunity to ruin a car in more than six inches of water.
willingisnotenough	PLEASE!
willingisnotenough	What about the fact that the Skill and the Wit are such understated magics? Would be exceptionally tricky to show things like how Fitz can't sense the Forged ones for example.
willingisnotenough	I disagree with you here. The only similarities between the two stories are that they are both set in medieval feudalist countries. Beyond that, the actual plots are wildly different and the Elderlings books focus on a central hero.
willingisnotenough	But Fitz didn't age much after his mid-30's...
willingisnotenough	I can't believe how far down I had to scroll to find this.
willingisnotenough	Crazy how one person can get shot in the head and survive while another can trip on the sidewalk and hit their head in just the right way...
willingisnotenough	Also voting Animal Care and Control, if the emphasis is on rescue - no kill shelters and rescue groups obviously need adopters but the urgency is not the same. ACC's adoption process has been improving dramatically in the last few years and the fees never exceed $200.  One thing to keep in mind is breed preferences, if you have any. Private rescues tend to snap up all of the purebreeds and "cute mutts" so ACC is about 80%-90% pitbulls and small dogs with minor to major health issues.
willingisnotenough	I saw a tiny star-sized light rise up from the western horizon just after sunset. It ascended at about the same rate of speed as if you were watching a passenger jet high overhead, and just a few degrees above the horizon, it stopped, grew slowly to about twice its brightness/size, then faded into nothing.  Everybody rolls their eyes at me when I tell this story, incorrectly inferring that I believe it was an alien craft. I don't know what it was, it was just something really strange I can't explain.
willingisnotenough	You look really nice today!
willingisnotenough	Most of the villains in Naruto, as Naruto and co. beat them all into a return to virtue sooner or later.
willingisnotenough	We're all too scared of "the devil we don't know" to vote for a third party candidate and are more preoccupied with making sure the guy we hate the most doesn't win.
willingisnotenough	This honestly confounds me sometimes because I know there are people who think that I am just the worst kind of person, when I try so hard to be the best kind of person.
willingisnotenough	Walking down Broadway in the Hudson Heightsb area of NYC. Come at me, stalkers!
willingisnotenough	I'm a third of the way through Fool's Assassin by Robin Hobb. I'm reading it because even though the plot is far-fetched and the story even weaker than the last trilogy, I love me some Fitz+Fool.  I pretend it's fanfiction written by the original author.
willingisnotenough	I had a couple of friends/acquaint who would write this way and it always made them sound wishy washy and unsure of themselves.
willingisnotenough	I think this generation's 8-18 year-olds have the excuse that they weren't around or weren't old enough to enjoy the films, and they still deserve some consideration.
willingisnotenough	But you can't get rid of all the food particles and their bacteria. You can soak a turd in dishwater, but until you wash the whole thing down to the sewers it's still a piece of shit.
willingisnotenough	I have a feeling I'm supposed to write a funny "mom" answer but my mom was a libertarian politician so...  Decriminalization of drugs would be near the top of the first things she would do. 
willingisnotenough	This doesn't make any sense, the Moon would have had to take a sharp turn to the North.
willingisnotenough	Parents, birth parents and children of open adoption, what has it been like remaining in contact after adoption? | 
willingisnotenough	Being one ethnicity (white) and attracted to another (Asian) can be difficult. If you're too upfront about it, it comes off like a fetish, but if you downplay it to yourself, the people you're interested in may assume no interest could exist.  I sometimes think my being a woman makes it worse, there's something like three times as many white men with Asian women as there are couples in the reverse.
willingisnotenough	DIY tips for organizing Fabric storage bins without shelves? | [removed]
willingisnotenough	Oh she's got stuff to store, I think she's just frustrated with the prospect of more furniture into the room (the needed shelves).
willingisnotenough	Reading this scared the pants of me, and I was already terrified. The inability to go more than ten minutes without noise or distraction is literally ruining my life, and it's no comfort to know that I may simply be the unwitting victim of countless corporate minions with designs on my attention.
willingisnotenough	I was a good person in my 20s and never spent more than I made but I'm still floundering. I suspect you're leaving something out there pal.

keenanmorgannow	Review: IF IT AIN'T BROKE: Black Folks and Family Structure - Modern Day Kay | 
keenanmorgannow	Is humanistic greed the reason for single parent homes? | 
keenanmorgannow	Bro, I don't want you to think that I don't respect your opinion because I do, but I couldn't disagree with you any more. The fact that you are suggesting that I follow a **rule** of quote formatting is quite interesting and a bit ironic. With that said, I have no problem using quote formatting if it is helpful to you and other readers. If I can follow that rule, why is it so difficult for you to understand the rule of male leadership within the home, which has been set by religious institutions (primarily Judeo-Christian), who believe it to be established by God? The rules are there for your benefit. To my comment on historical civilizations and the operation of major religions, you stated:  > And somehow this means it's required of all men?  This wasn't suggesting the establishment of a theocracy. Even if it was, people still have the ability to break the rules if they choose. They also have to deal with the consequences of their choices. This reference identifies that there has been an order in place throughout history that recognizes male leadership in the home. Do you have to live your life that way? No, but you have to deal with the consequences similar to the example stated above.  >  Honestly this article reads like a religious person trying to rationalize why porn is immoral.  I didn't get that from the article, but I respect your opinion. I don't even remember it referencing porn in relation to morality. A nonreligious person can see the affects that porn has on a person's psyche and decision making.   > It all boils down to the fact that the article was confusing porn use with porn addiction.  You're kidding me right? Okay, go take a couple hits from a crack pipe and then explain to me the difference between crack use and addiction. There was a slogan that came out in the 80's that said " Just say no". This was a precautionary statement made predicated upon the observations of drugs affects on people. No morality there, simply reason. I think this article reflects the same sentiments regardless of the writers religious affiliations. 
keenanmorgannow	BS? Why exactly? Because you don't agree? People would be desperate for sex (and controlled by sex) without porn. Are you saying that porn somehow satisfies a person's sexual desire? I would highly disagree. Porn only intensifies the sexual desire. You satisfy yourself by masturbating. Oddly enough, you repeat this process and it turns into an addiction. You said, "If you let your girl use sex to control you that's your own fault."  That statement suggest a man knowingly allows his lady to manipulate him. This places the woman in the position of a villain. A scenario like this is definitely valid, but the problem is a bit deeper. The article is not identifying  the woman as the problem, its identifying some men's uncontrollable relationship to sex as the problem. Finally, who decided men are supposed to be leaders? Virtually every civilization known to man, including the major religions on earth have operated this way. The article makes reference to men leading their homes. What does your faith say about men as leaders?

Fireheart318s_Reddit	What mispronunciation pisses you off to no end? | 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	New-kyuh-lurr instead of new-clear. It's new-clear, people!
Fireheart318s_Reddit	With a Guh, a Juh, or a Jee Eye Eff?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	My mom. 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	How do bombers maneuver in combat? | Typically, a bomber will be escorted by several fighters, which will do most of the fighting for the bomber, but how does the bomber fly?  I'm asking this to determine the number of crew for a plane I'm building in KSP. Also, could the pilot be in control of an aim-able gun (one that's not pointing in only one direction)?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	My cousins have 'ChocolateNetwork'. It might be a joke, or maybe it's just a name. Either way, that's the best name I've seen personally
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I caught some hackers again | 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Is it still considered aerodynamics if you're concerned with moving through water? | Or is it hydrodynamics or something?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	A subreddit for talking about old, obscure games | Things you played during your childhood. Stuff like Speed Racer the Videogame and maybe some Hotwheels games and stuff
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Are Avatar: The Last Airbender/Legend of Korra/??? and the Avatar movie with the blue people the same thing? | Are they the same franchise? I've never seen either, if you couldn't tell
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Not exactly what you're looking for, but r/worldbuilding has a lot of stuff like that
Fireheart318s_Reddit	[Trying to be unique here] Uhhh... lets see - one of my all-time favorites is Just Cause 3 - the game's just amazing for mindless fun. Halo 4 is still a good game, despite what people say. And Forza Horizon 3  If you're looking for another PlayStation game, Speed Racer the Videogame is still surprisingly fun, even though it's going onto 10 years now. I'm not sure if it's compatible with the PS4, but it does work on the PS3. I played it on the Wii when it was first released
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I'm not sure, but Captainsparklez made a video on a sub like that a while ago
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Hoping to finally hit 40 subs with my Kommunity Space Station video. Just got a new flash drive so I can edit on the go
Fireheart318s_Reddit	My mom definitely applies
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Okay then. Thanks for clearing that up. Still, one more question - where can I get one without a sealed ink well?  [Btw, this is the demo I looked up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Li4YlF0k_4)
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Kinda
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Why are rockets shaped like dicks? | Or perhaps a better question, why are dicks shaped like rockets? Either way, why? It's gotta be something with aerodynamics or something, right? This is a serious question!
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Yes, that. The demo I looked up had a head that moved and allowed ink to flow through onto the tip. I guess it's a fountain pen, but it functions like a ballpoint 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Warriors: Rising Storm (?)  One of my favorite characters, Silversteram died while giving birth to a litter of kits. It was DEVASTATING to my 8 yo mind
Fireheart318s_Reddit	HMF this one song from a KSP video | I can't find the video I'm talking about, but it's a Kerbal Space Program video about an SSTO. It's very heroic-sounding and the video linked for the song has a knight (looks similar to Reinhardt from Overwatch) in it. The knight moves slightly in a looped GIF. I think he's holding an axe or sword, but not a hammer  Sorry I'm being so vague here, but it's all I can remember
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Yeah but how?

I have an external hard drive (flashdrive) plugged into the computer. How do I install Steam on this drive?  Not just games, the entire thing  Thanks in advance

Fireheart318s_Reddit	Hi Asriel 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I bought the Anne Pro on Flashquark and now the lights aren't working properly. How long is the warranty? | My teacher dropped it and now the lights are all the wrong color. How long is the warranty?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Yeah, the green keys are pretty dim (especially when they shouldn't even be on)
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I did. No reply.
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Okay but what is really happening here?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	My lights are the wrong color | I think my green RGBs have somehow (almost completely) burnt out on the entire keyboard. The orange keys are now almost totally red, light blue are hot pink, and red are faint green. What's going on here?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Plain cheese please 
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I'm just fed up with the constant teamshooting. I run into a room at full health and pop a damage rift at the entrance. I'm about to kill the guy when his buddy runs into the room and suddenly it's like I'm nealt on the ground in front of an 8-person firing squad!
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I just think it's a little unfair. They could've put the Xbox copies on the energy drink side and the extra Playstation copies where the Xbox copies are
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I mean, it looked pretty light, but it didn't have a spinning mechanism at the bottom. I probably could've spun it, but I didn't want to break anything or get in trouble

Fireheart318s_Reddit	In a bathroom at my school, none of the stalls have doors. Why is that? | The stalls don't have doors. Why? I feel like this is illegal, or at least immoral
Fireheart318s_Reddit	It'll work, maybe even after the first bump. The scooter has higher drag behind the point it's being held at, so it'll self-stabilize, just like a normal bike wheel.

Fireheart318s_Reddit	I see what you mean, but the weird thing is it's only one bathroom (that I know of) and it's near the dean's office

Fireheart318s_Reddit	Why don't built-in website search bars work? | You see that little search bar up and to the right? It's one of the better ones and it's still terrible!  The built-in search bar on every website always gathers all the information you DON'T need. It's supposed to search that particular site, right? Not all of the internet.  I can't find an example, but you know what I mean, right?  Edit - [Found one!](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/mixednumbers.php) It's at the top of the page. Just type 'fractions' and see what you get

Fireheart318s_Reddit	Dude. That's like saying 'If you don't like bullies just be homeschooled.'
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I - Overpriced everything. Just WHY!?!?!? I don't have a lot of time to play, and I'm too poor to afford a Shark card, which is against my moral code anyways  .  II - Planes are difficult to fly. It might just be me being used to KSP's flight controls, but I can't fly a plane in this game for more than 5 minutes without crashing  .  III - Hackers. I'm fine with the people who give you money, dress you up like a christmas tree, spawn cool cars for you, etc.. What I have a problem with are [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrL0e8ll8Xg) (Skip to about 4:50)  .  IV - Griefers. They arguably fall in the same vein as hackers, but I'm putting them here instead. I hate it when someone just flies around the map in a Hydra blowing everyone up. Or they could just be spamming the N-word and C-word in chat. Either way, ban them all.  V - The people who join your organization and don't help. Also, the ones that ONLY help. It's rather annoying when you have someone join your organization only to completely ignore you and do their own thing, often getting you and the actually helpful people in the organization caught in the crossfire. There's also the jerks who kill "their" cars on purpose, just to annoy you. Finally, there's the people who do NOTHING but help you. I'm very grateful that people spend such a long time helping me out out of the kindness of their hearts, but I feel kinda guilty at the same time. Like I'm taking advantage of them. Thanks, Cookie, but you don't need to help 24/7
Fireheart318s_Reddit	The only good ones are the ponytail and that sorta long one. All the others are just blech

Fireheart318s_Reddit	No, that's not what I meant. Your answer was much more descriptive and clever. The other ones just were a little odd. Also, I interpreted your answer as a no as well

Fireheart318s_Reddit	Are people still fighting the Revolutionary War? | In the southern US, some people are still fighting the Civil War. Are some people still fighting the Revolutionary War?  Edit - I know it's a figure of speech.  Edit II - Not just Americans, Brits, and really anyone

Stuff like OBS, clocks, keyboard profiles, etc.. I also need whatever other things I need to set this thing up  The price for the monitor should be under $50  Thanks in advance!
Fireheart318s_Reddit	So wait, O2 is a molecule, right? | Oxygen as it applies in daily life is a combination of two oxygen atoms, or O2. My teacher (not a science teacher) says O2 is not a molecule because it's only one element but doubled up. That's a molecule, right?
Fireheart318s_Reddit	I record every sale, steal, and whatnot for that exact reason. Also just in case anything crazy happens  [I caught a hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrL0e8ll8Xg)

Then post it to r/techsupport or something for recommendations. I just want to be able to monitor some statistics and readouts like OBS, keyboard profiles, etc.

Fireheart318s_Reddit	I'd assume it has something to do with changing values as they're sent out, but I have no idea
Fireheart318s_Reddit	In this case, he was using exploding bullets and teleportation. That being said, lag often looks like teleportation, but follows a logical path, just jittery. There are also some vehicles and weapons with explosive ammo, but this isn't one. The ones that immediately come to mind are the Heavy Sniper Mk2, Hydra, Lazer, Molotok, and Railgun
Fireheart318s_Reddit	~300k for 5 dudes? That's a pretty good salary if you ask me. Of course, this is San Andreas, where a gallon or two of gas costs $105 and a good jacket is $50k. Also, you have to pay another $50k to be able to undo one button
Fireheart318s_Reddit	In both instances, they do die according to the game  I consider someone dead when they whack their head on the steering wheel and no longer react. They could be knocked out, but considering the speed difference between my Zentorno and their Regina, they're totally dead. As for the punch thing, they're knocked out
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Yeah, but I don't even care about paint. I just don't give a shit about paint. Just give me a basic primary and secondary paint color and I'll be happy. I do, however, care about Oppressors and Heavy Sniper Rifles

Fireheart318s_Reddit	Aside from *Operation: Bacon*, I tend to just race around the map at top speed, seeing how long I can drive like a crazy person until I crash.  Also, those SWAT vans they park in the middle of the road are minor obstacles for a Zentorno or other wedge-mobile. Just drive into them and they'll go flying. It's oddly hilarious to watch them tumble around in the air before landing awkwardly
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Does anyone know how many characters you can type in chat at one time? | I'm making a macro to type for me so I don't have to type the same thing over and over again whenever I recruit a new person in my I&E business. How many characters are allowed per chat message?  BTW, the exploit works by getting all the shitty cars (medium and standard range). The game won't give you duplicates until you go over 32(?) cars. Sell the good cars and you'll just keep getting them
Fireheart318s_Reddit	Great, but hold select on controller or press m on keyboard. Inventory. Ammo. Find the ammo you need. For some stupid reason, it doesn't work with an empty Jerry Can, but everything else works

Fireheart318s_Reddit	PROTIP - When shooting with Thermal Vision, wait for your crosshair to turn red before shooting | By doing this, you can be sure you're actually aiming at a person instead of a wall. Also, by holding right on the D-pad or F11 on the keyboard, you can toggle Thermal and Night Vision by flipping the visor up. For some reason you can't be in a vehicle or crouching behind cover to do this

The kid actors were great for the most part. The bullies were also super underdeveloped and went nowhere, but the movie was already 2 hours 15 minutes so I guess there's not much more they could've done there.

Also a big part of what made the original great was the film making itself, I think movies where the concept or story was strongest are best suited for remakes.

mart1373	Everything is being done with the CPA working with the trustee, so idk. They have it covered, but I do know they are passing on the income from the IRA distributions to the beneficiaries. I don't know if they're doing a lump sum or spreading it out, and idk if the trust even holds the IRAs or not.
mart1373	The testamentary trust holds the IRAs, so the distributions would be distributed to the trust and then distributed directly to the beneficiaries. So it would be a distribution of the IRA income directly from the trust. I also do not have the full picture, but that was my understanding of the situation.  Sorry, mixing up the trust and the estate.
mart1373	Mother is Receiving a $200k Inheritance; Need to Get Everything Covered | Hello r/personalfinance! Let me start off and preface by saying that I am an accountant by trade, and in fact I am only about a half year of experience short of being a full-fledged CPA, so I have a pretty good handle of smart finances.   With that being said, my mom's uncle passed away suddenly a few months back and left my mom and her cousins a sizable inheritance, with my mom receiving about $200k, before any taxes on IRA/401k distributions. From a tax perspective, I have my parents covered. However, I am wanting to cover everything to make sure she is making smart choices from a personal finance perspective and for investing.   Below I list out my recommended steps: 1. Set aside appropriate sum to cover federal/state tax on distribution from estate 2. Pay off credit card balances, approx. $10k (been barking up this tree for too damn long) 3. Pay off any miscellaneous debts 4. Set aside reserve fund to avoid getting into credit card debt again 5. Stuff remainder into passive investment account 5(a). Invest 60-40ish in bonds/stocks 5(b). Stay away from high expense ratio funds and exorbitant fees 6. Contribute max contribution limit to Roth IRA annually (dad still works, so still eligible) 7. Go to an attorney and get a will/revocable trust prepared 8. Reevaluate insurance levels (AFAIK they are not over or under insured)   Am I missing anything obvious? Any other recommendations?   My parents do have a mortgage on their house and a second small home for vacations under $100k, but considering the interest rates are low I don't see the benefit of paying off the balances early.

mart1373	!¿Por qué no los dos?!
mart1373	Not with that kind of attitude!
mart1373	It's actually $35k, because the $7,500 tax credit is phasing out soon, not to mention that the tax credit is a nonrefundable credit, meaning you can only take advantage of the full credit if your tax liability exceeds $7,500. By the time you get your Tesla you won't be able to take advantage of the tax credit because the company will have shipped more than the 240k electric vehicles necessary to be phased out.  And to me $35k for a car is pretty expensive. Not to mention Tesla is like the iPhone of car brands back when having an iPhone actually meant you were cooler than everyone else. So it's a humble brag. 
mart1373	Yes
mart1373	I know, I'm just saying mentioning your Tesla purchase is definitely a humble brag. Nothing bad, just complimenting you on the nice humble brag.
mart1373	Nice humble brag there...

mart1373	The fact that there is an agreement of a set division of assets when a divorce occurs cuts the time spent working with an attorney, reduces the stress and anger that is likely to occur with a divorce, and reduces the likelihood that specific emotional assets (family heirloom, for example) are targeted by the other partner for leverage, especially if that asset makes up a significant chunk of pre-marital property for one spouse.  Obviously this is all thrown out the window if one spouse contests the prenup, but at least it's something.

mart1373	They do (from what I've heard), but at the same time I was working anywhere from 55-75 hours a week in the busy season.   This summer I just took a long hard look at where I wanted my life to go, and working tons of hours and sacrificing my sanity and personal life just wasn't what I wanted. I could afford to take the pay cut, so yeah.

Sound-Intellect	[Serious] If you ever have been suicidal, what made you not go through with it? | 
Sound-Intellect	How did this guy ever become president?  More baffling than the election of Trump.
Sound-Intellect	People being sick and living in poverty.
Sound-Intellect	ISIS is rubbish which is why they have already claimed it.
Sound-Intellect	What is something you have to do everyday that you don't enjoy at all? | 
Sound-Intellect	There about 1.6 billion Muslims around the world. Even if a few million of them supported ISIS it would still be less than 1 %. So how could anyone generalise and say all Muslims are terrorists? You will find that there are bad apples amongst every group. Sometimes these can ruin it for the rest.
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, what made you cry last time you cried out of happiness? | 
Sound-Intellect	How do you go through life without ever becoming depressed? | 
Sound-Intellect	What is the first thing you would do if you became a millionaire overnight? | 
Sound-Intellect	What is the worst advice you have given or someone has given you? | 
Sound-Intellect	Sounds like a good job. How come you left in the first place? 
Sound-Intellect	Someone who has never been into games wants to try a game that will make them addicted, which game should they play? | 
Sound-Intellect	What do you think that thing is? That will bring total contentment? 
Sound-Intellect	Wow that's amazing.
Sound-Intellect	Yep. They probably knew who it was straight away. Hope they quickly catch anyone else involved. 
Sound-Intellect	Not saying I don't know is a bad answer. Just asking if you were to come up with an explanation for the existence of the universe , what would it be?
Sound-Intellect	Any idea how they will know?
Sound-Intellect	In your opinion, what is a more rational answer?
Sound-Intellect	In your opinion, what is more rational than an eternal, knowledgeable, all-powerful being with a will of his own being the originator of all that exists? 
Sound-Intellect	People, who have fulfilled their dreams in life, was it worth all the sacrifice? | 
Sound-Intellect	Where did the Big Bang come from?
Sound-Intellect	What if there is no other rational answer than God?
Sound-Intellect	Do you think people will ever know?
Sound-Intellect	[Serious] Atheists, what do you believe is the origin of our universe? | 
Sound-Intellect	Very interesting point 
Sound-Intellect	Why do many people who live comfortable lives and have partners say that there is an emptiness in their lives? | 
Sound-Intellect	I feel for you.  Did it for a few months but on the tube. 
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, how would you sum up your life so far? | 
Sound-Intellect	The former!
Sound-Intellect	Lol thanks for the translation
Sound-Intellect	Because they see through his lies. Plus he is just shameless and shameful. 
Sound-Intellect	[Serious] For people who have overcome lack of confidence in public, how have you done it? | 
Sound-Intellect	What is one thing you would like to say to your boss but can't because you fear getting sacked or into trouble? | 
Sound-Intellect	I can't stand arrogant people. That's probably one of the worst characteristics to have.
Sound-Intellect	Anything not involving minors or vulnerable people. Something like construction work would  accommodate people with criminal backgrounds I think.
Sound-Intellect	Every religion claims to be the true one. This is why I believe in Islam:  1. The concept of God, his attibutes and who he is in line with logic and reason. For example, as muslims we believe in a one, eternal, all powerful being that has always existed and who does not depend on anything or anyone. We also believe that God and his creation are totally seperate so man cannot become god and God cannot become man. God is unique and there is no one like him.   2. Islam is universal. We believe that since the first creation of man, God has revealed to mankind how to live their lives through prophets and messengers. Their main message was: worship God alone and live your life according to his will. Anyone who accepted this message became a muslim. So anyone at anytime at any place on earth can become a muslim.  3. The Quran. As muslims we believe that the Quran is the final revelation and guidance to mankind from God. I honestly believe that anyone who reads the whole Quran with an open mind will come to the realization that it cannot be from other than God.   There is more to say but think that sums it up.
Sound-Intellect	UK has seen so many attacks recently and as a muslim I am absolutely disgusted. I, like the vast majority of muslims, fully condem this and any other terror attacks. I know some people think many muslims support ISIS but that is far from the truth. There about 1.6 billion Muslims around the world. Even if a few million of them supported ISIS it would still be less than 1 %. So how could anyone generalise and say all muslims are terrorists or supporters of terrorism? You will find that there are bad apples amongst every group. Sometimes these can ruin it for the rest.   Having said that, I urge every muslim in the west and around the world to expose ISIS and their likes for what they are; just a bunch of criminals using religion to justify their political views and gains.
Sound-Intellect	Having  contentment and peace in life after recognising the true purpose of life. 
Sound-Intellect	Initially tell her in a jokey way, if that doesn't work, start putting perfume on her feet.
Sound-Intellect	My Internet is slow so pressed post a few times before it got posTed.  Thanks for pointing it out
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, what is the best way to achieve happiness in life? | 
Sound-Intellect	What dream did you fulfill before the age of 30? | 
Sound-Intellect	If only many people thought like you
Sound-Intellect	Very interesting. Thanks for sharing your thoughts 
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, would you do anything to get rich? | 
Sound-Intellect	Read a few reports recently saying something like 25% of Muslims in America being converts and a thousands of Brits converting to Islam every year.  
Sound-Intellect	Read a study by Swansea University (UK) that stated something like 100,000 Brits converting to Islam and a another report mentioned that 25% of all American muslims are converts. My college classmate and a few other people I know also converted to Islam.
Sound-Intellect	That's quite interesting. Thanks for that.
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, why do you think many Americans and Europeans are converting to Islam despite all the current negativity surrounding it? | 
Sound-Intellect	What is the best thing you have done for your parents? | 
Sound-Intellect	Redditors, what is the funniest thing that happened at your work place that you still remember? | 
Sound-Intellect	Once I realized he was a very arrogant person in real life, he ceased being my role model.
Sound-Intellect	If you came across irrefutable proof of the existence of God, and you realized that a certain religion was his true religion, would you dedicate your life to it and follow everything it teaches even if you don't agree with it?  
Sound-Intellect	Having a deep connection with a person and finding comfort in being in there company.
Sound-Intellect	What is the most amazing/impressive thing a stranger has ever done for you? | 
Sound-Intellect	I live for the purpose I believe I was created for. And as a Muslim, I believe that we (humans) are all put on this earth to be tested. Do we follow that which God tells us to do through his messengers and scriptures or do we follow our own desires. Since I am convinced of the existence of God and the validity of Islam, I fully dedicate my whole life to doing that which pleases my creator knowing that he knows what is best for me since he is the one who created me in the first place.   So for me every time it comes to doing something of importance in my life or making a decision, I always make sure that it is something that is pleasing to God. So my whole life is basically dedicated to the worship of God. My day starts with worship and ends with worship. This has brought a great sense of peace and contentment to my life.
Sound-Intellect	[Serious]For those who were once atheists but started to believe in a God, what made you change? | 
Sound-Intellect	Such a terrible person you are lol 
Sound-Intellect	Specific areas where teachers go to have fun and relax. The last thing I would want is for a student to turn up there and ruin my fun.
Sound-Intellect	lol. We all need our own space I guess.
Sound-Intellect	That's just our nature. As humans we have many limitations. Even when a human being reaches their full capacity and potential they will still be fallible and will continue to make mistakes. No getting away from that I am afraid.

Radical_Lightman	Stop being a cuck!  You'd save yourself a lot of headache if you stopped second guessing the Republicans. Everything our Emperor does is for the freedom and prosperity of the new republic.
Radical_Lightman	I'm sorry but that's wrong, Title IX is a comprehensive federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
Radical_Lightman	Females tend to do better than males in almost every sector of education, so that point seems a little disingenuous.
Radical_Lightman	A strawman argument? I didn't reply because you proved my point for me, and I'm hoping discerning readers will see for themselves how circular this logic is.

Radical_Lightman	I haven't even played it yet, but it's one of the most critically acclaimed games of last year. The first one was an excellent shooter which was also a critical & commercial success, so you're objectively wrong on all accounts.
Radical_Lightman	It's shocking and terrifying to me that there's people like /u/Nate_W who are clearly democratic & liberal who are trying to make excuses for the DNC at this point. Where's the fucking anger?! We literally have the DNC to blame for Trump, and DNC apologists are coming out of the woodwork to blame third party voters who probably would have put Bernie Sanders in the white house.

futurefamous425	He basically reacted how you'd expect if he had a camera (he wasn't vlogging at the time) I was genuinely shocked due to how random it was so when he walked by my table all I could as was "are you Casey Niestat?" Then he gave me that little hand wave and said "yea hey dude". He was grabbing deserts in the lounge with Candice and her parents and Francine but I only talked to Casey. Then when he was alone again I went up and asked for his autograph and he was really cool about it. I didn't have any reason to suspect that I fucked up until after when I got back to my hotel room and saw what happened to Candice's parents house. 
futurefamous425	I didn't have the opportunity to have a conversation with him but I got to say hi and get his autograph. Personality wise it seemed like he walked straight out of the vlogs. He seemed totally used to people recognizing him, just maybe a little annoyed someone recognized him at Disney. I'm not sure though 
futurefamous425	I just met Casey | I just saw Casey at Disney land and I got so excited I just had to say hi and ask for an autograph. I didn't even stop to think about what he and his family must be going through after the flood so looking back on it I feel like a total tool.   On the off chance that Casey visits this subreddit I just gotta say I'm sorry to bother you while you're on vacation with your family during this difficult time.

bio7	What I find especially amusing about it was that he closed his glove at about the  correct time. 
bio7	He played it off so perfectly that he closed his glove right as the ball was about the height of his glove, just 20 feet behind him.
bio7	There's no point to the 10 day DL during September. 
bio7	Because humans have perfect vision and spacial awareness at all times and have instantaneous reaction times, they always pinpoint the exact moment and location the white blur crosses the 3D volume of the strikezone before it reaches the catcher's glove. Hmmmmmm.
bio7	No there isn't. The 10-day is for making space on the 25-man roster, which is already expanded to the 40 in September. Zero purpose for the 10-day in September.
bio7	Why should it matter that it happened in a close division game? An umpire obviously doesn't choose where he makes his bad calls. And just like in every other instance of a very bad ball call, there was missed location/atrocious catcher glove movement involved. You're overreacting something awful.
bio7	Yes, but they can pull them straight out of the zone, which is what happened here.  [Here is another more egregious example.](https://streamable.com/7vyx)   Edit: sweet downvotes. Stay mad lol
bio7	Tony Watson recently threw an inning using only 1 baseball. Can't remember which game it was though.
bio7	The great thing about it is that you can drop it and pick it back up at any time. Each episode is a blast in a different way. Glad you got a taste of it already. :)

bio7	0/10, 10 K's. He's had a rough go.
bio7	Of course they fucking care.
bio7	4.27 SIERA is not dominant. At all.
bio7	I wouldn't be so sure. Pitching talent changes suddenly for pitchers, and nothing about his command or stuff has changed in a positive way this season despite what Orel claims.  And I'm not sure why you think his combined FB/GB is a good thing. He's a flyball pitcher that doesn't have an elite K% - BB% profile. That screams average reliever.
bio7	He's actually been worse this year if you look at the important reliever numbers like FIP. ERA is a mirage.

bio7	>Hurricanes are serious things but life is so much better when experienced with a sense of humor.  I mean what was I supposed to think? Why else would this person mention having a sense of humor about this?
bio7	First off, I never once said that this whole thing offends me personally. I live in California and do not know anyone affected by these tragedies. I was simply defending the people who *were* offended from the original comment.   Why do you not think I'm right about that? And why are you acting like being offended is something people consciously choose to do? If you make fun of me for my messed up ears, I'm not "just being sensitive" if I tell you you're an asshole and to go fuck yourself. It's a natural reaction to people targeting vulnerability. 
bio7	Commando is far more efficient than SWAT. It's not even close.
bio7	Yes he did, and I think that's a great comparison. I think Buehler's delivery is a tad bit smoother at release, but yeah good call.  Edit: Lol even this is getting downvoted. Good shit /r/baseball.
bio7	>That really sucks, and I'm sorry you haven't had the best time with the game. It's kind of surprising to me that this one thing was the deal-breaker for your group, though.  I doubt it was the deal-breaker. It was probably a culmination of several perceived poor design decisions, with the autorage being the deciding factor. 
bio7	If your sense of humor consists of making light of people's lives being ruined, you don't care about those people. Does that answer your question?
bio7	And I'm sure that song at that baseball game hurt some people. Yes it's a small thing that doesn't matter much, but it was completely avoidable and it did bother a lot of people. It's not your place to shut down the people it bothered, nor is it an appropriate place to get on a soap box and shout about people being offended.   There's no "logical discourse" you can possibly make that would deny those people their right to feel what they feel. "It's just a joke" is a horrible excuse for insensitivity, no matter what the context it is.
bio7	Who made you the supreme arbiter of what things people are allowed to be offended by? People's lives are going to be ruined. Nothing about that is fucking funny. Just because you can shut the caring side of your brain off doesn't mean everyone else has to.
bio7	Tap jump for shine bair/dair is easier and faster than using x/y, so it's a good habit.
bio7	On the contrary, it is great fun.
bio7	That's great, but you won't be getting quarterpounders otherwise. CD is pretty much the greatest thing to ever happen to KF2's HoE scene, so I hope you eventually try it out. It's just like regular KF2 except you can make it as easy, hard or vanilla as you like. 
bio7	You can use Controlled Difficulty to set a spawn cycle to introduce quarterpounders into the regular waves.
bio7	Definitely the build of choice for big zed slaying. The GS spx is just brutally overpowered during zed time. With a competent commando, you can take out triple fp and a side order of 4 scrakes before they touch the camp.  You can also sub one of the deagles out for a 1911 if you're expected to kill a lot of trash, which can happen a lot in pubs. 
bio7	Does what make me happy?
bio7	Way to stretch the truth to support your side. 8 inches? Fucking lol.
bio7	So express it using meaningful statistics so we can tell how good Bauer actually was? The Indians are a very good baseball team, so him having 15 wins tells me almost nothing about Bauer as a pitcher.
bio7	Sort of? I'd take Avilan's numbers any day of the week. He's not trash by any stretch of the imagination. 
bio7	Avilan is not trash. ERA, FIP, xFIP are all fantastic this year.
bio7	That is absolutely incredible. How often does that even happen? Even in perfectos you still get a fair number of flyouts, right?
bio7	And I believe Joe and Orel were exaggerating to attempt to explain the improved results despite the worse FIP/xFIP.   Edit:   Slider% 2015-2017: 15.8, 12.5, 17.3.  I'd hardly consider that to be introducing a new pitch.
bio7	I'm not sure where you're getting the idea he debuted his slider this year. He has had it for at least 3 years. 
bio7	Torey Lovullo is the manager of the DBacks.
bio7	We usually refer to the perk bonus choices as  "skills" or "talents" as it is a bit confusing and awkward to refer to both as just perks. Gunslinger is a **perk**, Quick Draw is a perk **skill** or perk **talent**. This is just a result of working with TWI's original nomenclature in KF1, where Perks were all that existed.  So as the Gunslinger perk, I choose the following skills:  Quick Draw, Rack 'em Up, Speed-loader, Skullcracker, Fan Fire  As Support:  Tactical Reload, Salvo, Tight Choke, Resupply Pack/Concussive Rounds (depends), Barrage.  As Medic: All left.  Commando skills depend on what my precise role is. Extending ZT is *always* the primary role of a commando (aside from killing trash), but depending on who is in the lane with me I may be expected to help kill scrakes and/or fleshpounds.   For level 5, High Capacity Mags is my usual choice, but Tactical Reload isn't bad by any means, especially early on. For 10, Fallback is the choice for when you want maximal ZT-extending ability and aren't expected to solo scrakes (you can still help out), otherwise Impact Rounds. 15 is Tenacious for the most part, as Commando has more than enough ammo to last through the wave without Prepared. 20 is almost always Hollow Point Rounds, it's just so damn powerful and makes recoil trivial to control. Eat Lead *does* have a place for when you're not expected to touch large zeds, but in really strong teams you're rarely caught in a situation where the extra ammo is the difference between getting a ZT extension, and running out of ammo + being unable to switch to another weapon. 25 is Machine Gunner, as it allows you to mow down scrakes in ZT while still assisting in extending. Tactician is also a strong option, but it's pretty damn rare when you're caught in the situation I just mentioned, out of ammo with everything.  Edit: added a bit of info
bio7	This type of combo has been around a long time. Mango is very consistent at it. Nothing to lose your shit over.
bio7	No other perk makes playing the game a pain like firebug does. Commando, SWAT, Sharpshooter, Gunslinger, some Survivalist builds, and even medic/support all get hindered by firebugs to some degree. It seems like you're the one getting defensive and need to chill. These are core gameplay design issues that have been discussed since KF1. Stop accusing people of having baseless grudges without addressing the actual issues.   Edit: I forgot about Berserker which can also causes similar issues with disrupting aim, but it isn't nearly as bad as firebug in this respect.
bio7	It would be really funny if that gif of the running horse slowly faded in while Puig was running around the bases.
bio7	You're looking up the wrong stats. "Runners left in scoring position per game" is a bad way to evaluate RISP performance. Productive outs are vastly overrated and not related to RISP.   It's easy. Go to fangraphs. Team stats. Splits. Check wRC+ with RISP. See that the Dodgers are among the best in the game.
bio7	Are neither of them going to acknowledge you or what?
bio7	You are 100% wrong, as nenright said. Every fan of every team says this whenever they have a bad game. Look at the stats before you make claims like that, seriously. It's not hard.  You know what's better than a productive out? Not making an out, which is what the Dodgers do so unbelievably well.
bio7	The guy lost a child. He'll be fine.
bio7	These kinds of games just happen. The team has been very good in the clutch all season long, don't act like it's a chronic problem. It's the opposite.  The timing couldn't possibly have been any worse, but damn it's not like the offense didn't come close to coming through.
bio7	I honestly don't expect that to last. Turner was awful against lefties last year, now he's absolutely crushing them. Puig's a different player, but he was good against lefties as recently as last year.
bio7	You aren't alone, bud. And to make matters worse, if you get a curious individual who wants to understand what the fuck you're talking about, you need to go through layers upon layers of explanation, all of which requires careful thought to deliver in understandable terms.   It's mostly just a lost cause, especially when alcohol is involved.
bio7	He's my absolute favorite.
bio7	Oldish glitch. Happens frequently on Volter Manor. I think it has something to do with zeds in vents not counting as alive until they come out or something, then the wave ends when the counter is above 0. Not sure though, never bothered to test it or look it up.
bio7	Don't think so, but it's at 96% right now, so not much.
bio7	Vin should call a game with Joe Davis if the Dodgers are going for win 117. Dream.
bio7	Shit, I think I accidently downvoted you earlier. I just came back to this thread to see you downvoted. Fixed. 
bio7	No, probably not.
bio7	You know you can look deeper than a team's record, right?
bio7	34-11 or its a failed season tbh.
bio7	>Encouraged by the bullpen work today. Fields and Baez with GooseEggs and Avilan pitching out of lead-off double.    Yessss goose eggs!
bio7	Joc has never had good defensive numbers, but they're especially bad this year.
bio7	He's indirectly but quite obviously assuming/accusing a good friend of mine of being an aimbotter. Of course I'm going to be a bit upset about it.
bio7	It really is. There are soooo many amazing players out there who are comparable to Fat Cat, and this guy thinks they all aimbot? Lol.
bio7	My tag is Trance. I have not played with G Sting but I have played a lot with dandyboy66 and devante, so I learned about his channel from them.
bio7	Then I owe you an honest apology. I thought I had, really. Not off my rocker in general though.  Crutches? What?
bio7	Whatever, you're exactly the same as every other ignorant wingnut who believes Fat Cat is a rabid cheater. You all blend into one for me.  Although honestly I think I was just too tired to set you straight the last time I saw you braying incoherently about this shit.
bio7	I've had run-ins with this dude before. If you can't see the passive-aggressive attitude underlying this whole post, then I have nothing to say to you.
bio7	Fat Cat, Kore, dandyboy66, mike5879, Nam, yuyuka, G Sting, myself. All 100% legit.   Unfortunately your head is so far up your own ass you'd never accept that though. If you youtube search "KF2 Aimbot" you'll find examples of actual aimbots that, *surprise surprise* do not resemble any of the aforementioned players' gameplay in the slightest.  Try harder, scrub.
bio7	Hah, how about no?
bio7	That's good. You should trust monkey, he's another example of an exceedingly skilled player who I've been good friends with and played with for a long time. Good choice!
bio7	>It's just.. You know when you get grabbed and your view jumps over to the zed's head suddenly? That's what his gameplay looks like all the time, except he isn't getting grabbed.  It's called being good at the fucking game.
bio7	They'd be wrong. Aimbotting is incredibly obvious, and Fat Cat is thus incredibly obviously NOT an aimbotter.
bio7	This whole thread is a passive-aggressive shot at Fat Cat. OP's level of ignorance is profound.
bio7	You seem to be gravely mistaken. Fat Cat is not a cheater, I too have played countless games with him, and he has consistently good aim that isn't the slightest bit suspicious. The type of aim you're referring to is also known as *good aim*, or *being good at the game*.   Fat Cat has probably the best planning and decision-making in the game, and you can't "cheat" that. It goes hand-in-hand with aiming skill. 
bio7	Nah, he's really not. Passed balls aren't as big a deal as you'd think, considering that it's only a few over the league average per year. He's been the second-best hitting catcher over the past three years behind Posey. His framing has been so good and consistent that it has added massive, MVP-level value to the team, and it hasn't really declined either. He also has a strong arm, which Barnes lacks.   His game-calling isn't the best, but ultimately it doesn't matter as much as the other stuff, and I really like his emphasis on high fastballs. 
bio7	Toxic homophobic piece of shit. I hope you get banned and never show your disgusting face around this community ever again.
bio7	You're just assuming he does and trying to make it seem like everyone should believe it too. It's toxic as fuck.
bio7	Homophobic shithead.

bio7	People can say whatever they want, but people shouldn't say things that hurt others. This should be a basic, obvious human principle that supersedes something as nebulous and vague as "free speech". 
bio7	Free speech, *of course*! WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT!?
bio7	>No ones attacking anyone.  [Yeah, you're totally in a position to be saying anything like that.](http://imgur.com/MAPbNl8)  How about no. 
bio7	Guess people should just stop being offended altogether to allow people like you to say whatever you want to whoever you want with no social repercussions then.   This mindset is digusting. I was born with slightly deformed ears. It doesn't make me feel good when people comment on them, and even as an adult I still hear about them. It doesn't make people feel good when you're a fucked up piece of shit to them. So here's a solution: shut the fuck up and learn to be a decent human being. You don't get to decide how I should feel when I get insulted for my appearance.  How fucking hard is it to not be an asshole? People like you care more about being able to shame and use slurs without caring than about how your fellow humans feel about it. It's fucking disgusting.
bio7	That's actually a great way of looking at it, lmao.
bio7	DBacks are definitely a great team. Good at every aspect of the game, but it just seems like the Dodgers are just a bit better at everything except maybe baserunning. Great teams, great games, great series.
bio7	You definitely should have. You're right about that, of course, but your wording was highly misleading in the original.  "No electronic communication devices are allowed in the dugout."
bio7	He's been worse than Barnes this year, funnily enough. Only slightly though.

MMMLG	Some people complained that they didn't throw a caution when Truex hit the wall. That was a throwback too! From a time when to get a yellow flag you needed expressions like "*inferno*", "*apocalypse*", or "*landed on the parking lot*" to describe a wreck.
MMMLG	I must confess, deep inside I *kinda* wanted a Ganassi car to win, just to see Chip going on a rampage.
MMMLG	What in the name of all fucks happened to Rutledge?? 😳 
Gorion79-	You're $3 short when you go to pay for your items at the store. The cashier foots you the remaining balance. How would (or would you) repay their kindness? | 
Gorion79-	It was at a dollar store. 
Gorion79-	What are some good ways for dogs with a lot of missing teeth to eat? | [removed]
Gorion79-	What are some ways you've found to help stay awake during daily long (~1 hour) commutes, barring drinking caffeinated beverages? | 
Gorion79-	Don't watch/read any guides on the game. The feeling of completing a level, and proceeding to facepalm by virtue of not seeing the simple solution right in your  face, is amazing. 
Gorion79-	What are some ways you expedite your morning routine prior to work/school? | 
Gorion79-	I do need to finish the game. I was excited to play it namely because of how much others were singing its praise, but found myself burned out rather quick. 
Gorion79-	Some sort of job at a morgue/graveyard/cemetery, a hitman, or a stay at home job, where you're just entering data in, having your own business where you make it so human interaction is very limited, are a few.
Gorion79-	During a cross country race, one of the parents runs in front of their kid to help motivate them to finish. The kid ends up winning the race. How should be addressed, in terms of cheating? | 
Gorion79-	Hearing someone say something I am reluctant to say.
Gorion79-	The jobs that entail performing routine maintenance on these automated machines.
Gorion79-	I notice what you described when someone else is using my Rift, but not when I am using it.
Gorion79-	Bubby Jack. | 
Gorion79-	I was fairly new to driving at the time and driving over an icy bridge. Didn't slow down long enough and had to make a wider turn than expected. In slow motion it felt like, slid my car into the guard rails. A couple of people with chains and a truck pulled over and pulled me out of the snow. That is the most kind thing I can think of a stranger has done for me.
Gorion79-	We found him under the house as a newborn. Covered in bugs and rain. His mom abandoned him and his 2 other (that we know of) littermates. They sadly didn't make it far into the bottle feeding, but Bubby did, and he's so funny. I've never raised a creature from birth, so it's definitely rewarding. 
Gorion79-	Advice for setup of Oculus Sensors in very limited desk space? | I indeed have a very limited desk space and play space currently, but I wish to enjoy my a Rift a bit for the time being, outside of seated Experiences. I pretty much have to move things around my desk, to allow for space of the Sensors. During the calibration setup process, I recall it mentioning the Sensors shouldn't be more than 3 feet apart. I was able to put the Sensors where I would put my PC speakers, but it's a pain, because it's already such a cord hell in that area on my small desk. 
Gorion79-	I don't really feel that way at all. Achievements have always existed in some form or another (if only in the mind, and among people who play the game). The fact that many games have them officially, and a picture/text to go along with them, I don't believe, in any way ruins any game. If anything, it pushes you to try things in a game you wouldn't have otherwise tried. A game's worth, to me, lies in the enjoyment you receive from it. Achievements don't take that away at all.
Gorion79-	Definitely a valuable website; if only it counted words too, instead of only lines and characters. 
Gorion79-	My first car. Enabled me to be able to get to work, to attain more money to buy other things I have enjoyed, such as my gaming PC, and support myself. Two very good feelings: working for something you desire, and attaining such desire as a result of your hard work. 
Gorion79-	Hard to say. I would be an entirely different person, unless you mean I am just as I am now, but I am teleported back to a computerless world. I'm sure I would get by in some way. I think back then people communicated vastly more in person (not necessarily a good or bad thing in and of itself), so I'd do that, or play non electronic games to pass the time and exercise more without the distraction of the all alluring computer. It really is a bizarre question. I mean, I could ask, what would people do in the future, but in current times, without whatever amazing technology they have in comparison to what we have now. 
Gorion79-	Diablo 2, I have spent the most years playing, out of all the games I've spent time on. I don't think I will ever find another video game I will be as addicted to ever again, being that there's such a plethora of choices and availability of video games. that sticking with 1 for a long time is difficult these days.

bullsaint	Hello /r/cooking, what's for dinner? | 
bullsaint	Hello Reddit, what's for dinner? | 
bullsaint	Solid answer.
bullsaint	Who's playing?
bullsaint	So far it is more like Terarria, or a 2-d minecraft. I just got to my first planet and it's all mining and base building. It does have a multi-player element so you can have friends play with you, and explore with you. I'm thoroughly enjoying it, though.   I own FTL and I can account for the numerous hours trying to beat it. Though it can be beat, my friend put it best, "You can't really beat it, you just get better at losing." And losing is fun. 
bullsaint	I ended up getting this. So far really fun! (poor Earth!)
bullsaint	I was actually gifted a copy of FTL a while back. He described it as "A game where you really can't beat it, you just get better at losing."   Losing has never been more fun!
bullsaint	Ended up getting StarBound. So far it's pretty fun!
bullsaint	This sort of reminds me of Myst or Riven. Looks interesting! 
bullsaint	I already have New Vegas but no the Wild Wasteland Park DLC. I'll have to check that out. Thanks!
bullsaint	This looks promising! How much actual space flight is there?
bullsaint	If I find one, I'll shoot you a msg!

Looking for a game that has the feel of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. | Open world and exploration without the need for pesky co-op would be preferable.

bullsaint	What are some of the ways you've realized you've grown as a person? | 
bullsaint	[WP]You are the head of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and you've detected an alien armada heading for Earth. You tried to tell the government, but no one believes you.

bullsaint	Technically, at the end she didn't need to pull back so hard. She just needed to roll her shoulders back if she was in a good rear naked choke position. 
bullsaint	Though I am an advocate for science and facts, the March for Science just seems to be a contest to see who can be the most culturally relevant. | 
bullsaint	[WP] You are the last Human leaving Earth after a mass relocation of Humans elsewhere. Give the story of your literal last day on Earth. | 
bullsaint	In honor of Earth Day, what sort of send off would you give our blue marble if you were the last one left once we all move to Mars? |

Redditor_2017	The Jak and Daxter series had a lot of them. But the hardest for me was in Jak III. The mission was where I had to go out into the desert and collect all the artifacts. 
Redditor_2017	Settlers of Catan.
Redditor_2017	For me Jak III was the easiest. Besides a couple of missions. Jak and Daxter was Normal difficulty while Jak II was the hardest.

Ditario	Ka-jiga!
Ditario	You'd be surprised how much a man actually cares about his favorite chair.
Ditario	I'm Moista than an Oysta.
Ditario	They said the same thing about Lord of the Rings.   They could make 2 movies per season and it'd work. The seasons themselves are 6 hours so putting them into 4 or even 5 via 2 movies could happen.
Ditario	I'm blue cause i'm in need of a diet...
Ditario	Great Memories with my Father. That Star Wars game was the tits. Don't remember what the name of it was.
Ditario	Being an asshole is respected. Being a dick is what people tend to stray away from.  Be an asshole. Don't be a dick.
Ditario	Considering how passionate OP is about this, I am gonna go with a no.
Ditario	The people who call it "justice" does not actually make it "justice" because they FEEL like it is. 
Ditario	You're not wrong, dude. Plenty of us reading are aware and agree - but it's just not the right website to argue this. It's pointless.
Ditario	In the Navy - my watch every day is 12 hours/7 days a week underway.
Ditario	Or you can play Horizon Zero Dawn for a much more factual and accurate representation of the future....
Ditario	You got a factual reply. You're refusing to comprehend it.
Ditario	What is the summary of this? - I can't watch youtube where I am at right now.
Ditario	That's not how her hamster and how society will view it. I don't disagree with you in our judgement of her, but she will have "predicted" how bad it was with him and how bad he is and once he finally hits her now all of those assumptions are proven correct.
Ditario	And give her justification for her actions?
Ditario	It wouldn't be income but you have to view it in the classical sense of a "ledger"  yes you are having in credit to your ledger account by debiting your savings account. So you will still see an "income" into your checking account when you add that savings.   You will also add that income to the same classification as the tire. So the variance will disappear and like you said - it will cancel out for your budgeting.  Hope this helps.
Ditario	I think he is referencing how they are Liberals that do not know how to come to any conclusion and wait till Sunday before talking about a subject because John Oliver will tell them (literally) how to interpret an event and feel about it.
Ditario	So I know a bunch of dudes who are taking pills right now because it doesn't pop as easily on military pee and blood tests. I've been asking around for about 4-5 months now, wondering if there is any alternative that won't stop your own natural process.  My friends who do it have all explicitly told me that once you start you can't stop. 
Ditario	To all of us who are in 7th Fleet - You know why stuff like this is happening. We just aren't allowed to say why. Command Climate Surveys can come and go and it still won't change. It's a shame and truly unfortunate that casualties like this are the only way for things to get changed.  Fuck. 
Ditario	>but every sailor there was miserable with the exception of those trying to accelerate their career by serving in a high op-tempo environment.   Logged in just to say this is spot on down in Sasebo. It's unfortunate. So much good can come from your career if you're hungry. Seriously, I am doing extremely well, but my friends and fellow Shipmates are STRUGGLING. STRUGGLLLINGGG. That's all I'm willing to post on the matter.  
Ditario	Doing surveys at the end of Bootcamp of a booter's experience getting yelled at and how they felt about it would be a great place to start looking.
Ditario	So to clarify, we can still submit and have lots of screenshots of twitter - just not direct links?
Ditario	What is the criteria?
Ditario	It is because according to the news just being a Trump supporter was the definition. I thought it had changed. Like what Nazi referred to. it used to refer to National Socialists but now it's just anyone who happened to be defending the historical accomplishments of Robert. E. Lee and ignoring the facts and his accolades leading to him being invited to be a commander for the Union.
Ditario	Are you seriously trying to strawman this to compare the time period of the statue/pyramid *instead* of the means and ideologies associated with their uprising in the first place? 
Ditario	Let's get rid of the pyramids then.
Ditario	Only know this because of Monkey Island.
Ditario	Stop. It's way easier for people to just accuse other people of being nazis and not look in the mirror.
Ditario	I am more of a "Absolutely. Should I not?" and nip that in the butt right there kind of guy. Although, you can play some games after..."Hmmmmm now that I am thinking about that...I don't know......there are a LOT of things wrong with you!" (much better done in person, don't waste time texting.)
Ditario	It's been 5 min. Anything yet?
Ditario	You did the right thing. However if you're still talking to her without her making up (financially) for her actions then you're doing the wrong thing.   She pays you back (somehow) or you don't talk to her. There are tons of 9s out there. 
Ditario	It will only show for transactions from added Investment accounts.  If you have added like an account from Schwab or Fidelity and have deposited money into it and then Bought or Sold any financials with it, those transactions will show up there and you can re assign them as buys or sells.
Ditario	> But it raises the possibility they **could** have hacked the company that makes them and inserted software that **may** have then been loaded into the voting machines. Or from their hacking into voter registration rolls, **could** have removed people from the rolls. So somebody goes to vote, isn't on the roll and has to cast a provisional ballot. Those ballots are supposed to be counted later, but are usually not counted for various reasons.  >So "directly didn't change votes" is still technically true, but they very well **may** have indirectly affected the vote by messing with voter rolls and **maybe** the actual software on the voting machines if they hacked into the system and updated software which was later loaded on to those machines.  -  >Could, Maybes, & Mays  So basically a whole lot of smoke.
Ditario	The essence of professional sports IRL.
Ditario	> I'm in NO way justifying any of these jackasses  - >Every other sentence is justifying all of the jackasses 
Ditario	It's amazing you can see that with your head in the sand.
Ditario	At least he didn't bow to them.  (I'm referring to getting off the plane at the first introduction. Not after receiving a damn award.)  http://www.snopes.com/2017/05/22/bow-saudi-arabia/
Ditario	Then you acknowledge that to say "We're trying" as the person above me said, is flat out not true.
Ditario	Just make a Twitter account and you'll be good. 
Ditario	Sasebo right now. Sitting in Sushi Ro. Can confirm. The struggle is super real. Would rather be back on a ship in Norfolk. 
Ditario	A minority is. The rest are just in "We'll deal with it" mode or very happy with him.
Ditario	Wait, you don't think people who have been unjustly fired with THIS administration won't say so? 
Ditario	Have you seen his Twitter posts? The dude was a die hard Bernie supporter and if anything a libertarian. 
Ditario	It's much easier for all of us to ignore what people say and just move on with our Narrative. 
Ditario	...dude, what?
Ditario	No - that you projecting your racism on his adverb. 
Ditario	You mean to virtue signal unity. Not actually be unified.
Ditario	Got it. Thank you for clarifying.
Ditario	When you're stupid enough to believe that the press is what brought down Nixon and not the actual investigation and him stepping down on his own accord before the investigation found out he was guilty.
Ditario	Curious - how is it not a violation of their right?   I should not be harmed(physically) or charged (criminally) for saying whatever I want to say.   Is that not true?  Not talking about Social Consequences.
Ditario	When it comes to proving something this serious, you need a bit more than just hearsay.
Ditario	>He was intentionally talked about common threats, and accidentally revealed intelligence he shouldn't have.  "Sources say"
Ditario	Love that feeling! Way to go!
Ditario	This does not give this game any justice at all. 
Ditario	That was the point to the original guy. I had no bar to live up to - was just trying to help you hold your end of your deal. 
Ditario	Looks like society doesn't agree with you.
Ditario	I made a mistake in thinking you could critically think for yourself. I'm not that other guy btw.
Ditario	It is them joking around. But Reddit wants so badly for Trump to be seen in a bad light. 
Ditario	Man - seeing some of those names. Good times. Those were some dedicated posters and content creators back then. 
Ditario	Why should it be easy?
Ditario	Please delete your account. Here's why.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_neutrality
Ditario	This song got me through college way back when. 
Ditario	Exactly which is why people criticizing Trumps Comments are dumb. OPSEC is OPSEC, of course not telling someone always is better than telling them, but no crime or violation happened today. 
Ditario	How dare you.
Ditario	Glad to see you back, brotha.
Ditario	So there is zero evidence to any of this, just a lack of response from different requests for answers. Usually Snopes links to other articles and other sources. Very disappointing. 
Ditario	On the sources part of it. I read a few of them. (Buzzfeed and the NBC one) They aren't sources. The whole point of snopes is to go further than the articles that are  put out and get to the actual evidence itself. 
Ditario	What debunking?
Ditario	No. That's "progressive. "
Ditario	Whatever mental gymnastics you need to play. Go for it. It's a crime. 
Ditario	What was the point of that screenshot? You making an issue out of something that isn't a issue doesn't make it valid.   Like throwing "tribalism"?  Also wasnt the woman at the end who hit on Aloy an Oserem? How was she in charge of the defenses but was not supposed to?  I don't care what % is male or female. If you're counting that I'm sure there I'd female privilege in who is dying more? It's dumb to create social issues when there weren't any.   Same if there was racism it would not have sold.   
Ditario	Nice strawman attempt    Is that what I said? Better yet, was that at all my original point?  The answer is no.   Also let's just play with the fact that the game held a woman to be the end all be all solution provider to life on the planet AND the main protagonist was a woman who saves the entire world.   There was a female war chief, etc.   I would not have bought the game if there was blatant racism in it.   My op still stands. 
Ditario	You all creating one in game doesn't mean that one actually exists in a fictional game.   See also: attention seeker. 
Ditario	There was not heaps of racism in the game. Other Social Issues I don't see as social issues. 
Ditario	Unfortunately the truth is because the game wouldn't sell. I know I don't think I would have bought it. 
Ditario	>than an insane person who has no respect for any institution and a complete ignorance of nearly every topic.  The Hyperbole.
Ditario	Continue spreading the word.   #WE WILL VINDICATE YOU SETH RICH!
Ditario	>The WaPo story has been independently verified by several other sources.  No it hasn't. There is ZERO evidence other than hearsay.   HOWEVER, there is a person who was THERE on the RECORD stating the opposite. 
Ditario	The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.   I can not believe I'm having to explain this.
Ditario	Your **opinion** of what they are trying to accomplish does not make it a fact of what they are actually doing.   I'm "basically" believing a person who was in the room, on the record stating something VS an nameless source.  To which you'd(a person critical of my position) rather go with the nameless source because you just don't like the guy.
Ditario	I prefer the word adorable.   >Deep down, you know he's a moron. You just don't want to be wrong on the decades of liberals calling you uninformed. It's ok bud. I'll be here for you one day when you make that pivot.   You had to make an edit to add all of that? 
Ditario	>Because this administration has a great history on telling the truth? Did you miss everything last week where Trump contradicted the WH talking points because he's a moron? It's not far off the truth that he's dumb enough to do this.   This doesn't make what I said wrong, or McMaster a liar. Basically you have nothing to say other than "Well he could be lying!!" but you're stating just conjecture and not fact.     >I rest my case.  [Some things never change.](https://pics.me.me/hmmm-i-need-a-good-rebuttal-aha-looks-like-you-19583636.png)
Ditario	Interesting way to describe people that simply disagree with you.
Ditario	>Nothing he says contradicts the WaPo story.  Except the part where he said....  > The story that came out tonight as reported is false  
Ditario	Short answer? - **Possibly** -  depending on the context. If the news had been trying to get her constantly impeached reporting the pettiest of stuff and then this came out in addition to it - Yes I would believe McMaster as fact.   It takes a lot to impeach a president. Obama even shared stuff with Russa.   Fair question to get at. If this was the first thing to come out about Hillary in an alternate universe I do believe I'd be just as crazed about this as others are on the other end of the political spectrum.  
Ditario	He was pretty clear. You choosing to rationalize it or Washington Post trying to salvage all that they lost today doesn't make it false.  Here is what he said since it's apparent not everyone has watched the statement:  >LT. GEN. H.R. McMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I have a brief statement for the record. There is nothing that the president takes more seriously than the security of the American people. The story that came out tonight as reported is false. The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation.  >**At no time, at no time, where intelligent sources or methods discussed. And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. Two other senior officials who were present, including the Secretary of the State, remember the meeting the same way and have said so. Their on the record accounts should outweigh anonymous sources. I was in the room. It didn't happen.**  It doesn't get any clearer. 
Ditario	Solid read. I'm further behind you on this journey so I appreciate you posting. No criticism here.  
Ditario	Up until recently most of Reddit thought we were all bots so I mean it's progress that you believe I was a person. 
Ditario	If someone has taken the time to expand all of my "comment is below threshold" comments down to here, I'm sure they can watch the video for themselves.  Anonymous story versus three cited witnesses contradicting it?   It's a blatant denial. The story as it was reported is not true. Period.   >Or how about the aspect that the folks in the room had to damage control and the folks in the NSA and CIA leaked this?  Come on man, you can do all the mental gymnastics you want.   McMaster said "It did not happen" I really don't know what more you could want.   I used to be a mod at the T_D back during the election. I don't post there much anymore since we won.
Ditario	Just stop.  [How about someone who was in the room that's not an anonymous source?](https://youtu.be/sjizB6IL1ok)
Ditario	Because it's not true.   [It was literally just denied on television.](https://youtu.be/sjizB6IL1ok)   This story is made up.   "How many times does the Washington Post need to be proven wrong before people stop repeating their anonymously sourced assertions as fact?"  edit - added link.
Ditario	As you can clearly see, you are so desperate right now you are using hyperbole to prove your point. You not only don't know what Obama campaigned about and also Trump that you've chosen to jump to insults.   Let that sink in. 
Ditario	>I know what my candidate's policies were.   Evidently not.  
Ditario	Pot calling the Kettle Black. Typical.
Ditario	Ok. Show me evidence of your argument with Trump since you are on this bastion of truth and righteousness. 
Ditario	Or I'm in the military and just logged back on to a device that I can actually spend more than 3 minutes browsing. You realizing you're wrong is on the bottom of my list of priorities. 
Ditario	>Obama didn't publicly rail against their predecessors for doing business with the Saudis.  What's embarrassing is you think that Obama didn't rail on bush for doing business with the Saudis.
Ditario	> You said that Nye didn't understand the scientific method and thus was not a scientist.   I never said this.
Ditario	That's dumb and borderline hyperbole.  If Gordon Ramsey has his shows does that not make him a Chef?  Is the Waiter who serves Gordon's food (who knows how it was cooked, what it tastes like so he can sell the food to clients) a Chef?  The answer is no. He is still a Waiter. No matter how much he studies or works with the food. He is not a Chef.  *Edit - looking at the other comments, you have been editing your posts so I'm done for now*

pazimpanet	This made me imagine shittily drawn pictures of dexter and DeeDee with water melon sized boobs arguing in court while a judge grants her 50% of his lab and inventions.
pazimpanet	"She's real, but last week she died."  Bo Burnham- lower your expectations
pazimpanet	Interesting, I've tried both and come to the exact opposite conclusion. Also, on the list of places that I would like to repeatedly stick my hand, a dark toilet bowl with a fresh poop in it is very very low on the list. 
pazimpanet	Boat fuel.
pazimpanet	Ten.
pazimpanet	People die in car crashes every day.
pazimpanet	Yeah, and he wouldn't have made them taste so good!
pazimpanet	3:30 AM on Christmas Eve.
pazimpanet	They also pay significantly less towards their militaries and less towards education per student. We aren't talking about those governments. We're talking about the American government which takes massive amounts of money and flushes it down the toilet.
pazimpanet	When was that? 
pazimpanet	But not in that order.
pazimpanet	[I've always thought Rosario Dawson](http://cdn.bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Rosario-Dawson-Sin-City.jpg)
pazimpanet	You're worried about dog poo? Those kids shit in their pants
pazimpanet	I love the image of some over the top "tough-guy" man child working at Disney world. Is it hard to intimidate people while wearing Mickey Mouse ears? 
pazimpanet	Go ask his family if it was worth it.
pazimpanet	No thanks. If they cut the portion sizes in half, the fatties would just order more (no source as I based this on absolutely nothing ). Meanwhile, my girlfriends and I wouldn't be able to have leftovers for lunch the next day anymore!   Also, you know that the restaurants would just see it as an opportunity to increase profits and you would be paying the same amount for less food. 
pazimpanet	Isn't this a plot to a Matt Damon movie?
pazimpanet	Those unexpected expenses would have come either way. Imagine where you would have been if you hadn't saved up an emergency fund.
pazimpanet	People be fuckin.
pazimpanet	Do you have a smart phone?
pazimpanet	Oh okay, that makes more sense
pazimpanet	Are you a cartoon character?
pazimpanet	If I learned anything from the few episodes of attack on Titan that I saw, this is not a viable long term solution.
pazimpanet	See Bob Saget 
pazimpanet	1v1 me Irma!!
pazimpanet	The 6 doesn't have this problem.
pazimpanet	**How does your government work?**  It doesn't.  "Here's your ballot."
pazimpanet	No, I meant to add that at the end but forgot. I was just venting about the Reddit circlejerk as a whole, that just manifested itself under your post. I know you were just talking about this specific image, no offense intended to you directly.
pazimpanet	And Apple does?
pazimpanet	The phone comes with a dongle. I know that that isn't ideal for many people, myself included, but that's why I won't buy it. Do we really need to keep beating this dead horse. We get it, you guys don't like a product, shut the fuck up about it and get a life you fucking fanboys.
pazimpanet	They're both ex hardcore rappers who did a 180.
pazimpanet	Or try to wipe it with a rag.
pazimpanet	A manager of a single bank branch is still pretty low on the totem pole.
pazimpanet	If somebody did that shit to me I would get every single detail about how horrible his life is now. I would pay his nurse or caretaker under the table to low key text me every time he poops himself just to brighten up my day. 
pazimpanet	The type of people without bank accounts are probably not flying or buying cars over $10K.
pazimpanet	And then there's Malcolm in the middle. They nailed it.
pazimpanet	That doesn't sound right to me, but they're always blurred in porn so I can't be sure
pazimpanet	Talk to me in twenty years.
pazimpanet	This is actually her saying that she isn't ugly, as if she was ugly then she wouldn't need to ask.
pazimpanet	No worries, i'm sure the dealer will just throw a few thousand more onto the asking price for the trouble....maybe 5 or 10 thousand just to be safe.
pazimpanet	It escalated like this in the US as well (although maybe not as fast). My dad and I went to the same university, one semester for me would have paid for his whole degree. Luckily I worked full time in my field all through college and spent my summers at the local community college so I was able to pay for more than half of my degree out of pocket and get some good experience.
pazimpanet	Community isn't on Netflix so I'm okay with this.
pazimpanet	Recently all my problems have been shitheads in priuses. There's something just a little extra infuriating about being cut off and almost hit by someone with a COEXIST bumper sticker. 
pazimpanet	Who?
pazimpanet	What about IUDs, condoms, and pulling out?
pazimpanet	It's more effective than letting him cum inside you....
pazimpanet	Exactly. Scott's Totts.
pazimpanet	I constantly remind my girlfriend of this. My dog is gorgeous. He wouldn't have made it through the day.
pazimpanet	It's more effective than letting him cum inside you....
pazimpanet	So you think that pulling out has a larger or equal chance of impregnating a girl as not pulling out because of Precum?
pazimpanet	Remind her that unless she makes three times more than you do, she fucked up.
pazimpanet	I have these too and they were literally life changing for me. I love them.
pazimpanet	Do you think that SIDS is named that because people hate infants?
pazimpanet	I mean, I bet the pope isn't eating ramen every night. There's lots of money in religion and always has been.
pazimpanet	No, obviously it's all about money and possessions.
pazimpanet	I acknowledged that it exists and I'm not surprised that you've experienced it multiple times in your mind considering you attribute everything to hate and refuse to consider any alternatives.
pazimpanet	Wow. You're worldview must be super fucking depressing.   I hope things get better for you. 
pazimpanet	I just don't like your name argument. It was a time with massive amounts of discrimination and hate, but to say that that name stems entirely or even primarily from that hate is a little harder for me to believe. Look how long it's taking to squash the vaccines cause autism people today, I'd say a year turn around is pretty good.  "Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity."  -Hanlon's razor 
pazimpanet	After eating a "mentos" that Bill Cosby left in the glove box?
pazimpanet	"Cut that ivory into skinny pieces, Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby."
pazimpanet	I say this to my dog almost daily.
pazimpanet	Tell me your friend paid to fix it at least
pazimpanet	The IT guy at my old job was named Chad and he was legitimately one of the best guys I've ever met.
pazimpanet	I want to be Hans Zimmer.  
pazimpanet	Cut to two months later:  "We're going to be cracking down on the overtime."
pazimpanet	Watch or read the Martian.
pazimpanet	You have no idea what you're talking about.
pazimpanet	Is that not normal?
pazimpanet	A couple of years ago there were two sovereign citizens building bombs in their house when one went off and one of the guys got his arm blown off. I was crying listening to the recording on the radio of this guy asking for help from the government that he doesn't believe he should have to pay taxes to. Then they both got a nice prison sentence.
pazimpanet	I tried to find unbiased sources that talk about molten steel specifically and not just molten metal (specifically and provably opposed to aluminum which melts at a much lower temperature) and had some trouble. 
pazimpanet	Good source. Send me something without the word "truth" in the title/URL and I will review.
pazimpanet	It's even worse than that. It's actually saying "I'd rather both of our children be dead than raise an autistic child myself," as them not vaccinating their children puts all children at risk.
pazimpanet	Ooohhh I see.  [then my answer would be that they didn't.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/)
pazimpanet	They don't have to melt to lose strength and cause a collapse. This is pretty well documented and just plain common sense.
pazimpanet	I think that that was his point. It can bend and shape without needing to melt and if wood and air can get it hot enough to lose its structural integrity, then jet fuel definitely could.
pazimpanet	"Dinosaurs are just lies that are fed to us to cover up the existence of Pokémon."  -Will Ferrell
pazimpanet	I know, I was just making a stupid joke. I didn't downvote you, I'll get you back to 1.
pazimpanet	The amphibians that actually rule the world. They just wanted to get us off of their trail.
pazimpanet	"White male moments before drowning a mother and her baby."  
pazimpanet	Yup! And I would think that it's probably pretty safe to assume that if they're employed by the police force they aren't illegal immigrants. I guess to OP all the brown people are the same?
pazimpanet	The Alamo?
pazimpanet	Hungry and a little bit sleepy.
pazimpanet	I can't imagine how amazing my life would be if that was the bar of whether or not I'm having a good day.
pazimpanet	It doesn't matter if they catch you. The general public will forget about it entirely the next time a cop shoots a black guy, a Muslim drives through a crowd, or one of the Kardashians queefs. Worst case scenario they make $1.3 Billion and have to pay a $200 Million fine for bad behavior.
pazimpanet	Or semen
pazimpanet	Or they can be like this one and be neither.
pazimpanet	And they're welcome to their opinions just like I'm entitled to mine.
pazimpanet	I said in my comment that it was neither. I didn't find it offensive, I just didn't really find it relatable as I don't think I've ever met a person like this so it came off as pretty neckbeardy and cringey to me.  [I was actually expecting it to have a last panel like this one where it's just a neckbeard staring at a girl in shorts. That would have made me laugh my ass off because I would have been able to relate more as I see dudes like that on here everyday.](https://m.imgur.com/r/Unexpected/S5UzB10) 
Tubbathis	What is something that people from your state or country know that outsiders probably do not? | 
Tubbathis	For me in Missouri it is probably Strange Music and Tech N9ne (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_N9ne)  Perhaps not so much any more due to some major success, but several years ago it was true.
Tubbathis	Where is this? I've always preferred my wings this way so I might be an honorary  resident.
Tubbathis	Hello. I am a XBOX NA player looking for a guild that is accepting of newbies and casual players. I do not get to play very often being a father, but I would to experience all content at some point. My character is names Treescale a stamwarden. My tag is Godking.
Tubbathis	Greasy
Tubbathis	Nic*
Tubbathis	Clinging so desperately to youth
Tubbathis	I didn't know Tabasco was hot
Tubbathis	I brought you into this world and I can take you out.
Tubbathis	This is the only way to commemorate a relationship. Take notes 
Tubbathis	Bath salt zombies
Tubbathis	I don't get this?
Tubbathis	He's sucking that gut in so hard
Tubbathis	This must be what it looks like when you change your characters appearance in character customization.
Tubbathis	Who the fuck puts barbeque on steak.
Tubbathis	The 4th of July is a celebration of country, not the current state of the country. Not only that, who doesn't love to blow shit up?
Tubbathis	Y'all niggas got OC, I got a repost
Tubbathis	There once was a man being chased by a tiger through a forest. Eventually, the tiger chased him off of a cliff. As he was falling he caught on to a branch, and below him was another tiger. Knowing death was assured the man looked around until out of the corner of his eye he noticed a wild strawberry. Plucking the strawberry, he ate the fruit. It was the best strawberry the man had ever tasted. 
Tubbathis	Colorados thing is blowing it out I guess.
Tubbathis	Spreading the love.
Tubbathis	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility   This is what happens in crowds. The more people present the less likely an individual will take action as they see it as someone else's job or responsibility.
Tubbathis	He's wondering if he's old enough to tell the POTUS he's a fucking goon
Tubbathis	Honestly it's amazing how a mindset is fostered into a geographical area. What seems the norm to someone who has never left home can be alien to the rest of the world. Travel gives you the opportunity to be open minded.
Tubbathis	The biggest for me was growing up in a small rural farming community, then visiting the east coast. Night and day. I didn't realize how prejudiced and xenophobic my community was.
Tubbathis	There sure are. I've found that the major consencus is that farming communities are poor and it's not the case. There is a lot of money in farming, but what these people seem to be lacking in is open-mindedness, and fear of change. Most of the time things have been the way they are for years or they miss the old days and distrust societal progress.
Tubbathis	In some places. I don't want to misconstrue and say all the Midwest is this way, but I've seen it.
Tubbathis	I think with the ongoing sales you will see some new blood, but it's not a game for everyone. I found for myself between the random disconnects and limited play time it wasn't a good match for me.
Tubbathis	You sucking?
Tubbathis	[LFP] casual and achievements | Hey there. I just recently got MC to work again on my Xbox and I'm looking for 3 to 5 people to play with me on my server.   I am 23 years old, and I have a mic. I'm looking for mature people who enjoy messing around and may be achievement hunters like me. I won't put an age requirement but I would prefer people with some life experience.  My gamertag is Bathtub Skooma  My playtime is random due to my work schedule. Could be anywhere between 8am to 11pm central.
Tubbathis	Bethesda messaged me so without spoiling much I will just say yes
Tubbathis	Split Affinity achievement | So anyone achievement hunting yet? I'm curious if you can get the achievement in any order or if you must do it as Typhon and then Human.
Tubbathis	I loved the emotion when Historia wanted to bring the fucking tower down. She was lost in the moment and wanted nothing more than her Titan  in hiding friend to live her life. They had quite a bond.  I would like to have seen them run after the tower fell. I guess she wasn't thinking when the Titans game up from the rubble.   /Mourn 
Tubbathis	You see so many people flyin' n' slashin' it gets hard to remember whose doin' it, aye?
Tubbathis	I believe there has been a misunderstanding.
Tubbathis	Gotta marry her.
Tubbathis	Your minutes up. It should be expected you can't just pick up a sword and start slaying 7m monsters
Tubbathis	He is someone kinkiers dream come true I am sure.
Tubbathis	If it were to be a literal bomb I would think it to be an EMP.
Tubbathis	Tax write off
Tubbathis	I think she did it more because it needed done and Naoto would not have allowed it.
Tubbathis	nice udyr tattoo 
Tubbathis	Returning player simple question | I quit back in early 2016. Anyway I can get caught up on what is current meta and things to look out for? Website or just a simple comment would help me out tremendously. Thanks

Tubbathis	The box itself is a sex toy if you use your imagination
Tubbathis	how starved for attention are these girls? I just feel so sorry that their lives come to this point where they feel the need to use their bodies to get attention, it ain't trashy it's fucking depressing
Tubbathis	breakfast lunch and dinner is for beginners you dont even know
Tubbathis	Personally I prefer the "gape extravaganza" to the "triple anal destroyer" but it's a matter of preference. The clamps help with stretching the hole to the point of prolapse in my experience, whereas with the TAD, it does just that.
Tubbathis	I mean shit talk about life improvements not about your little brother falling in love with your minimal arse
Tubbathis	EXISTENCE IS PAIN
Tubbathis	Dunno if your gonna make it to school before the alarm goes off bruh

Tubbathis	Karma is the only reason to be on this site afterall. fuck real opinions and intelligent conversation, internet points validate me.
Tubbathis	truly what the fuckkkkk
Tubbathis	The magic of some memes is the absurdity of it all
Tubbathis	you deserve gold alas im too poor to gild you.  enjoy silver.
Tubbathis	Do you ever sit and think about the impact less caffeine can make on your day? like influencing the decision to talk to someone you could be friends with who later comes to be a mass murderer or a talk show host or a guy who works at the boat
Tubbathis	Ok then i'll stop being a dick and help. What does she like and does she like/hate subtitles?
Tubbathis	you were high when you made this
Tubbathis	dont mention circlejerking then bring up politics lol
Tubbathis	oh shit guys he got us we are trolled

Tubbathis	suicide
Tubbathis	wow very gaye
Tubbathis	most people in this sub to low of intellect or stoned to do anything themselves
Tubbathis	You could recognize anime is not for everyone.
Tubbathis	anxiety is a bitch, poor little fella
Tubbathis	not scary just pedophilia 
Tubbathis	no the shit doesnt exist and people with mental illness or a sick desire to believe in bullshit perpetuate it. theres nothing wrong with you, just give up on the fantasy.  something cannot exist if there's no proof of it.
Tubbathis	different strokes for different folks
Tubbathis	the lord giveth and taketh away
Tubbathis	Why people so weird about bodily fluids? Your girl awesome enough to swallow that shit and you can't even kiss her. Too many mafuckas not safe in they sexuality bruh
Tubbathis	Read the meme amigo, nutting in someone's mouth don't happen by accident.
Tubbathis	Who cares?
Tubbathis	them twitter boys quick

Tubbathis	must have listened to coloring bork
Tubbathis	It's not a BLB. The people who did it knew they couldn't announce it to the world, it was the satisfaction of performing the act and keeping the secret.

willowhanna	What's the saddest sentence you can think of? | 
willowhanna	This one actually just made me suddenly feel sad. Well done.
willowhanna	This gives me hope and makes me feel better but also terrifies me
willowhanna	that's three sentences
willowhanna	Shrek is a #FellowKid | 
willowhanna	At least you're being nicer to me than he is. Thanks
willowhanna	That's heartbreaking
willowhanna	I can't believe I ever loved you
willowhanna	Yeah I'm familiar with the original, this version does change the meaning of it though.
willowhanna	why does this comment remind me of my ex-boyfriend
willowhanna	if only yours was still a sentence
willowhanna	I can slice a banana with playing cards. I think its pretty cool, but not useful at all
willowhanna	:(
willowhanna	only if you're in America
willowhanna	What should Redditors do more to make Reddit a better experience for everyone? |

willowhanna	Yesterday, which I'm proud of because I've cried almost everyday for about a month so a whole day without that is great! Its really hard when someone who used to love you just doesn't anymore.
willowhanna	"Thank you"
willowhanna	I completely gave up on that months ago. Takeaway is just too good. 
willowhanna	What lie do you tell most frequently, either to yourself or to others? | 
willowhanna	When I was about 8 I used to go over to my friends house just so we could play Sims 2. We played it on her family computer for the hour or two she was allowed to use it. I remember making a sim for the first time, and excitedly telling my mom all about it as soon as I got home. I got Sims 3 for myself as soon as it came out and have been a sims player ever since!
willowhanna	Aw that sucks. Good luck with all your tests!
willowhanna	Its only been a bit over a month, but its been the longest month of my life. I don't really want a new partner, I wasn't looking for one when I got my last one and I'm definitely not looking for one now.
willowhanna	Stupid cliche, heartbreak. It doesn't really feel like it will ever go away.
willowhanna	What song do you listen to when you need to calm down? | 
willowhanna	sadly its exactly the same for me. Someone I considered my best friend stopped talking to me, blocked me, and basically erased any trace I ever existed in their life. It crushed me. And I've cried about it almost everyday for the past month. I'm hoping the best will happen for the both of us, whether that means reconnecting with friends or gradually moving on. I know its hard but theres so much goodness ahead so I'll try not to think about the past too much :)
willowhanna	I'm sorry :( Usually the best thing to do is give it time. I know that can be hard to do, but let your friend have time to think and maybe they'll reconsider and unblock you. Try not to worry about it and hopefully everything will work itself out.
willowhanna	Yeah its a horrible feeling. I wish I could give you advice but if I had any I wouldn't be feeling like this either. I hope everything gets better for you <3
willowhanna	My friend is currently in one of the worst relationships I've seen, a lot of strange abuse from both sides and outside forces. But my relationship, that was so much better and healthier than theirs, ended because I was apparently too much to deal with but also too boring. And now I'm even jealous of my friend's terrible relationship, because how can they still be together when I'm alone. So I get ya.
willowhanna	[Serious] What's the saddest thing that's happened to you in the past week? | 
willowhanna	this really did calm me down a bit. thank you
willowhanna	I really do understand this. I've had some trouble with a very close friend recently and it hurts not having them when you need them. I miss his dog too. I'll send you a virtual hug, because I know just how wonderful a good cuddle would be right now. 
willowhanna	I have all of The Lonely Island's albums on vinyl, just to annoy my parents who said they would be the worst albums ever to have on vinyl. They're actually my most played vinyls at this point.
willowhanna	You sound like a great friend to have.
willowhanna	I'm sorry to hear about your friend. Dreams like that are the worst because you know theres nothing you can do. At least he still lives on in your memories and can be remembered by someone who cared about him.
willowhanna	I'm sorry to hear that :( I hope everything turns out okay
willowhanna	thanks for the link! it does sound very calming
willowhanna	I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm sure you can work everything out with your friend. I wish you the best <3
willowhanna	love itself.
willowhanna	I hope it all gets sorted out for you
willowhanna	that sucks :/ but also if that's the saddest thing that happened to you in the past week consider yourself lucky
willowhanna	Do you know anyone with the same birthday as you? | [removed]
willowhanna	this is a nightmare 
willowhanna	What food do you wish more people would try? | 
willowhanna	What's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you in the past week? | 
willowhanna	Honestly even when I can tell I'm about to be rick rolled I'll happily click and listen to the whole song I love it
willowhanna	What song always cheers you up? | 
willowhanna	Do you and /u/Qu4ckL0rd go to the same school? You posted pictures of the same posters within minutes of each other haha
willowhanna	What do you miss from your childhood? | 
willowhanna	Potatoes. Yeah, they're great tbh, so much you can do with them.
willowhanna	Yeah Ireland! The famine wasn't great so we're all glad to have those potatoes back
willowhanna	What is the last reason you cried? | 
willowhanna	I just got teary eyed reading it too :(
willowhanna	I'm really sorry. Losing a friend is the worst. I hope it gets easier for you, even if it takes time.
willowhanna	If you could have any animal as a pet, which would you get? | 
willowhanna	Reddit, what is the biggest lie you've ever told, and did you get away with it? | 
willowhanna	Asleep, even though I have to be up early tomorrow
willowhanna	doesn't match the video clip but [Good Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjPLkPsLxc4) has children singing the chorus
willowhanna	This one really gets me
willowhanna	What small thing really annoys you, but doesn't seem to annoy anyone else? | 
willowhanna	Honestly any words of encouragement would help. It's been a really tough month.
willowhanna	How do you stop yourself from getting bored while playing? | I love Sims 4, but I find it hard to play for more than a few hours at a time. I've tried doing some of the challenges but I lose interest very quickly. What do you do if you start getting bored?
willowhanna	I now have an urge to delete my comment so nobody will know what yours is replying to
willowhanna	Maybe in case the previous comment is deleted, so their comment will still make sense.
willowhanna	Thank you, stranger! I'm hoping September will be a lot better :)
willowhanna	You could try skipping that part, the rest of the movie is more exciting I promise 
willowhanna	You okay?
willowhanna	Nah I think he was doing it wrong
willowhanna	Reddit, what did you dream about last night? | 
willowhanna	Not a band, actually just one person.
willowhanna	Sex
willowhanna	You'd think an Irish person would be able to spell Michael Collins ;)
willowhanna	this wasn't a previous comment you cheater
willowhanna	I'll give it a watch someday when I'm channel hopping and happen to land on it haha
willowhanna	And I've somehow still never seen the movie...
willowhanna	Discovered why the sky is blue
willowhanna	Well that has to do with how powerful the waves are on that beach. The more powerful the wave, the more rocks will get broken up and will become sand. If the waves aren't that powerful it will be harder for them to break up the rocks. Waves are created by wind blowing over the water, so windier areas are more likely to have sandy beaches.
willowhanna	Sand is just very fine rock and mineral particles, so it depends on how large the rocks are.  Sand is defined as being finer than gravel, so any beach where the majority of rocks are as coarse or coarser than gravel would be rocky.
willowhanna	Daveed Diggs from clipping.
willowhanna	Thanks
willowhanna	I will when I find someone new to do it with
willowhanna	It's sad that we can lose the ability to have such dreams.
willowhanna	How often do you normally dream? Was it unusual not to dream last night, or is it rare you do have and/or remember dreams?
willowhanna	Well most of them to be honest 
willowhanna	I'd like to agree, but being told repeatedly to fuck off by someone you considered a very close friend when you don't think you've done anything wrong is a horrible horrible feeling. At least when he ignored me I could hope that a part of him still actually liked me.
willowhanna	Changing the number of days absent I had on the school computer. It's a good thing to have all the computer teachers trust you enough to let you use the computer room without any supervision. I could have changed my grades too but I thought that would've been too far.
willowhanna	I want you to show me
willowhanna	I love how vague this is
willowhanna	Only thing I can think of is Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush. 
willowhanna	[Safe Haven?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1702439/?ref_=kw_li_tt)
willowhanna	Where would the hands go?
willowhanna	My boyfriend back. It's the stupidest wish but I really miss him and I'm just especially sad about it right now for some reason.
willowhanna	It was actually exactly three weeks ago. Fucking terrible day.
willowhanna	I use those for parties too and I'm not American or in America 
willowhanna	My dad is in his 40s and still can't drive, so you aren't doing too bad tbh
willowhanna	Matilda 
willowhanna	What age were you?
willowhanna	Pretty mundane things usually, stuff we would have done together. Sometimes we're still together in them and sometimes we aren't. They really aren't that exciting to be honest. But there's obviously part of me that just can't get over him.
B1narySunset	I think that the first version is superfluous, but that's just me.

B1narySunset	Why does marijuana exacerbate my anxiety? | I have friends who smoke marijuana and they say it makes them feel very energetic and talkative. I'm the complete opposite - it makes me feel extremely anxious with racing negative thoughts. This happens to the point where I hate smoking it. Why is my reaction so different?
B1narySunset	qt creator

B1narySunset	This shit is fucking dumb
B1narySunset	It's possible, but very unlikely. The closest we'll probably get to modernized graphics are through mods like the one [shown here (Client 2.0)](http://www.modthegalaxy.com/forums/thread-client-2-0). But even then the mods take a lot of work.

ifockpotatoes	Lakeview Manor and the surrounding area. It's just the ideal location for a house, in both Skyrim and IRL.   I like to think my DB is happily retired smoking a blunt while watching the sunset there as I speak.
ifockpotatoes	I have Interesting NPCs installed so that necromancer is pretty much just a harmless weirdo now.  Anyway just kill em lmao
ifockpotatoes	I don't think there are many dragon burial mounds to raise outside of Skyrim. 
ifockpotatoes	Definitely saddest in November-December, because daytime is practically nonexistent for a while here. Wears on you pretty fast.
ifockpotatoes	Honestly, gaming. Nowadays there are only one or two games per year that really capture my interest, If that. I used to play everything. Now it's just a massive Steam library full of greyed out titles.
ifockpotatoes	My car, which looked weirdly like one of those wind-up Lego cars, broke down. A white van pulled up beside me and Hideo Kojima got out. He installed some weird booster jets on it and I went flying through the air and woke up.
ifockpotatoes	I love the fact that it's never too hot, and it's secluded due to being in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. Air feels fresh too.  I hate the fact that I will be plunged into eternal darkness pretty soon.

ifockpotatoes	I kinda hope he grows the beard out again.  Cause [goddamn Nikolaj looks good with the beard.](https://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/385/files/2014/03/nikolaj.png)

ifockpotatoes	Which races most frequently interbreed? How would a hybrid child be looked upon in whatever country they grow up in? | Just curious. I'm guessing Imperials and Nords are probably the most frequent cross, but that would probably go entirely under the radar, looking like whatever the mother was and little else. But would there still be some kind of stigma among the Cyrodillic nobility with a half Nordic child? What about other races, like the Dunmer or Altmer?
ifockpotatoes	They can get traits of the other race though can they not? Otherwise Bretons and their mildly pointy ears wouldn't be a thing 
ifockpotatoes	*item doesn't scan*  That means it's free right?

ifockpotatoes	A receipt from Wal-Mart. Uh.
ifockpotatoes	[Realistic Melee Range.](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80076/?)   One of those things that will take a lot of getting used to, but I can't live without now. Fights between NPCs in particular look...a lot less stupid now. Especially nice when used with TK Dodge.
ifockpotatoes	Jaime is Azor Ahai. Just watch. It'll be worth it. 
ifockpotatoes	Followed by Tormund digging his way out of the rubble, looking pissed. 
ifockpotatoes	ME FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS PLEASE HELP | 
ifockpotatoes	Is a sympathetic Thalmor character actually possible? | I've been day dreaming a bit, and I'm really starting to wonder. It there actually any chance of a character being introduced in some future TES game that brings some more nuance to the Thalmor? If so, how would you go about this? 
ifockpotatoes	Somehow, I don't think it'll be that big of a deal. Jon might whinge a bit, but they're Targaryens. Aunt/Nephew is pretty tame for them lmao.
ifockpotatoes	Stop whinging
ifockpotatoes	I'm guessing actually Emilia Clarke and Kit. They've both done sex scenes before, not like they have any problem with it.
ifockpotatoes	I gotta give props to Aiden Gillen. He actually made me feel a bit bad for Littlefinger with his acting here.

ifockpotatoes	Donate a quarter to charity for karma, then enjoy my $999,999,999.75 to spend on hookers and blow 
ifockpotatoes	It's LE. Just using Vivid Weathers + its own optimized ENB. :)
ifockpotatoes	Strap Longclaw to a bolt and shoot it 
ifockpotatoes	What is the most morally questionable thing that is actually 100% legal? | 
ifockpotatoes	If what I know about actual lower body paralysis IRL is correct, it does still work, he just can't feel anything. Which makes sex...hard, and not in a good way. 
ifockpotatoes	I like to think that Jon is about on the same level now that Rhaegar was. 
ifockpotatoes	Perhaps after the Boatsex hype has been fulfilled, we can go back to what truly matters: Brienne and Tormund hype.   I will die for my beliefs. 
ifockpotatoes	I think some mods do - IIRC Rigmor of Bruma adds a few, and I can't remember the name but there's a series of mods that add villages in the no man's land between Skyrim/Morrowind/Cyrodiil/Hammerfell.  I'm no modder but I think it's harder than just adding assets though - there's no navmeshing out there, the scale is all wrong, you just fall through the floor after a while, etc etc.
ifockpotatoes	Border to Morrowind | 
ifockpotatoes	Somehow, the low poly mountain range makes the land look bigger than it actually is for some reason. :P
ifockpotatoes	Going way back, Maester Luwin's death in season 2. The way he nearly cries with relief when he sees Bran and Rickon are safe...ugh. 
ifockpotatoes	You heard this bit of [season 7 soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Psg5mV4c) yet? No idea what it'll play for, but damn if it doesn't look like we'll have one of those moments again. 
ifockpotatoes	I think it'd be an interesting twist for our Sareebas to be our Spirit Healer archetype.   Maybe she swore off the aggressive, nuclear bomb-like magic Sareebas seem to use in favor of gentler magic, to ward off the innate savageness that Iron Bull and Solas both mention. 
ifockpotatoes	Be careful who you make fun of in middle school
FL_Squirtle	Digits and Dial Master VaJhonna to melt your face ;) | 
FL_Squirtle	TIL that all iPhones are for the simple minded folk
FL_Squirtle	The one thing I can't stand in this world..... parents who refuse to actually be parents. Good for you for being their for your step sons. It's never easy dealing with that especially when the kids are likely thinking she just didn't want to see them that day...
FL_Squirtle	Got to love when assholes are put in their place
FL_Squirtle	Yes they do use the 1225 batteries but can also use the 1620s as long as you use the larger casing. :)
FL_Squirtle	Okay cool thanks for the info, I'll def try just logging in again soon haha yea really confused as to why it was just deactivated especially when I was just logged into it that day. 
FL_Squirtle	Np let me know if you have any questions, we can't wait to get thse out to everyone :D
FL_Squirtle	Sounds like he's taking his jealousy of how healthy you are and look out on you. Is he a couch potato or does he work out regularly too? He could be feeling lazy and resenting that he's not getting in shape too?
FL_Squirtle	[HELP] After linking my Amazon Prime account I can't login... | After linking my Prime account whenever I go to login it now says it's the incorrect password. I try to go through the steps to reset my password and it says there is no email on file for my username..... how does that even happen?? Anyone.... please help! :)  UPDATE: I submitted an email request and saw the form to submit through the google doc when this happens. Looks like my account got deactivated for some reason. Anyone know how long this takes?
FL_Squirtle	Here's a link to the full list of features of the Ions from Futuristic Lights. Highly recommend if you don't mind waiting until the end of the month :)   https://futuristiclights.com/products/ion-c2c-led-glove-set?variant=43359616515
FL_Squirtle	Got to love that we have to rely on a shit relief company like the Red Cross while government officials are making that much in undisclosed salary each year -_-Merica' 
FL_Squirtle	Maybe if they stop making movies with the same crap cookie cutter formula people would actually want to spend a small fortune going to the movies again. 
FL_Squirtle	The chance he could just fall in and be swept away never to be seen again.
FL_Squirtle	Good hahah I always think it's hilarious when people try to be assholes to cats and get bit in the ass lmao
FL_Squirtle	Link to the Ion's: https://futuristiclights.com/collections/all/products/ion-c2c-led-glove-set?variant=43359616515
FL_Squirtle	These will be the perfect replacements! 
FL_Squirtle	Taint doing what he does best with those smooth connections! | 
FL_Squirtle	If you think about it Centurions are just the ultimate sparring partner. Get gud. 
FL_Squirtle	Can confirm same happens here 
FL_Squirtle	Ahhh damn I wish we could get them in time for it! Soon at least :)
FL_Squirtle	Happy to answer any questions you've got! We're looking to have all of production done and start shipping by the end of September :)
FL_Squirtle	Perfect just in time haha thanks for the support! As for demo loop there are no other loops outside of that. We are thinking of the different ways to implement demo loop in future lights though beyond this simple of one : ) 
FL_Squirtle	Oh nice Oracles are still awesome lights! Yea we can't wait for everyone to get their set! 
FL_Squirtle	Awesome! Of course, so on the Atoms I'm not sure if you had a set, when you were in conjure mode it was almost an instant button click to get back out of conjure so it really had bad timing and was tough to work with. We basically extended the timer. I don't have an exact time for you but am working on getting what that number is :) 
FL_Squirtle	The Ion C2C LED Glove Set is here! Link to full list of features in the description :) | 
FL_Squirtle	hahah sweet enjoy!!!! Me too.... me too :(
FL_Squirtle	Wow thank you we really appreciate that! We're incredibly happy to not only finally have something out that's entry level but also something that people can really enjoy using without breaking the bank. Can't wait to hear what you think of them once they're on your hands!
FL_Squirtle	Is what it is haha :)
FL_Squirtle	I just made another post the full list of features is live! Yes they do come with c2c ;)
FL_Squirtle	if they could somehow make this work on the PC as a massive Team Deathmatch kinda thing this would be epic lmao
FL_Squirtle	All info gets dropped this afternoon!!!! :)
FL_Squirtle	To start you're going to be getting more than double the amount of modes that come on the EZLites. You'll get our full 38 color palette to choose from along with true brightness control. Basically you're going to have a light that's about 3x more capable than the EZLites just in regards to their programming possibilities. In addition to that you'll be getting two new features, one has never been released on a light this affordable and the second is something we've never had on any of our lights.   All the details are released tomorrow, but trust me when I say the $40 price is a steal compared to what you're getting :)
FL_Squirtle	Not too sure the reason for the downvotes lol
FL_Squirtle	I hope she loves them! :) 
FL_Squirtle	With the new Futuristic Lights Ion on it's way out for pre-order at less than $40, what are you hoping for out of them? | You might be able to pry some information out of me with the right questions, but all info will be released this coming Wednesday! Set for a ship date at the end of September, this will be the very first entry level light that FL has released. I think you'll be pretty impressed and surprised by what they'll have! 
FL_Squirtle	Futuristic Lights is getting to release our very first entry level light. Pre-Order starts this Wednesday and we'll be releasing towards the end of September :) I can't give you really any details just yet but all that gets announced on Wednesday. They will be a pre-order price of less than $40 and will come with a lifetime warranty. They are nano sized as well so they'll be a perfect fit for your wife! 
FL_Squirtle	Good anyone who hunts for sport is like that guy with the over-sized truck compensating for something. 
FL_Squirtle	For someone that has always been interested in Glass Blowing, where would you suggest one starts?   How long have you been training dogs for service, and what is the hardest part about that would you say?
FL_Squirtle	To start I'd probably look at picking it up as a hobby to know I'll like it. I've always wanted to find something I could pour my artistic soul into and nothing has ever stuck. I've tried so many different things but Glassblowing has been on my list to try for years now. I'll check out those videos thank you!
FL_Squirtle	Awesome thank you for the help! It's very interesting the capacity that animals can have for things like service. From the video it looks like you're doing a great job keep it up!
FL_Squirtle	The fact that kids age 5 and under have actual cell phones and tablets is sickening. Got to love how lazy this world has become even with something as maternal as motherly instinct. 
FL_Squirtle	This sounds like the start of an Asian Subway porno lol
FL_Squirtle	The epics you're using should be at least lvl 4 to help you push passed that arena
FL_Squirtle	You will quickly find out in this world that it is extremely rare for a business or your boss to care when it comes time to you needing something. If it doesn't involve you working or doing something to help the business they won't care
FL_Squirtle	Fine if no one else will say it.... Thank you cats for providing the world a much needed survival of the fittest sweep ;) 
FL_Squirtle	Lined that up like a game of checkers!
FL_Squirtle	Very nice haha yea I have bandit lvl 2 and use mirror in my deck so every so often I'll mirror her and those one hit KOs with no dmg are the best especially when they drop their wizards haha
FL_Squirtle	Sopranos, Boardwalk, True Blood, GoT, Westworld, The Wire, The Oz, then Girls :)
FL_Squirtle	Well if you're talking about the cup of noodles that's Styrofoam and shouldn't go in there anyways. If you're just talking about heating up water to put in the instant ramen do you not have a stove?  
FL_Squirtle	Glad you went in and got it checked before the worst happened. How ironic though a doctor not wanting to see a doctor haha
FL_Squirtle	Maury along with other shows similar to it were all pretty much staged. 
FL_Squirtle	Not eating at dinner. Stop acting like you aren't human. You eat, it's okay to eat, I want you to eat. That's the whole reason for the meal. Oh guess what you poop too and that's okay lol
FL_Squirtle	I have so much respect for cops that actually hold standards for their own. It's how it should be, unfortunately we're stuck with most just putting their head down and letting whatever happen happen. 
FL_Squirtle	Just save yourself the headache and don't use a microwave. It completely kills any sort of nutritional value you get from your food anyways. Get a toaster oven those don't mess with any wifi signals and you won't get cancer from it :)
FL_Squirtle	Worst physical pain would have to be when I got fissure on my rectum. This one in particular was a cut on the outside of my anus and extended inside to the soft parts of the inner wall. So basically for 3months while it healed I could not eat right, I could not sit right. Going to the bathroom basically made it feel like I was tearing it all over again every single time. Not to mention the risk of infection was ridiculous so I had to clean it with medicine every time I went. I would not wish that pain on my worst enemy
FL_Squirtle	Back when a person working full time actually provided a good life for themselves and their family. Nowadays unless you're some top dog CEO or running your own business everyone in the family is working and likely working more than 1 job just to scrape by. 
FL_Squirtle	Highway robbery at it's finest
FL_Squirtle	Stop being afraid of driving faster than 60 on the freeway Grandpa 
FL_Squirtle	This world still needs you. Your children still need you. Even if it doesn't seem that way all of this is just going to make you stronger in life. 
FL_Squirtle	Sounds like she was packing a little more than you thought lol
FL_Squirtle	Coworker of mine does not know how to attach a file via email. Explained it probably 10 times over and still asks every single time. Not to mention any of the times he needs to do anything in Microsoft Office good luck
FL_Squirtle	For a split second think of every single moment you've ever felt love from anyone. Think about how good that makes you feel and how it makes this crazy life worth all the nonsense for those moments.   Now that you've got that pretty picture painted imagine you were told it was all a lie. You were only being used for X reason and those moments that you've built your entire being of existence on are all just fake. Everything crumbles, everything feels like nothing and life becomes numb. 
FL_Squirtle	According to the rando shop down the street or the country? 
FL_Squirtle	The Beatles
FL_Squirtle	This happens more often than not on the freeways of Cali.... it's terrifying 
FL_Squirtle	Oh come to California there are plenty of them. It's those people who jerk whenever changing lanes, give 10 car space anytime they are driving anywhere. 
FL_Squirtle	There's one thing being careful and there's another being terrified. Nobody should be driving if they're terrified to do so yet 90% of the population does. 
FL_Squirtle	Honestly I feel like people use the fast or passing lane as a lane that keeps them away from the rest of traffic because they're terrified of driving. 
FL_Squirtle	That's awful I'm sorry
FL_Squirtle	So what happens when something bad is going on and someone is threatening you or your family and you have no means to protect yourself AND guess what? They've got guns because they're criminals and they will find a means to carry out whatever they please regardless of any laws in place, sooooo you going to call the baton beating cops over to help? 
FL_Squirtle	Please find help. It's very common for someone who is depressed to put on a smile and act like everything fine. That's why depression is a silent killer. Back in High School and even no still sometimes I have slumps that I get stuck in. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to PM me. 
FL_Squirtle	oh god I'm sorry glad it's all good now
FL_Squirtle	The only logical reason I need is the fact that if something life threatening happens it's not going to wait around for someone to show up to help. If someone breaks into my home and threatens the livelihood of myself or the ones I care about I don't want to not have the means to protect what I love.   A criminal is always going to find a way to carry out any crime they have planned regardless of any laws that are in place. Not to mention the fact that a country with citizens without arms is basically just asking to be controlled and abused entirely by their government
FL_Squirtle	Yup.... was getting blood work done when I was in a rough spot. Basically was already losing a ton of weight and couldn't eat and was getting sick almost every day so my nutritional levels were next to nothing.   Person taking the blood is having a hard time finding my vein. Proceeds to fish around for it while I tell him I'm going to pass out and his response was just a few more tries and I'll get it. Woke up to him trying to lift me up off the ground with the needle still in my arm. It was awful I felt like everything was just sucked out of me.
FL_Squirtle	Once again kids just blindly following an authority figure because they said so. I miss the days when kids questioned everything, at least we knew they weren't zombies
FL_Squirtle	Hahaha the real questions arise lol 
FL_Squirtle	Bruh
FL_Squirtle	I'm on call 24/7 to log in remotely to help troubleshoot for some hospital systems. That's usually a pretty easy go to since people can't be upset that I have to work haha
FL_Squirtle	North West. Some people need to stop filling this world with uselessness
FL_Squirtle	If you can maintain your lease at your old place for a couple weeks to a month after getting the keys to you new place. This way you don't have to box up things that are in drawers and you can just take them over in small trips. Makes packing and unpacking a piece of cake!
FL_Squirtle	Being electrocuted by a hotel key entry door. I still don't feel like my brain is running at full speed :/ 
FL_Squirtle	I don't understand how kids can be that naive and let it happen. We live in a pretty fucked up world when free thought and common sense is taught less than obedience to authority figures. 
FL_Squirtle	While my wife and I were walking from the parking lot of Downtown Disney about a year ago we saw a weird floating cloud like UFO looking thing. It looked exactly like a cloud but a cloud that was shaped smilar to that of a UFO. It hovered about 30 feet from the ground went up and back and in all sorts of direction and then slowly just flew away. We both looked at each other and then proceeded to be dumbfounded with about 30 other people that saw it too 
FL_Squirtle	You've already lived almost half your life why the change now??? that sounds awful
FL_Squirtle	Weed nowadays is so much more potent than even 5 years ago. Sorry you ran into someone who clearly isn't a nice pothead lol
FL_Squirtle	Hey some people like the mushy gushy parts of love 
FL_Squirtle	Wait.... why exactly were things being inserted into students??
FL_Squirtle	That poor kid is going through years of therapy now
FL_Squirtle	This is awesome thank you! I have a Galaxy S8 still working on figuring out the VR for it. Where do you go to download this?
FL_Squirtle	Ahh okay makes sense. Thanks!
FL_Squirtle	With labor laws nowadays 9/10 regardless of the firing reason the employee will still get unemployment. Got to love how the system works. I once worked with someone at a Smart and Final who was on unemployment for 2 years straight while maintaining a job all because he never stopped it
FL_Squirtle	Sparky if played correctly can be a great card..... play it right ;)
FL_Squirtle	Usually it's when your shop resets
FL_Squirtle	Well their person is still the same place soooo....
FL_Squirtle	If anything you are furthering you brain power passed the norm. Don't let someone else put you down for something they simply do not understand. Not to mention from my experience, people in the medical field think they're experts at everything they do...... they are far from it. 
FL_Squirtle	Meanwhile truck driver is sitting there just laughing at the pure ignorance. You'd be amazed at how little people read it all hahha
FL_Squirtle	They pay what maybe $10.00 a phone if that, then turn around and sell you it for $800. Oh wait don't forget in 2 years they'll release another one with a slightly upgraded camera and a slightly larger screen size..... oh I forgot about it being thinner too. Tell me how that's not a scam? Every single person who buys an iPhone is getting ripped off to a pretty absurd extent. 
FL_Squirtle	The word chargeback is a business killer these days
FL_Squirtle	It's to be expected they don't want to admit any younger kid could have knowledge that they don't. I feel like with how stupid people are nowadays and how common sense is gone, you won't see old farts like that too much more. Cherish them you'll miss those old farts when all you see is some dits asking an obvious question over and over lol
FL_Squirtle	Agreed there are very few religions that don't push their beliefs onto others. What you're supposed to do and what actually happens are two completely different things.   Unfortunately people take it upon themselves to interpret things how it best suites them and their advancement in life. I do not generalize Christianity lightly. Not only with the actions Christians take out in the world but in my own personal life they have proven to me time and time again that they are just pushing what THEY feel Christianity is and it's never pleasant for anyone that doesn't want to be a mindless Choir jockey. 
s6r1	Freud would like a word...
s6r1	Not sure if this is appropriate, but the FAQ recommends 1g of protein per pound of body weight. However, everywhere I look and ask people recommend at least twice that..,
s6r1	Not sure if this is appropriate, but the FAQ recommends 1g of protein per pound of body weight. However, everywhere I look and ask people recommend at least twice that..,
s6r1	Yep, it's definitely super rare to use only weed as well here. Usually tobacco with weed/hash spread through, but not that much. Idk if our weed is different from US but I can't imagine smoking an entire pure weed joint, I'd probably throw up...
s6r1	It's common to mix tobacco and hasch, but we do treat ourselves to weed when we can
s6r1	I said it, 180cm and 65kg. I'm 16 though. It said in the FAQ that it should be 1g of protein per lb of body weight.
s6r1	I used a calculator online 
s6r1	I tried that website but all the meals are long to make or just some weird shit...
s6r1	Yep I saw that in the FAQ 
s6r1	Also, now that I've got this, how do I find a three meal plan that fits the macros? Seems like a lot of work if I try to calculate everything myself...
s6r1	Ok, but I read on the FAQ that carbs were up to 4.5g per kg, and mine is 7.5g per kg. Also, why should I remove carbs and add fat?
s6r1	My goal carb intake seems weird... | [removed]
s6r1	Will do, but I wouldn't say it's lagging. It's kind of how my body grew, maybe high estrogen or something.
s6r1	Balancing out upper and lower body? | [removed]
s6r1	Maybe he forgets to plug them in
s6r1	Just wanted to say that you don't look very happy or confident in the pictures. I might be wrong but from experience I know that guys who are insecure about their weight tend to be very shy and think that they can't be outgoing because of it. Don't be like that, it's important to know that confidence is not dependent on what you look like and will make your life better in every way.
s6r1	France prohibits the purchase of alcohol/cigarettes until 18. Everyone starts smoking and drinking at 15 here, including me.
s6r1	And what's funny or unusual about drinking at 16?
s6r1	speak your personal experience that goes against the "hurr durr apple is overpriced piles of shit" opinion, get down voted. reddit is full of retards
s6r1	Final Cut Pro isn't professional software? How about the entire Adobe Suite? Also, a touchscreen laptop is a very niche market, no one wants that
s6r1	not like you're looking for a pure audiophile experience with your iphone and bluetooth headphones. can't criticize bluetooth audio because you pay for the practicality and other features of the phone
s6r1	Where can I find Hanz de Fuko products!? | Preferably around the north west corner.
s6r1	I didnt find any at selfridge, was there supposedto be a hdf booth?
s6r1	tru.
s6r1	Yeah, funny how you can get road bike helmets and motorcycle helmets in the same price range...
s6r1	Except if they're running shoes, then the 100 Nikes will probably we worth it if they correspond to you.
s6r1	Not much of a review tbh
s6r1	My personal inspo album. Enjoy :) | 
s6r1	Detailed pictures would be nice here. If your hair naturally falls to the front, you can:  -wear a beanie/hat and let it naturally dry for a few weeks, see if it makes a change  -make sure you don't shampoo too often and use oils. Healthier hair = easier to style  -use a stronger styling product, a clay maybe  -try different blowdrying techniques. High heat and strong air flow are important. Make sure you are using a professional-grade hairdryer (doesn't mean expensive) 
s6r1	With fine hair, yes. Blow dry it backwards, using a round brush or denman brush to add some volume in the front. Use a medium hold, matte product to finish.  As always, the most important part is to experiment, a lot.
s6r1	W2C joggers in these pictures? | 
s6r1	Buying iPhone 7 to buy in France? | It's much cheaper in the US. I know I'd have to buy in a shop bc online it is only carrier-locked and can't be unlocked (right?). I read somewhere that it wouldn't be compatible with French 4G, is that right? (if yes, not that big a deal).  Apart, from that, could I? Thanks a lot
s6r1	Philosophy =/= fun, or you've never studied it
s6r1	Will look into it, prices are pretty high here in France. Ideally I'd be looking for retros like 4s, 6s, 3s, etc. I'll look on Alibaba.
s6r1	cws?
s6r1	10-150$= 90-135€. Reasonable price for a normal pair of shoes.  I bought my wc 4s for 210USD. Considerable difference. I was also super lucky and happened by Footlocker as they were arriving into the store. Reps are always available.
s6r1	aight thanks bro 
s6r1	Decent quality J fakes for 100-150$? | [removed]
s6r1	sick hair, how2get
s6r1	So nice
s6r1	alright cool thx
s6r1	how to get stacks like this pls
s6r1	ayyy
s6r1	How's the sound?  welp nvm i was thinking of rbh ep2
s6r1	Cool, thanks! Would you know any vid tutorials I could follow to try this myself?
s6r1	Trying out some basic fits that look good on me, thoughts? http://m.imgur.com/a/jLlP1
s6r1	Trying out some basic fits, thoughts? | 
s6r1	Hm, do you think showing this pic to a tailor would work? Also, is this just normal jean material?
s6r1	yeah, no way i'm going with 16gb again. and 32gb i would really hesitate, thankfully apple doesn't make that anymore. my spotify music on very high quality took up like 4gb already
s6r1	thanks everyone, but it has been bought. i'm waiting for the 7 release to look for secondhand 6s
s6r1	yeah, i had a 16gb before and it was hell...
s6r1	nope, it's around 420€ for a 16gb se. don't like the small form either. honestly gravitating towards oneplus 3 or other but i'd love an apple
s6r1	64, i'm pretty desperate for any phone right now but also want me to be satisfied with it for more than a month
s6r1	france
s6r1	Hesitant about buying iPhone 6... | A friend could sell me his iPhone 6 for 400€. He got it in Xmas 2014, it's not damaged at all, he sells a few cases with it, and it has iOS 10 on it.  I'm thinking that being 2 years old it's going to be laggy and I'll pretty quickly get frustrated with the quality and power of it... Thoughts?

s6r1	Yeah, but you also get Lamy 2ks for 210€ in shops
s6r1	can't you buy rhodia on amazon.com?
s6r1	examples? 
s6r1	Looks good and fits you.
s6r1	What?
s6r1	Nope, it sounded more dance/electro-y.
s6r1	Kendrick Lamar - i | 
s6r1	No problem :)
s6r1	Nope, I'm pretty sure it wasn't from Solveig, but the melody was very reminiscent of Intox
s6r1	[TOMT][song]Recent song that sounds like "Intoxicated" by Martin Solveig? | It's got the same type of melody and it actually went on the radio a few times but I can't seem to find the title...

s6r1	Hm. Definitely not trying to brag but (at 15, after a year of occasional parties) out of vodka, whisky, tequila, jager and manzana, nothing really made me go cray. Sure, pure vodka tastes like disinfectant, but apart from that it's meh. Maybe I'm not drinking enough? I vomited once but because of cigs and hookah.
s6r1	Lmao, mistakes such as?
s6r1	Aha, so if you start drinking at 15 you can't make mistakes on your first night out. Loophole!
s6r1	It's not a computer school like the one I was in before, however it is possible that for one or two classes we could used our computers to take notes, but it won't replace paper.  My plan was to have a notebook and accordion folder while at school, tearing pages and putting them in the folder (divided by each class), then reviewing them when I get home and putting them away in the binders which stay at home.
s6r1	first, those don't cost that much where I live. also, a rotring can last you years if well taken care of, so it's a pretty good investment.  And, most importantly, it's not my money. Except if I buy the Lamy2k, my parents will be paying. And it's not like all my money is going toward this.
s6r1	lmao what i don't pay that much, plus why should I be saving that?
s6r1	I love it. Keep going.
s6r1	Haha, don't really need 72 colors but do need high quality, reliable and nice bright colors, because "filling in maps" is one of the important final exams here.  I really love stationary, and also love things that are well made, well thought out (practical) and pleasing design wise. I don't mind supermarket basic stuff but I guess it'll have to do just like you said.  Any pen/USb/case/pencils/notebook you recommend?
s6r1	High school, 12th grade. We use all this regularly, I don't see what's extravagant.
s6r1	I think you will get people who criticize no matter what. However, this really speaks to me, it's basically exactly what I would like to do and so far I don't see any "flaws" with it. Just need more content.
s6r1	Hey, looks good!
s6r1	It's a bit expensive though...

s6r1	Products to buy while in America? | I live in France, and my dad is going to America soon. I wanted him to bring back Hanz de Fuko's sample kit since there are no HdF products in France, but it is sold out.  What else could I ask him to bring back? I'd prefer small amounts, as I want to try as many products as possible.
s6r1	I don't think a matte finish is really possible if you want very strong hold.  However, I used OSIS+ 3 (Session) hairspray from Schwarzkopf for a while and though it was not completely matte you couldn't see I had it in except if you looked really hard, and the hold was super strong.   I'd recommend not using it everyday as hairspray can damage your hair over time.
s6r1	Sleep: didn't do as I said at all, cause holiday lifestyle.  Water: not as much as I did before, cause holiday lifestyle.  Hygiene: pretty good but not good enough.  Meditation: none at all.  Reading: read like 2 pages total.  Organize my phone: it broke.  Talk to more friends: phone broke.  Workout: did for 2 days, ran one day, and built a pulp bar, so hopefully now I can really do the workouts.  Reflecting: none at all.
s6r1	I'm scared to go to the barber, what should I do? | First of all, I really want a haircut. My top length is ideal now, but the sides are wayy too long. Thing is, I shaved my hairline in December because I thought it didn't look good and been growing it back for a couple of months now, so there is a patch of hair in the corner of my forehead, which I hide with a fringe.  The barber will inevitably see this because despite just buzzing the sides he will probably wet my hair and pull my hair back. What should I do, just go and man through the shame?
s6r1	Asian? He doesn't look asian.
s6r1	-Sleep 8 hours every night, using my phone as an alarm  -Drink water all the time  -Rigorous hygiene routine (3x brush teeth, efficient shower, etc)  -10+ min meditation/day  -5+ pages of reading/day  -Organize my phone from the ground up  -Talk more to friends  -Follow the Beast Mode 30 day workout  -10+ min reflecting on my issues/day (incl. listing them)

s6r1	Cosy of assembling arrows vs buying them? | I shoot in the countryside so I lose my arrows a lot (6 in ~5 hours), I was wondering if I bought shafts, nicks, etc (by the dozen) and assembled them it would be cheaper than buying them (3€70/pc for basic beginner ones).
s6r1	I feel like I have no way to aim consistently, help pls | I have a cheap recurve with no sight on it, and when shooting in my backyard (~10m), I feel like there is no way for me to adjust my shot every time because there is nothing to make a reference point. Thus, I have no consistency in my shots and no accuracy. What should I do?

_revix_	Buy yourself a starter banjo and a book. I'd highly recommend the gold tone ac-1. It's very good for the price ($200).
_revix_	I am not in the least bit religious.  However, do any of the personalities believe in a religion, and in that case what do they believe happens after death (considering the amount of personalities).
_revix_	I know this is a bit late, but ever thought of crafting banjos? I'd love to buy a custom one.

_revix_	Thanks! And as for leading c#/c++: I would say these are one of the hardest languages, and would most definitely not recommend it as a first programming language. Instead, Id go with python or java. Pythons a good one because it's a little bit easier. However if you  go with java you'll lean many things that will transfer over to c++ (which I recommend over c#). But as far as actually learning, I'm sure it's similar to what you've done. Read books, watch videos. I read the e-book "c++ for dummies". As well as watched a 10 hour video which I cannot recall the name of. Eventually I bought myself a computer that wasn't a complete toaster and started going to the library and spending my days reading the books.

_revix_	I'm very interested in your account.
_revix_	I would highly suggest lessons for a complete beginner. If you were like me, playing the guitar for years then transferring over to the banjo then I'd say just go for it. But, in your case I would go with lessons. My first banjo was a gold tone. I absolutely loved it. Wasn't particularly made for volume, but still gets the job done none the less.
_revix_	I'll try to find it. I heard It in class the other day.
_revix_	The only song I can think that it sounds like is the unions civil war song. But played faster.
_revix_	Made my day :)

Fozziefu	What is the worst parenting advice someone has given to you or someone you know? | 
Fozziefu	Honestly probably safer.  My husbands grandma, when she was 85ish ran a red light and hit a car with a teen driver. Both cars were totaled and thankfully everyone was ok. The first time we saw her after the accident she spent most of the time complaining and appalled she was issued a ticket despite the fact the other car hit her. She didn't process the red light, only who hit who first. She hasn't driven since by family decision.  Edit: Making the words right. 
Fozziefu	People in my hometown used Facebook for evil. This article doesn't even cover the full crazy I witnessed unleashed in the worst game of social media telephone. | 
Fozziefu	Your "aha" moment? | What was the one defining moment (book, video, interaction, thought) that convinced you, without a doubt, there is no god? I'm curious how everyone got here. Personally, I was raised a Jehovah's Witness. I got out and realized the lies I had been fed. 
Fozziefu	The first time through the bible, the JW version, was with a woman during a weekly bible study when I was around 8 or 9. She did an amazing job hyping it, I never questioned the stories or meanings. When I got out one of the scariest things or me was reading a non-Witness version. I was raised to believe touching another faiths books could open me to demon possession which I think showed me how deep I was and allowed me to question more. If they convinced me of demon possession then what else? I read a bible without outside commentary and was astounded at the anger. It drained me. It wasn't my tipping point but I completely see how it is for others. It's sad too, knowing so many are completely content believing someone, as the bible depicts God, as being someone they want to follow. I mean, if a politician presented himself as God does in the bible they would never hold an office let alone define peoples lives.
Fozziefu	I regret saying "without a doubt" and should have thought that out better before I posted. 
Fozziefu	Raised Jehovahs Witness.  I have been out for quite a while but still catch myself. I struggle with anxiety a lot. As far back as I can remember I was told that the world would end at any moment, sometimes it was Armageddon and sometimes it was persecution (which included detailed stories of being rounded up and shot for following Jehovah). If I was doing anything, ANYTHING, that wasn't ok that was it. I would never see my family or loved ones again. We weren't allowed to associate with anyone outside the religion, no extra curricular activities, and no college. Everyone and everything I knew had to be thrown away when I left. I am luckier than others- my mom will say "hi" to me every few months but people I knew as a tiny tot won't even acknowledge my existence. It sucks. It was drilled into me to fear everything and honestly I hate that I gave up so much yet still carry fear. I have to talk myself down a lot more than I care to admit- BUT at least I have other freedoms. At least I can have a life and after I reason with myself can experience things that help me feel I've finally lived. 
Fozziefu	Your family walked around their new house saying "Jehovah" loudly in each room to drive away demons.  Also, no garage sale buys just in case there's an evil "attachment". 
Fozziefu	Future predictions. | So, I may just be looking at this wrong but... Why is it when you're a witness you are demanded to stay away from fortune tellers, psychics, ouiju boards, and horoscopes YET the governing body is allowed to "predict" the future? Is it too much to say they're predictions are a form of (incredibly inaccurate) divination?  Sorry- drinking - this may make more sense to me than you right now. 
Fozziefu	Return After Bankruptcy | We filed in February of 2016 and received the final papers in June, we are in Montana. We were told we need to turn our return over to the trustee and not to use any refund. Any ideas how much she can take? I had been told by someone that she can only take refunds attributed to January and February but anything after that is ours, haven't been able to find anything online successfully. Honestly, most of our refund is EIC and CTC so I'm also curious if those will be gone. Thank you!
Fozziefu	Stanford Rape Triggering Memories/Pain | I've posted before about my experiences as a witness, quite a long time ago though.  I was raped by a disfellowshipped witness (I know...I know...he was not a witness because he was disfellowshipped but was attending meetings and was reinstated soon after everything). His wife was studying with me, she had made a lot of the same "poor" teenage choices as myself and was considered an appropriate sister to help steer me back on track. It seemed weird they had me study with her, although I guess she had been disfellowshipped and reinstated so it was a cautionary tale. I was not baptized so maybe that made the choice ok too. I was studying to get dunked though, I thought that would fix me. Anyways...he raped me, I was 15 he was 22. His wife and I finished studying and she jumped in the shower to clean up before heading to meeting. He came home and found me reading in the living room alone. The elders wanted it kept in house, they wanted to counsel us and eluded to it being my fault because I had a flirtatious nature, I was asked to write about how I thought Babylon the Great was seen and how I should see "her". A family member who was not in anymore got me to a police station, a week later, and we filed a report. It went to trial. He had people testify that he was working on being a better person, he got a plea deal and moved on with life. I got pushed away. Sisters were warned about allowing me to influence their children, I lost friends, I lost people I had known my whole life. My parents argued about what I had done, my mom thankfully wanted to protect me but my stepdad said it was my fault that I was being treated the way I was. I turned to drugs, a couple suicide attempts and basically imploded. This Stanford thing is all over and I keep crying. Some of it is solidarity, I know her pain (with the exception I remember the entire experience), and feeling there was no appropriate justice. I know what it feels like to be a victim but accused of having done something wrong, of making it happen. It's just really brought me down to a sad place reliving what happened and the treatment afterward. I just needed someone way back then to hug me and say it wasn't my fault, to say that I wasn't broken. 19 years later and I still hold this inside and sometimes stories break it open.  Sorry, just needed to get this out somewhere that hopefully there are those who can understand. It's been hard.
Fozziefu	Thank you.
Fozziefu	The skewed way they see and handle things has caused so many people so much pain. It's so sad.  
Fozziefu	I've never heard of exorcisms but I was told stories of possession to scare us out of doing things outside the lines. One sister told me one time that a witness girl in Africa was given apostate material and snuck the material into her room which invited Satan's demons, she became ill and acted out until she died. My mom used to tell me about a family member who had books that were inappropriate (I believe one was actually the Exorcist) and that things in her home began moving and that the only way they could keep her safe was removing all wordly possessions and walking through the house repeatedly saying "Jehovah". My family believed that the word Jehovah was so strong and could drive away demons that it was chanted in scary situations and when someone moved into a new home it was used to cleanse the area.  Man I feel so fucking crazy now that I read over this.
Fozziefu	I do, but I always make sure they understand that I know what I'm saying is crazy.  At first though I must admit it was a brainwash response. Like when you practice all those scenario's where you might get to share the truth with a friend, coworker, or neighbor. A friend pointed out how I was coming across as a recruiter still and after some time of convincing myself I wouldn't be possessed by demonic forces (one of the many fun ways I was kept in line) and working on courage I was able to correct them appropriately ending each sentence with "this is crazy fucking shit, right?" 
Fozziefu	Thank you. We've done a lot of Internet searches but it's hard sometimes to determine which things are beneficial and which are driven by a company wanting your money. We figured we would just reach out and see what others thought/did for a little direction. Appreciate the response!
Fozziefu	Filed bankruptcy. Now what? | Our family had overwhelming medical bills, no credit cards or loans, and successfully completed our bankruptcy. We had our creditor meeting and were informed several days ago it will be officially official in July (they have to give creditors 60 days to respond). What we need to figure out now is what the next step should be.  Our ultimate goal is to buy/build a home. We know that is a ways out since we now have a bankruptcy on our credit. Our attorney advised against credit cards unless they're the ones you pay up front of course, but that was really all the input he had. We are just hoping for a few credit building ideas that won't bury us somehow.  Thank you in advance.
Fozziefu	Lego Bed "Frame" | https://imgur.com/a/jCF6T  My son was gifted an abundance of Lego's for his birthday. We donated some to the different special education programs in our area. There was still quite a bit left for building so I set his full size mattress on wood pallets and built a Lego rail to run the length. I also wrapped indoor LED rope lights around the pallets to provide night lighting. It's strong enough that my husband can stand on it but not glued so it can be disassembled as needed or desired. He still has enough to build to his hearts content but has a pretty neat place to dream up new creations.
Fozziefu	It is a proper mattress, not a futon.
Fozziefu	I was a witness through the 80's and 90's and remember being told as a young child I needed to prepare for people to put a gun to my head and demand I renounce Jehovah. It's so scary the tactics they use. I am still screwed up from it, a lot of fear and anxiety I shouldn't have to live with. I just wish I could figure out how to leave it all behind and move on living a happier life. They have screwed up so many poor people. 
Fozziefu	Their New Location | So, I haven't been able to peruse this sub as much as I had several months ago. I'm sorry if this is something that was discussed to death previously, but, what is up with their move in New York? My dad is an electrician and went over there for several weeks to do a lot of work but was sworn to secrecy. My mom warned me not to pry, she's not even allowed to know. I don't live with them so no chance of overhearing anything or finding anything written. My parents have been getting really weird, like weirder than normal and I'm worried that something within the organization has caused it. They just went to the convention this weekend so I don't think it's the loyalty thing, I'm preparing myself for less communication which does hurt. I know I'm not important enough for them to drop their entire belief system and life. Are they building a bunker or ark up there in New York though? What's up?
Fozziefu	If my mom ever said not to pray I would be looking into possession or aliens. 
Fozziefu	http://imgur.com/gallery/j8Vp9DM  The gentlemen I have pointed out with poorly doodled red arrows is an active witness. How witnessy of him. There wasn't even anything mean posted either, several questioning why the convention was considered "news worthy" and then a couple links to youtube videos. I think the meanest thing was maybe someone referring to a brainwashing convention but really that doesn't exactly warrant being called a bigot I don't think.
Fozziefu	Because I'm still just chicken shit enough I created a different Facebook profile and posted the shunning video and worst convention ever video to the comments on the story of the convention. I saw it was covered on several other news sites as well so I just spread it around the best I could. I think I'm gonna keep my persona profile just in case I decide to share anything else or want to get "truthy" on some other pages too. 
Fozziefu	Not sure why my local new station is covering this. | Of course my grams thinks it came up in my Facebook feed because Jehovah misses me. I did get the same sick feeling as if an ex messaged me though so maybe.   http://www.kpax.com/story/32092650/jehovahs-witnesses-convention-returns-to-missoula?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook_KPAX-TV
Fozziefu	Someone fixed the JW anti-gay video...muahahaha | 
Fozziefu	Parental Contact During Hospitalization in Montana | My 11-year old son is currently a resident in a children's psychiatric hospital. He lives with autism as well as several other neurological disabilities and is on several medications. This is his third stay, first time at this particular facility. The purpose is to adjust medication and monitor him while addressing some behavioral things, nothing that would consider him a danger or limit family contact. He has been at the facility for two weeks now. The times for parents to call are between 9am-2pm Monday to Friday. I have called everyday, understanding that this is also the time they are in school and so contact may not happen at the time of the call. I have been told everyday that I will get a call back and as of today that has not happened. I have spoke with him 3 times, the first time was on day 4, I began to call staff to inquire how to contact him and the person I got on the phone got him even though it was after call time. On day 6 a nurse called to report my son was punched and put him on the phone when I mentioned my frustration that I can't contact him easily. On day 9 another nurse called to report another incident, I asked if he had received any messages that I had called (I only call once a day) and she put him on the phone after calling hours. A disability advocate has already spoke with them about the need to maintain regular contact and they agreed but have not followed through. I am waiting for a call from a supervisor but was informed that the hospital is removing the call in times completely and the children will only be able to talk to family twice a week, once one on one and once during family therapy.  I have searched and searched, called and asked questions and cannot get a direct answer about any laws that stipulate a certain amount of contact that a parent is allowed. Where can I find something that can help show that they need to provide more contact for families? Thank you for any and all information. EDIT: In my frustration of dealing with the hospital I spent my time trying to investigate any and every angle. I wasn't sure if there were laws that dictate the amount of contact a residential hospital facility is supposed to provide between a parent and child. Thank you for your comments and messages. I escalated to the organization the hospital is required to report to and who do the periodic inspections of the facility. After hearing what has been happening and what I was told about the new policy an advocate and attorney explained to the facility that the policy change would be a problem and that there would be more issues if they didn't help parents and children have regular contact. I have been able to speak with my son three times now. I am glad, and thankful, you were patient with me even though I asked a question that wasn't really appropriate for this reddit page. lol. 
Fozziefu	I did admit him per the advise of his doctor. I have full custody. I can go visit him once a week, on Sundays. We are 4 hours away so driving down often is difficult which is why phone contact is so important.  
Fozziefu	Thank you. 
Fozziefu	Thank you. 
Fozziefu	Ok, thank you. I just wasn't sure if there was a legal side to it. I will continue to escalate or just discharge him completely. 
Fozziefu	Yes, it's always been 6-7 and with credits when we filed we received at least $3,000. We could really use that to get clothes and brakes on the car but want to avoid legal issues if we wait and then file.
Fozziefu	4 kids, have always gotten $3-4,000
Fozziefu	I claim 7, Fed doesn't hardly take a dime.
Fozziefu	As far as the bankruptcy goes, can the figure the refund as income, since they were gonna take 75% anyway?  I guess this is my worry.
Fozziefu	I have talked with lawyer and all they want is the money to file bankruptcy first, they recommend filing now, rather than later.  But, if we do file now, they will get 75% of my tax return before it even gets to me.  This is not from a gov't agency, just expensive medical bills; two kidney surgery's and a gall stone removal.  We need time to gather all invoices and etc., to file bankruptcy anyway, so I thought by new year we should be able to do it, but would they take from the IRS of try to get it from my bank.... I figured bank. That's why we'll just cash the refund check.  Thanks 
Fozziefu	I have and all they want is the money to file bankruptcy first, they recommend filing now, rather than later.  But, if we do file now, they will get 75% of my tax return before it even gets to me.  
Fozziefu	Garnishing wages, is my tax refund in jeopardy? | I've recently gotten my wages garnished, overdue medical bills, we are barely able to make it; wife, 4 kids and myself can make it until we claim bankruptcy in Jan or Feb, but can they take my tax refund? We spoke with a bankruptcy attorney who said we should claim now to stop garnishments but we would lose any refunds we would receive for this year thus far. If we wait and get our refund and then file is that ok? In Montana, not sure what the laws are regarding this, any help is appreciated. EDIT: Added information
Fozziefu	Just wanted to say thank you to everyone on Reddit who helped my son have an amazing birthday this year!! You guys are awesome!! | 
Fozziefu	Thanks for all the Reddit love!! We are currently attempting to organize it somehow and then I'll get pictures. For those asking about donations I wanted to let you know that has been discussed. He wants to build the sets and make one big amazing creation, then we will break it down and start with donating to the special education programs and children's services. The Lego company and several Legoland locations sent cards and Lego's, he even got a card from Lego headquarters in Denmark. This was so far beyond anything I could ever hope for or dream of for him. The smile on his face was permanent all day yesterday and today his mind is swirling with possibilities. He said he has so many friends and that brought me to tears for the thousandth time in 24 hours. He considers each person a friend, even those who didn't send Lego's and just sent a card. He needed this and I will be eternally greatful he was given this experience. 
Fozziefu	I did not contact them so I assume they saw the post or someone else contacted them. It was a really awesome surprise!
Fozziefu	He is very appreciative and knows this is once in a lifetime experience.  Edit- finished sentence
Fozziefu	Sorry it's not more but sent $2.00 via Paypal. Congrats!!
Fozziefu	My whole family is crossing fingers and toes. Here we go...
Fozziefu	Viral Lego Project | 
Fozziefu	I did back post it back on the 1st. Several people helped from here, it was awesome. 
Fozziefu	I can't believe how it turned out. I posted on Reddit and Facebook thinking not many people would be willing to help out. It's been amazing, I love seeing him so excited and happy. We are setting everything aside so he can open it on his birthday and it's going to be better than I ever could have imagined. Thank you so much for your help!! :-D
Fozziefu	That is so awesome thank you!! :-)
Fozziefu	Help Making My Son's Birthday Special | [removed]
Fozziefu	Will do!!
Fozziefu	I didn't know if many people would respond so I figured if I asked early I may have time to collect fifty cards. I'm hiding anything that comes early and giving them to him on his birthday. I will repost closer to his birthday. :-)
Fozziefu	Will do! Thank you!!
Fozziefu	If you have a set you're willing to part with that would be awesome! Thank you!!
Fozziefu	[Request] To Make My Sons Birthday Special | Here is my [family](http://imgur.com/L5T96y2) (from a previous post I made during Christmas time). Our son, Zechariah, lives with autism as well as a host of sensory and behavioral accessories. He is a big kid for his age, at 10 years-old he is 5 feet 1 inch, which can be deceiving to some adults and kids when they meet him, he is developmentally delayed and is a lovable 5 year old at heart. He doesn't have any friends, we have been home schooling him due to some issues at school that exasperated his behavioral difficulties so his world, sadly, is pretty small and limited. He tries to play with others but a lot of kids have a hard time understanding him and some his personality nuances. He has gone a year without any hospitalizations which is another awesome reason to celebrate and help him feel the love from everyone.  I have seen other parents get support helping their kids have an awesome birthday and so I'm hoping for a little of that love for him as well. His birthday is August 18th, I'm asking early in hopes that I can get maybe fifty cards in the mail to surprise him with at his birthday. There is one minor addition though; Zechariah had said last year it would be neat if he had a birthday party and the kids each brought a Lego piece he could use to make something he could take a picture of to send in to Lego magazine. Unfortunately, none of the kids we invited (outside of his sisters and a few cousins) came to his party. It has always been that way so I'm hoping you would be willing to help make this year special for him. If you happen to have a single Lego piece laying around you're willing to part with and could toss it in the card that would be so cool. I know this is out of the ordinary but we are under some strict financial budgeting and won't be able to do much for him this year. Getting some cards to help him feel special on his birthday would help all of our hearts feel happy. He has two sisters that feel sad every year that his birthday is different than theirs and are asking some of the kids in their classes to send a birthday card too. Please private message me for an address. If you are unable, or uninterested, no worries but if you know someone who may please feel free to share this with them.  UPDATE: Thank you so much everyone! I posted here and on Facebook hoping between the two I would collect 50 cards for my son and it got so much bigger than that. I am so deeply grateful to you all! He will finally have an amazing birthday and see all the good from people around the world! http://flatheadbeacon.com/2015/06/09/building-a-birthday-for-zech/
Fozziefu	Thank you for the idea!!
Fozziefu	[request] To Make My Sons Birthday Special (also posted in r/randomkindness) | [removed]
Fozziefu	Could have been an after school special.
Fozziefu	I've been told this is a preauricular sinus (or pit). When I cry tears drain out of it along with my tear ducts and I swear a couple times I've felt air come out when exhaling. I've never met or spoke to anyone else with one. I'm wondering who else has one and does yours cry? | 
Fozziefu	Never had anything stinky come out thankfully. 
Fozziefu	Not really pain, it's more like an annoying itch in my head near my ear. 
Fozziefu	Nothing. I've tried to see if I could purposely get air to come out but have not been successful. The few times I thought it did was weird, as I exhaled I could hear something like wind rushing past my ear but I was inside and it only happened when I was breathing out.  
Fozziefu	It's been that way my whole life and doctors have never seemed worried. It only happens when I cry and, I believe, it was explained to my mom that it's because it's connected to my sinuses. 
Fozziefu	Does it leak just whenever or when you're eyes are watering?
Fozziefu	Mines on the right too!! Yay, nice to meet you! :-)
Fozziefu	I considered that too but learned not to cover it. When I was in grade school, probably 3rd grade, I used it as show and tell. Everyone spent weeks trying to make me cry to see it in work. So I tried hiding it with that fake putty skin. Blocking it was a mistake. 
Fozziefu	Not really. I've had the white residue from what I assume would be the drying up of tears but that's it, no sleepy eye boogers on my ear.
Fozziefu	Update posted above. We got to tell him nope! :-)
Fozziefu	Today's Maddness | I honestly just need to vent.  My husband was raised Catholic, I was raised Jehovah's Witness. When we were both old enough we ran away from them and have been living happily fulfilled lives without any kind of god or religious red tape. About a year ago my husband was laid off and our finances went down the toilet. When he did find work again the pay was a fraction of what he had made before. We are struggling and barely making it month to month. I stay home and care for as well as home school our special needs son which makes working outside the home nearly impossible. I am taking college classes but won't have a degree for a while yet and even then working is dependent on the care we can find for our son. This summer my father in law wanted to get our 3 older kids signed up for summer programs to help keep them busy. I got all the forms filled out for swimming lessons and my 9-year-old daughter was hoping to go to a volleyball plus basketball camp. My FIL stopped by to pick everything up and asked about a vacation bible school offered by his church. I declined and we continued the conversation. As we talked he asked about some of the extras coming up we'll probably need some help with like yearly vehicle registration and my husbands work-boots which just split all the seams. Everything seemed fine and he left. I just got a call from him, since apparently he was more comfortable doing this over the phone rather than in person. I was told that my children need spirituality and that by not encouraging and making the right choices for them I am letting them down as a mother. I was also told that if I agree to have them go to the bible school he will help us pay for the extras we honestly don't have the money for.  I feel like I'm being held hostage. I am 33 f'n years old.  I was so angry I started crying, I really tried not to, apparently I'm being dramatic.  So...it looks like my vehicle will have expired registration and my husband will have to tape his boots shut. The part honestly that bothers me the most though is that my daughter won't get to do the one thing she was excited for. I know it's a luxury, I know she will survive without. It just seems like he gave it and is now taking it away.  It's all so ludicrous.  I know this is not life changing, I know this really only is my problem affecting myself. Like I said, I just needed to vent a little. Thanks.  EDIT: You guys, I can't express my appreciation and emotion properly right now. I honestly posted this just needing to get the crap out while feeling defeated. I understand the option to just send them and take the money is there but I feel wrong doing that, I feel like I'm compromising my beliefs and values for someone else. I also don't like the message that would send to my children; I don't want them to think they can do things that feel wrong if it helps you financially.  My husbands boots are a size 10 1/2. I'm not going to hold anyone to getting boots or helping out with the registration. I do so love the thought though, the fact that I am getting more hope and help here than from family is amazing. You guys are all kick ass and thank you!!! EDIT 2: To abide by subreddit rules the gofundme link has been removed. You all helped me feel not so alone and defeated today, thank you so very very much.   UPDATE: Last night around 9pm my husband and I spoke with FIL and let him know that we were declining his proposal. He was upset, didn't understand why we would have such a problem with something so innocent, I kept my cool and explained that it is our job to raise our kids, I had to stay away from the long debate about calling the bible (or Catholicism in general) innocent. We are to prepare them for the world and that won't always coincide with what everyone believes. He asked how we planned on getting through the next month of extra expenses and we explained that a group of friends who agree with our decision stepped up to help. He didn't say much after that, we probably won't hear from him for a while. It's sad, I really wish they could all accept the fact that our kids are fine and just focus on enjoying time with them while they are young instead of focusing on whether or not we are indoctrinating them. I can't express how much gratitude I have for everyone's support. I was not expecting anything like this yesterday when I sat down at my computer and angrily typed. I have felt for a very long time that people can just be good without a book or tablets or invisible force fields telling them to, you all reinforced that incredibly and I ended my day able to stick to my decision and be comfortable that things would be handled. You are all amazing. Thank you tremendously!!! 
Fozziefu	I'm overwhelmed and posted an edit to address everyone I hope. Thank you all so very much!!
Fozziefu	I had to remove the links. I was worried people would think that but glad I got it reversed. 
Fozziefu	That is awesome, thank you for the info.
Fozziefu	It's being fixed. 
Fozziefu	Submitted a selfie! I am a 33 year old stay at home mom looking to finally get a degree and I LOVE science but am poor at math. I feel like my inability to understand math will hold me back. What should I do?
Fozziefu	Where's the Love? | So, my mom raised myself and my four younger brothers and sisters as witnesses. We were to be the fourth generation of witnesses in our family...yay? Well, there's only one of us still in, my youngest brother. I have two sisters who both announced they were engaged the end of last year, one to a guy after 7 years of dating, the other to a girl after 4 years of dating. The beginning of this year our youngest brother announced his engagement to a girl he has been dating for a couple of months. My mom jumped on Facebook and started bragging about his engagement and how excited she is to have his beautiful girlfriend joining the family. I have been married for 10 years and she has never acted that excited about my marriage, I don't even think she got this excited when I had kids.  We were all upset by her obvious singling out and confronted her about it. She decided to focus on my sister being a lesbian, she constantly kept calling it my sisters "sin" and that it was an "imperfect" part of her. She then compared it to pedophilia and bestiality to which my sister promptly lost her shit.  As a mother I will never understand picking religion over your own child. It breaks my heart. My sister told my mom that if she believes so strongly that we are all going to die while she gets to live it up in paradise then she may want to get her time in with us now.  This is why I am atheist, witnesses convinced me of it. I raise my children that love is the most important thing you can do in life. It's sad they don't see their grandmother practicing this. In fact, she has little to nothing to do with my kids which is a crime because they are pretty f'n adorable. I wish I could figure out the epiphany words, the magic sentence that when strung together makes my mother go "oh shit, I've made so many poor decisions and I am so sorry I allowed the governing body and elders to influence me so strongly that I became less mother and more witness."    *sigh* She keeps losing more of us, it was just that we didn't go to meetings with her, then we celebrated holidays, then we started lives with "worldly" people, and now we've had it with her distancing herself further and further yet acting and treating us like it's our fault.  I think I'm leaving my mom. It hurts but it hurts more knowing she doesn't see me as her daughter who works hard raising four kids and is full of love and bright happy things. Instead I am the apostate heathen, I am raising little apostates and am full of sin. I guess it's a good thing I've had a lot of practice with not having her when I feel like I need her. Sorry, just needed to get this out. It's been tying me up for a while now. 
Fozziefu	Oh...well then no thank you.

Fozziefu	I'm surprised they wished you luck. Gonna be facing their own judicial committee for that one!! What a-holes! 
Fozziefu	HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! :-)
Fozziefu	"We don't need a holiday to give gifts" | I heard this so much growing up it's sickening. It would have maybe made sense if I had in fact received gifts any time at all. I do, however, have memories of jealousy watching kids exchange Christmas family tales and comparing their haul of toys. When I finally was out, no longer attending meetings, I swore my kids would have an awesome holiday everytime forever. I have four kids, 10-year old son and three daughters 9 years, 6 years, and 7 months. My son is special needs so holidays can be a little difficult for him. Regardless of all the crap, my crap, my husbands families crap, and my sons difficulties I can't help but be so thankful that I'm free to watch my kids enjoy this. The excitement and frenzy, the overwhelming joy of receiving something they've been eyeing for months, and the happiness of sharing that innocent love and joy with others. They have no fear that everyone they know at school is going to get exterminated at any moment, no worries they're not living up to the letter of the law. They are being kids and that is the best thing I could ever get on Christmas, the sound of my children's happiness and laughter. To all of you MERRY CHRISTMAS. I wish I could invite every one of you to my home for a huge feast and holiday revelry. I hope your day is filled with love and laughter. Thank you for being there, I know I have not been on here as long as others but the support I've received in this short amount of time has been amazing. Your strength and awesomeness would make Thor jealous :-D. Have a hell of a day heathens!! <3 
Fozziefu	I know at least 2 people who've committed suicide that was related to issues with JW's. One of them spent his teenage years trying to get through a sexual assault, it overwhelmed him when he was in his twenties. I miss him.
Fozziefu	How did you get in? | I was born into a family of JW's. My great-grandma signed us all up when she started bible studies when my grandma was pretty little. My grandma was baptized at 14. My mom was baptized at 15 but stepped away at 18. She was "inactive" but not disfellowshipped. She got married, had me and moved to Germany (from the U.S.). When I was only a month old she got lost driving around the town we lived in and suddenly recognized a Kingdom Hall and saw it as being called back. She started bible studies again and here we are. My family has lived in the same small town in Montana for generations. When I was 4 we moved back to the states and to my family. I still see witnesses who want to stop me and talk about my great grandma being the one who showed them the truth. She passed when I was 14, car accident on her way to meet up for service, but that's off topic. Does anyone else know how your family got in? 
Fozziefu	Welcome!! I just got into Reddit a month ago so don't feel too out of the loop. A lot of us can relate to the depression and anxiety. My mom, step dad, grandma, and youngest brother are still in. I've been out about 13 years after being born in. Thanks for sharing!!  
Fozziefu	We never had any traditions. We couldn't watch TV because it was all Christmas stuff so we would just sit around. I hated it when my great-grandma would suggest service on Christmas Day. She thought it was perfect because almost everyone would be home. 
Fozziefu	My husband struggled with having to remember I was basically the equivalent of a five year old on holidays. It looks like Christmas or Halloween has thrown up on our house, inside and out. He finds it comical that after 13 years I still have a hard time saying "happy/merry (insert holiday)", I'll thank them or some awkward comment or gesture but can't always choke that out. I also deal with some depression during birthdays and holidays which can be rough. I wish I could say it gets easier, parts do but at least for me I'm still trying to find balance and being comfortable. A handbook would have been so nice lol. 
Fozziefu	Depleting Christmas Spirit | Around holidays and my birthday I have a couple weeks of excitement and being all about the upcoming event but right before go time I deflate. I think part of it is making plans with my husbands family, also I get jealous, maybe, that I'm doing all of these things in my adult years and don't have the memories I get to hear he and his family relive. I love seeing my kids' exciment, I love giving them magical and fun memories. I just wish inside I was more "holly jolly." 
Fozziefu	My mom has invited me every year forever. I know if I ever went she would consider it an opening and then I would get magazines every week and offers for bible studies. I do what I can to avoid giving anyone hope I'll be back. 
Fozziefu	Facebook post | A girl I know who's still in just posted this status, "Proof we have the Truth! They are changing more bibles to follow the NWT. Praise Jehovah, let your name be sanctified, let your kingdom come to Earth." And this link,   http://clevelandbanner.com/bookmark/16962037/article-WRIGHT%20WAY-%20A%20New%20King%20James%20Bible-#.VJcyv7RPuyA.facebook  I of course don't comment. It's kind of weird how angry this made me though, seems minimal to encourage the list of things I wanted to rant about on her page. The article says nothing about taking on the practices of Witnesses, just using the name Jehovah.
Fozziefu	Oh snap its 19-14 | Anyone watched or going to watch the movie "Truth Be Told?" 
Fozziefu	That was a promo I believe. The full movie was made available today. 
Fozziefu	Beautifully put!! 
Fozziefu	I came across this. It references several places that the earthly organization is mentioned. I remember something about it too but can't remember if it was scripture or other random book.  http://www.witness-outreach.com/Organization.html
Fozziefu	I need to find a copy of that one. Someone else mentioned it and I completely forgot the name. Thank you for reminding me!!
Fozziefu	They're pretty good at responding to inquiries. Maybe send them a message or post a comment. I failed searching to see what was cut out.
Fozziefu	I'm interested in what my husband thinks. He was raised Catholic but is non-practicing. I have told him stories and he's heard my mom make some pretty batty comments but I don't know if he understands the depth of being raised a JW.

izad96	Nothing say space like a plastic figma straps to a rocket.
izad96	Nice, my grandma would love this.
izad96	Bruh, awesome and fun vid. Keep it up.
izad96	Really nice!
izad96	I really like this kind of lineless art. Glad to have someone making those for vocaloids
izad96	Pretty good. Do u publish your works on deviantart or any similar site?
izad96	Decent melody you got there. Really like the string sounds (cello?). Miku sounds a bit buried and her English vb is well known to have poor pronunciation, so you need to work more on make her voice clear and stand out more. Overall the composition is ok. Keep it up.
izad96	Thanks for writing =w=b
izad96	Interesting concept of a show, and definitely trippy.
izad96	Very nice!
izad96	Nice, thanks for sharing.
izad96	I always missed :(. Does LamazeP do this often? What did he/she do during the stream?
izad96	Heart....... right? We're talking about large heart right???? @_@ XD 
izad96	Thanks for sharing. I've been wanting to purchase Gumi English.
izad96	The facial design is cute. Any idea who the artist is?
izad96	Miku is pleased, lol. That's one cool looking mixer you got there.
izad96	Finally done my World is Mine remix! | 
izad96	Sure. I added the link in the description.
izad96	Enjoy :D
izad96	Original collab with a friend! | 
izad96	Pretty good. Keep it up :)
izad96	Yes, if I had to pick a name from this sub, it definitely KonpeitoKiss. I'm glad this active member is recognized. Keep it up KonpeitoKiss and also all other members.
izad96	Hey, I'm a producer as well. Wrote a couple of vocaloid originals, in my mother language. tbh I still suck at writing. Would love to help you writing English lyric, but kinda busy this time of the year. What I could suggest is searching for other amateur producer on YT or SC and maybe drop them a comment or message.
izad96	Miku: Hmmm its that soooooooooooooooooooooooooo? *pull out axe*
izad96	Check out my remix of World Is Mine | 
izad96	It really helps to study how a human voice works. A lot of parameter is changing when a human sing. To make a vocaloid sound realistic is to mimic this changes. The most important parameter for a realistic singing is the pitch bend. You have to tweak it a lot to mimic real singer. Other parameter is important as well. The key is to know how human sing, and try to replicate it. Some reason why vocaloid sound robotic is because they are not fine tuned. The default pitch bend in vocaloid editor shift rather drastically, so thats why they sound so choppy and robotic. I'm no pro, but this is what I understand when I tune vocaloids. 
izad96	This is a work in progress. I will finish it later. Stay tuned if you want.
izad96	I will post again once i finished it.
izad96	Composition-wise, you are ok. Keep producing, learn the way of EDM lol. I'm no pro myself but it always help me to constantly work on my production. Also, you might want to increase the final volume a bit, since it is a bit below standard. Cheers :D
izad96	I have heard of these noises that you are referring too, but it never bothered me, since it is hardly audible, to me at least. Every now and then, music producers like to put glitches as sound effects in their track, for that subtle extra touch. It was of course meant to add more more interest into the song, but in your case, its the other way around. And since its something the original producer add into the song, we can expect all the version to be the same.
izad96	Ah fellow producer :) . Its OK in my book. 
izad96	Vocaloid inspired me to compose music and share it with the world. The vocaloid music scene is and endless chain of inspiration. 1 person works inspires others and so on. Vocaloid really encourage me to just express my view of the world and composing vocaloid music distract me from this life that can get too hectic sometimes. 
izad96	I actually don't have the VSQX, so I use the original vocal instead. I had to chop a lot of part since the instrumental is in triplet beat, while the vocal is in standard beat.
izad96	Western Pop version of Last Night, Good Night | 
izad96	Other workaround is to combine those multiple wav files. For example, using Audacity. The con is you can't mute/solo the track individually.
izad96	Vocaloid Editors can import sounds file, but only in .wav format. If you meant you can't import your backing music, make sure that it is in the right format. I hope this answer your question, as I'm still confused with the question. Do let me know it that is not what you are asking for.
izad96	If you're talking about vocaloid progressive/uplifting/emotional trance, check out JrHarbort at https://www.youtube.com/user/jrharbort . Also check me out at https://www.youtube.com/user/thecyrax96 . I make vocaloid trance as well :3
izad96	Hey. I'm not really familiar with Oliver, but i think the tuning could use more work. I can't really make out the word without referring to the lyric. The vocal sounds dry, I assuming you haven't apply any effects to it. Effects such as distortion, reverb and equalization are important to make the vocal interesting and pro-sounding. The most important thing in any vocaloid cover is the fine-tuning. Make sure that each word is intelligible and learn the pitch curve of a real person singing so you can imitate in your cover. I hope that helps.  
izad96	My new track "Olympus" | 
izad96	System Of A Down - Chop Suey! ft YOHIOloid 【Trance Remix】 | 
izad96	Hey op, I'm a self-publish voca-P, almost 2 years in the scene. I'm more of a guitar player, but when it comes to chord progression, playing songs is one of the best way to learn it, regardless of instrument. In time, you'll see a pattern and realise that artists have been using similar progression for decades. Play around with the piano regularly to get inspiration for your melody. For song structure, it depends on what genre are you planning to compose, mostly watch tutorial which can be found on youtube. Collaboration is nice and really ease the burden, but if you're like me, want to do everything by myself, better start learning to write lyrics, something which I still has a lot to learn. For the instrumental, get yourself a digital audio workstation and learn to record, or opt for the virtual studio option(can ask me for more detail). Yeah its a lot of thing to learn and can be overwhelming at first, but its fun and knowing that other people enjoys the song that you make is the greatest gift of all.

izad96	Thanks :) . Honestly, I also constantly lack motivation, i have a lot of track that I cannot finish, lyric that I can't write. The key is to keep on taking small step everyday.
izad96	Thanks :) . I started playing around with trance in 2014. I only started vocaloiding in 2015 and here I am. I still have a long way ahead of me. A pleasure to meet other trance voca-p :D. Maybe you can share with me your stuff.
izad96	Hey I like orchestral stuff too, and I'm planning to compose a vocaloid orchestral trance in the future, its a beautiful mix :) . I use FL Studio to compose my track and also Vocaloid Editor.
izad96	Hey thanks :)
whatshisfaceboy	What is the most childish thing you have ever witnessed an adult do? | 
whatshisfaceboy	"I'm here too! Look at me! Hey guys!!"
whatshisfaceboy	This is a very uplifting story amongst all the horrible ones! Thanks!  Also.... can I hang out with you guys next time?
whatshisfaceboy	Double if it is only their kid looking at clouds during the game.
whatshisfaceboy	Childish or trashy? You be the judge!
whatshisfaceboy	Well that's just great parenting at work. /s
whatshisfaceboy	As a high school teacher myself... I could totally see a student pulling that crap.
whatshisfaceboy	Were you the teacher... or another student? Either way.
whatshisfaceboy	Tan, green, and... other color?
whatshisfaceboy	Me too! Either they hit it over the fence, or way far to the left. Very much me time as a tee-ball outfielder.
whatshisfaceboy	I didn't even... *sigh*
whatshisfaceboy	Yup. Pretty much exactly that.
whatshisfaceboy	That just makes it ten times worse!
whatshisfaceboy	Wow yeah... was it at least a good concert?
whatshisfaceboy	What's a number voice? Are you a robot?
whatshisfaceboy	Wow.
whatshisfaceboy	*Fucking Lisa*.
whatshisfaceboy	Maybe they did?
whatshisfaceboy	He should go pro
whatshisfaceboy	Ah, incels.
whatshisfaceboy	Which she also quit from a few weeks after that!
whatshisfaceboy	Ummmmm........
whatshisfaceboy	Uh... quality parenting right there?
whatshisfaceboy	Holy shit lol
whatshisfaceboy	Yeah, it was a quick edit. Corrected nicely.
whatshisfaceboy	Nice ninja edit!
whatshisfaceboy	He didnt want the teacher to see her black eye.
whatshisfaceboy	Well, *technically*...
whatshisfaceboy	Would hate to see this woman driving in NYC, London, or Istanbul... or anywhere for that matter.
whatshisfaceboy	A... *reef* blower?
whatshisfaceboy	Holee bejesus.
whatshisfaceboy	A bit of context? Who is 'he'?
whatshisfaceboy	And trashy wins!
whatshisfaceboy	Nice try.
whatshisfaceboy	Triggered.
whatshisfaceboy	Ah ok. 
whatshisfaceboy	That is quite offensive!
whatshisfaceboy	This was also featured on a crime documentary show on Netflix.
whatshisfaceboy	Well, in his defence... I have had some drunken cravings myself.
whatshisfaceboy	When you were working on Mythbusters, which myth did you really not enjoy doing?
whatshisfaceboy	I think that is a great way to motivate! Anything that is an extra incentive for the students works. I threw a pizza party for my MUN team last year.  The only thing I could see it as posing any kind of issue with administration would be liability. What if you injure yourself? You could always make a video of you doing a cartwheel out of school property to avoid that!

whatshisfaceboy	It makes sense... if you pretend that Alien vs Predator never happened. Which it totally did, since there was a second one... And yet, in Predator 2 there were alien skulls on the ship. So maybe it does make more sense to pretend that Covenant doesn't.
whatshisfaceboy	I am a *massive* fan of the Aliens franchise. Seriously though... **SPOILER ALERT**  So with the new Alien flick, we learn that David actually biologically engineered the Xenomorphs from a mutating virus that takes on the characteristics of whatever the host is. Right, works well. Prometheus was set in 2093 AD, Covenant in 2104 AD, Alien in 2122 AD... etc.  Here is the timeline plot fuck.   *Alien vs. Predator was set in 2004*.  How could a species that was engineered by an android that **did not exist** be over a century in the past?  I do realize there are other pieces to the lore, but sticking with only the movies in which Aliens appear, this pisses me off.

whatshisfaceboy	The only thing I would want from Netflix at this point... is a filter system. Not just categories and sub genres.

When you look at action, half of the movies are also in sci-fi.  Edit: A letter

Mirenithil	80s kids of Reddit, what were some of the best things about being an 80s kid? | 
Mirenithil	The power of just not giving a fuck is real. Honestly, though, nobody's ever commented on them to me. Then again, I'm out of high school.
Mirenithil	I really hope this is the parody it seems to be.
Mirenithil	Nah, man. All we want to do is eat your brains. We're not unreasonable, I mean no one's gonna eat your eyes.
Mirenithil	Puns based on what type of employment it is, maybe?
Mirenithil	Star Warts. It's now a documentary about the particular health and sanitation problems and challenges posed by the closed environments of deep space spaceports.
Mirenithil	I wonder what year I last used a rotary phone in. I'd guess maybe 1987 or so at the latest. It took the changeover to touch tone phones a while to happen. I remember how awesome I thought touch tone phones were.
Mirenithil	This. On the bright side, if my dining companion(s) want the guac/avocado my dish came with, it is theirs.
Mirenithil	This strongly reminds me of Fisher Price toys of the 40s/50s. The "Japan" stamp makes me inclined to think it's an original and not a reproduction. It's in excellent shape if it really is that old. Was there anything else in that box of toys of that age?
Mirenithil	Instructions unclear, entire can of turtle wax used, buttcheeks still not gleaming
Mirenithil	Right? I was so surprised it didn't swim away. Is this possibly a game it actually enjoys? (how awesome would that be, though?) or is it just hanging out in the jar afterwards because it likes being in a confined (thus safe) space?
Mirenithil	Aloha from Maui. Yeah, the cost of living here sucks and the island is tourist central from December through about July/August, but the slow time of the year (now through Dec) is awesome, the beaches are great, the people are awesome ("live aloha" isn't just something made up for tourism purposes) and the natural beauty is off the charts. The music is outstanding, too. It's too bad Hawaiian music isn't more widely known; it really deserves to be. I suggest Ekolu, Fiji, and Laga Savea as modern-style acts and Keali'i Reichel for a more oldschool sound.
Mirenithil	The anthrax scare that followed only a couple weeks or so after 9-11 and what an enormous impact it had in getting people to finally agree to pass the "Patriot" Act
Mirenithil	Aunt Flo is paying me a visit. I like Shark Week, too.

Mirenithil	I would love so much more of Pink Floyd's catalog if only the lyrics of so many of those beautiful, beautiful songs weren't so often such downers. 
Mirenithil	Everyone tends to assume it's always pride/ego causing the problem, but there is another possibility, too. Some abused kids grow up in homes where it is dangerous to ever admit you made a mistake, because their parents will beat them for it. There are homes out there where kids are not allowed to make even innocent kid mistakes without severe punishment. It can be extraordinarily difficult to admit even to yourself that you're wrong, much less admit it to other people, for people who grow up in a home like this.
Mirenithil	Because enough years have passed that my memory is fuzzy on the details and this is important enough that I want to make sure they are exactly right, I'm not going to try to write out what I remember. Instead, here's a link to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks) as a good starting place. 
Mirenithil	I was 25 at the time, so what I wrote is a recollection of my experience of it at the time. I really hope someone has written about it because it is a very important topic, but I don't know of anything offhand to suggest since I didn't learn about it that way. Maybe someone else who sees this can recommend something?
Mirenithil	Adam Savage. He is way too awesome for the world to ever lose.
Mirenithil	In Hawaii, everybody.
Mirenithil	Porn can also have unfortunate side effects. It is possible to become so accustomed to seeing perfect 10s in porn that you can actually have performance problems in the bedroom with your IRL partner who isn't a 10. You can't help but compare your partner to the perfect women you see all the time in porn. Imagine if your partner constantly compared you to the perfect men she sees in porn, and you see the problem.
Mirenithil	Jensen Ackles makes bow legs look good.
Mirenithil	Maybe not 'disgusting' per se, but Dr Pepper tastes so much like medicine to me that I avoid it.
Mirenithil	Thank you for saying that. I have a fingerprint sized splotch of vitiligo on my cheek and nowhere else on my body, and I've always been pretty conscious of it.
Mirenithil	Like this. [This is a 9-second video showing the guy we've been talking about walking towards the camera.](https://youtu.be/nGIxViM2vcY)

Mirenithil	Good old Viking Kittens, one of the earliest viral videos, which is older than Youtube. [Turn on your sound and scroll down a bit](http://syntheticx.com/archive/2012/04/viking-kittens-returns)
Mirenithil	The Magical Trevor videos are marvelous. [The first one](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/181469)   And the [second](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/216789)  Two are enough to start; there are more Magical Trevor videos if you want to google them. You may want to watch them on a site that endlessly loops them because that was the way they were originally shown back in the day.
Mirenithil	I don't remember the video, but I sure remember that song. Ooh. Remember Magical Trevor? gonna post it to this thread. 
Mirenithil	Amadeus comes to mind.
Mirenithil	Sounds like a description of the Hindu idea of the different yugas (ages of the world.) The blissful, peaceful one, followed by a shorter not so nice one, followed by an even shorter still era of really bad times, rinse and repeat.
Mirenithil	I don't think there is one, to be honest. If there was going to be an end-of-the-world scenario, I think it would have happened during the time of the major famine that was immediately followed by the bubonic plague in was it the 14th century?
Mirenithil	I notice that they didn't also thank god for giving them the disease or accident that caused them to need the operation in the first place.

Mirenithil	The sound of people eating loudly, also talking with food in their mouths.
Mirenithil	I talked about moving to Hawaii for eight years before circumstances aligned to let me actually do it in 2006. I've been here ever since and couldn't be happier.
Mirenithil	That's what happens when the programmers get drunk. Same with camels. Giant lumps to store water, really? and have you even seen the insides of their mouths? I want some of what the programmers were having.

Mirenithil	One page of a book from 1440 along with its provenance. It's from the era books were still being handwritten instead of printed, and has some small illuminated letters. It was $1. [Three pictures here. ](https://imgur.com/a/6y7Zu)
Mirenithil	There's a weird easter egg in the sim where these flying bugs work together to make delicious sweet stuff called honey. For some reason, the fact that it's made by flying bugs doesn't weird/gross people out. I think that was a programmer oversight.

Mirenithil	Def Leppard
Mirenithil	I think it's normal that we all tend to think we have the world really figured out by the time we're in our late teens. We are *so certain* that know what's what, we are so sure we know the real score, and that produces a filter we don't even know we have that we tend to (harshly) judge other people through at that age. Adult life has been a process of gradually destroying that certainty and those filters, of coming to the realization that there is very little in life that is actually black-and-white. Most things are in shades of gray, and context is very relevant to each specific situation. My 'opponents' are people in the same way I am; they've done things they're proud of and things they're not so proud of, they have favorite foods and movies, and like me, they have shortcomings and strengths. They're going through the process of just being human, too. Yes, there are psychopaths out there and they need to be accounted for, but as the old saying goes, never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by inexperience, ignorance, stupidity, immaturity, or other factors not immediately visible like pain/trauma/other difficulties in their lives. Compassion and kindness are the most important things in the world to me now, not being 'right' or having 'all the answers' - I'm not sure that's even possible. 
Mirenithil	Holy smokes, congratulations. I hope your post gets upvoted to the skies.
Mirenithil	And citrus tree trunks are never wide enough for a person to realistically actually hide behind, so this confuzzles me
Mirenithil	I got a new stepladder and while using it wondered if it would be strong enough to support me. I was around 185 or so pounds at the time and I immediately realized that of course it would be designed to easily hold that kind of weight and more, but the fact that the thought occurred to me at all was a clear signal that change needed to happen. That was 46 pounds ago and counting.

Mirenithil	I like some of the new age ones. I'd pick this one, and wouldn't it be great if it were actually even true: The 'basic reality' in this one is that we are all actually immortal, eternally safe forever in a type of heaven of unending bliss. For entertainment, there is an infinite variety of worlds to choose from to have any experience you could ever wish for. An incarnation is essentially the same thing as starting a new character in a video game. Want to experience what it's like to be rich and powerful? You can! You simply incarnate on a planet in a place that will give you the exact experience you want. Maybe your next lifetime is that of being a famous musician, etc. Perhaps after a while all these easy lifetimes of fortune and fame start to be a little boring, though, so you choose to play the game on a harder difficulty setting - be just an ordinary person in an ordinary town working to make ends meet. Maybe you eventually decide to play the game on an ultra hardcore difficulty setting to find out, for example, what it's like to starve to death at age four in a poverty-stricken place and time. No matter what experiences you choose to have in life (in-game,) though, 'death' isn't real - you just transition back to the eternal, unchangeable bliss-joy of actual reality. You can stay there for a while to relax, or you can go incarnate again as you like. Maybe this time you pick a planet that has wildly different laws of physics than earth does, etc. It's all a simulation, so there are no physical limitations to what you can experience. Want a lifetime where magic is as real and ordinary as wifi is to us? You can do that.
Mirenithil	I'm not sure that's even possible at this point. I speculate that the lawsuits from this are going to be epic enough to torpedo the company no matter what at this point - unless the gov steps in and treats Experian like it's above the law.
Mirenithil	I want to watch them play mario kart against each other
Mirenithil	heh, I can't do it either. I've long since given up thinking it'll ever click for me. The weird thing is that I have no problems whatsoever with the cardinal directions and can read a map totally fine. Just don't say 'turn left' without giving me a chance to look at my hands first...
Mirenithil	No, absolutely not. I think the idea is dangerous, in fact, because it can and does drive people to break it off with people who are actually good matches due to the fact that they're not 100% perfect (no person on earth is.) The idea of soulmates can also make people stay in relationships that they would be much better off leaving. It also can and does make people not give excellent potential matches a chance if there isn't that breathtaking intense spark right off the bat that I think so many people just expect to have when they meet their soulmate. It can take time to fall in love with someone.
Mirenithil	Back in my bookstore days the manager genuinely thought I missed a day of work because I was so sick I forgot to call in, and wasn't upset about it. (I'd been sick with the bug that was going around a couple days before that.) I actually did just forget I was on that day, and it was the only time in my 5+ years with that company that I did. It was such a small thing, but he gained my respect at that moment like nothing else.
Mirenithil	I worked as a service writer in a garage for a number of years several years ago. If you are in the USA, look for AAA approved garages where all the techs have their ASE certification. This is my own rule of thumb for finding a place to have work done on my car. I also test new garages before I let them work on my car by listening to what they have to say about the particular problem that brought me in in the first place as a type of BS detection test, and never once have any of them tried to give me the run-around or BS me. They have always told it like it is to someone they could not possibly have known was a former service writer. 
Mirenithil	I'll tell you. Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the stairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the street from Jerry's Bait shop (you know the place) well anyway, back then life was going swell and everything was just
Mirenithil	I used to work as a service writer in a garage with a tech whose proficiency with profanity was truly an art. He was fluidly expressive with a constant stream of the most colorful and above all original arrangements of curses and invective, and the best thing was that he was never loud or angry about it. It was just his default state of being, and the fluidity and constancy of the stream of profanity was rather awe inspiring. 
Mirenithil	I salute you for being able to admit this, it takes genuine guts. You're already way ahead. You may find something useful in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6he015/serious_folks_who_used_to_be_incels_neckbeards_or/).
Mirenithil	My Hispanic boyfriend would be routinely followed by store security in many stores we went to. It was a massive eye-opener for me, because they'd never followed me like that when white-girl me was alone. It was constant, just a normal Tuesday for him, and it never stopped in the three years we were together. I couldn't believe it because he would no more shoplift than he would run naked through Times Square at noon, but he was consistently treated like he was on the verge of grabbing something and running obviously just because he wasn't white. 
Mirenithil	I've handled it before by being very upfront about reminding people often that the nature of a contest is that only however many people will win out of a lot of entrants. I don't know how well that approach will work for your situation, though, because since you are trying to build your visibility you want to keep things as positive as possible.
Mirenithil	41 here. I think back to when I was very judgmental of old folks for being stuck in the music of the past. It's time for me to eat crow, because it's my turn to be one of those old folks. I seem to be pretty much stuck in the 70s - mid 90s. I find I don't really pay much of any attention at all to the stuff that's current now. And I'm sure there are youngins judging me for it in the same way I judged all those old farts back in the day. Serves me right.
Mirenithil	Yikes. That is grade-A deluxe crappy treatment. And only *one* of them stayed with you after something as appalling as that? I don't have words for this. I'm sorry you ever had to endure it. 
Mirenithil	Why do you keep asking this every night?
Mirenithil	Because you have to be an asshole of the highest tier to be someone who genuinely thinks "this problem doesn't affect me personally. Therefore, it isn't a problem and it doesn't even matter."

Mirenithil	IMO the #1 issue is the fact that that media is for-profit and money is the real bottom line. If you are a media outlet, you want your viewers to come back as frequently as possible for maximum clicks and page views (to maximize ad revenue,) and in order to keep them coming back, it is very effective to keep them as angry/outraged about the other side as possible. Being divisive is unfortunately therefore a very profitable thing, and as we're seeing now, it has unbelievably poisonous side-effects for the well-being of the country.

Mirenithil	The #1 thing to be on the lookout for right now and for some time for the future will unfortunately be flood cars that people are trying to pass off as not-flood-cars. It's always an excellent idea to take any used car you are considering to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection in any case, but after the hurricane floods, that's something else that has to be looked for. Make sure to ask the techs to specifically look for signs the car was involved in a flood while they are doing the usual pre-purchase inspection. (And please do have the pre-purchase inspection done by a professional. They can do things like a compression test and check codes etc. that can save you heartache and $ down the road.)

Mirenithil	I recieved a piece of snail mail once where they got the address and my first name right, but somehow, I have no idea how, turned my last name into a full on legit Japanese last name somewhat similar in pronunciation. I have to guess it was speech recognition software that did it or something, but yeah, I was pretty impressed.
Mirenithil	The news of 9-11. I was walking around in a sort of zombielike dream state for a while afterwards; it didn't seem real, and it seemed weird that the processes of ordinary life still had to go on. We were all glued to the news at that time, and I really don't remember what I did afterwards thanks to the surreality of it all.

Mirenithil	So get this. There are all these hamsters, right. They escape into one of those plastic lawn flamingo factories. The thing about these hamsters is that they are half-brilliant, half-not. The engineer hamsters turn the lawn flamingos into Gundam style hamster suits, with the hamster logic that since humans are used to seeing plastic lawn flamingos, it's the perfect camoflage to move around secretly in public in. The hamsters in their lawn flamingo gundam suits save the world from ninja pirate viking warriors from space.  I plan to buy my own private island with a fifty million dollar mansion with my share of the proceeds from the inevitable blockbuster movie made with this idea.

Mirenithil	Be careful how you clean them. There is no such thing as a scratch proof lens, no matter what they say, just different levels of scratch resistance. This is how I clean my glasses, and it's a system I've settled on after years of cleaning them a few different ways:   - Never clean your lenses with dirty fabric. This goes double for anything that has been exposed to sand and may possibly have fine grains of sand trapped in its fibers, like a towel. You will be a sad panda.  - Instead, first rinse your glasses with running water. This will rinse most of the things that can cause scratching off without causing scratching.  - I wash my lenses with bar soap, using only light pressure with my fingers to work the soap all over the lenses and frame.  - Then, water pressure to wash the soap off. Pay especial attention to the crevices, like around the outside of the lenses.  - I then dry the glasses on a towel I never use for any other purpose.  - I don't like using lens wipes because you don't have the chance to rinse dirt that might scratch off first, but I'll use them in a pinch.

I turned it in at customer services because I realized that that might be all the money someone had for important christmas presents. Do I think the money really had a chance to be returned to the person who lost it? not really, no, but if it was at all possible I had to try.
Mirenithil	This exactly. To add to that, I don't understand the market for tabloids about them. That isn't to put them down or anything - it's just an interest I don't share and don't understand at all. I guess I'm in something of a minority in my opinion that their private lives should be allowed to remain private.
Mirenithil	Professor Layton Does Minecraft. That actually could be a really good custom Minecraft map if made by the right person.
MrCruesliPants	Is 4.1 is accessible to non-press?
MrCruesliPants	Thanks for the feedback! It might really be the stick then, as I do have a PAL version of Giga Wing (running on my PAL Dreamcast). Hm, I'll try some more and also hope to get a newer stick some time soon!
MrCruesliPants	It's the Dreamcast Arcade Stick from SEGA. I'm playing on a projector connected via VGA. Giga Wing controls fine with normal controller and the arcade stick seems to work normally with Soulcalibur. 
MrCruesliPants	Is anyone playing Giga Wing with the arcade stick? It feels slow and unresponsive. | Does anyone have experience playing Giga Wing with the official Dreamcast arcade stick? I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if there are additional settings or modes to be considered, but controlling the movement of the ship with stick feels very slow and unresponsive - making the game much, much harder.   Any advice? Thanks!
MrCruesliPants	Yes, you're right, it's the Agetec stick I have. I wasn't aware that the stick wasn't produced by SEGA. Thanks for pointing that out.  It's an official disk. I'm really wondering if it's supposed to control this way. The stick *is* modded to give an USB output as well, which could be the reason for the unresponsive controls. However, in Soulcalibur everything seems to work fine.

MrCruesliPants	What method do you use the export the save in the first place?
MrCruesliPants	That's an awesome present! What are the games on picture 11 and 13? Which game did you end up enjoy playing the most?
MrCruesliPants	Enjoy it! What games will you be getting for your shiny new console?
MrCruesliPants	I found the first Sonic Adventure to feel clunky as well. For such a fast paced game, I think it's detrimental that it runs at 30fps. Sonic Adventure 2 runs at 60fps, however, so this might be an important factor in it holding up better. SA2 is on the top of my list of games I still want to get for my PAL system!
MrCruesliPants	There is a boss about half-way through that is difficult to beat if you've been sticking with the initial characters and haven't leveled up someone else whose abilities are very favorable for this fight. This is the only time other than the final boss battle that I had to grind and in general skipped a lot of the battles.   If you have more questions, I played through the game only last year, so I hope I should be able to answer.
MrCruesliPants	Thank you very sharing, that was very interesting to read. What guide would you send to your established writers, including yourself? I'm curious to know if there are things you have to still remind yourself of when writing and editing reviews.
MrCruesliPants	Fantastic update. The newly added features seem to make Galaxy a true alternative to other clients. I appreciate how the new features have all been asked for by the community. However, at least one [highly requested feature](https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy/release_the_gog_galaxy_client_for_linux) is still missing - no word on a Linux version of the client in this update. I'm hoping that after this release development of the Linux client will take priority.
MrCruesliPants	There's a Japanese TV series called "1 Litre of Tears". I think that should fit the bill! 
MrCruesliPants	Thanks for sharing. I think the lighting really makes this a nice display. Does it look as nice as it does on the photo?
MrCruesliPants	Maybe, you'd like [Edward Carnby (Tiësto Vocal Mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThL5yi0qmA)?
MrCruesliPants	PowerManga - One Piece 851 (English) | 
MrCruesliPants	Really nice write-up, thanks for sharing. The audio issue you had and your solution is something I'll keep in mind for sure.   I have the same mouse as you do and wanted to ask about ckb. Do you also have to reactivate your profile after waking up the system from suspend? Also, I don't quite understand how hardware profiles should work. Does ckb otherwise work flawlessly for you? 
MrCruesliPants	I have been thinking about this as well. For myself, I decided it's not worth it. Here's a list of games of PS3 that I am interested in playing:  * Okami HD * Shadow of the Colossus/ICO HD * Uncharted 2 [*] * Heavy Rain * Flower [*] * Journey [*] * The Last of Us [*] * Catherine * Ni No Kuni * Red Dead Redemption * Heavenly Sword * Persona 4 Arena  Quiet a few of these games are available on the PS4 now (marked with [*]). In Europe, even a used PS3 buys you half of a new PS4. It just doesn't look worth it to me.   Would love to hear some other opinions, but I believe I'll skip the PS3 and will get a PS4 probably this year still.
MrCruesliPants	Right, thanks! Got an M65 mouse myself and I'm very happy that the open source drivers exist. There has been a lack of updates for quite some time now though, I really hope the keyboards and mice can be supported in the future too.
MrCruesliPants	I see you're using ckb as well. Can I ask, do you have the same issue of having to reset your configuration after suspending and resuming the system?
MrCruesliPants	> There's absolutely no reason for them to hold off on expanding their most successful franchise.  Except, of course, an ambition to have anything they release feel fresh and unique. I'm very much thinking that we'll see a next Persona game only years after this new fantasy rpg releases. And I'm really ok with that if their Persona games keep being this good. I do think we'll see some spin-offs to P5 soon though! 
MrCruesliPants	Awesome! Didn't know new announcements for Persona games were already confirmed for next year. I'm excited! What kind of spin-off would you like to see? 
MrCruesliPants	Oh, I had no idea about this. I heard a lot of positive talk about this game, I really wish that people would get more sensitive to issues like that and point them out when reviewing the game. So, hey, thanks for doing that.   I was ready to buy this game, I'll hold off to see whether this partial always online requirement will be dropped.
MrCruesliPants	This is a stupid question, but I can't figure out whether this a rendered digital model or if it was actually built? In any case, the use of transparent cheese slopes for the rough seas is brilliant!
MrCruesliPants	Hey, I wanted to post a reply before this thread is archived. I got Takenoko after your suggestion - I really like the theme and length - and had the chance to play for the first time on Saturday. It was perfect, really. None of us (three) had played the game before, but it was really fun and light-hearted. At the same time, all of us started to develop just a little bit of a strategy. Oh, I'm really happy that now King of Tokyo is not the *only* choice of game we have for such gaming evenings.  Thanks again for your suggestion!

MrCruesliPants	Tiesto pres. Alone In The Dark: inferno - Edward Carnby (Tiesto Vocal Mix) | 
MrCruesliPants	Thanks for this. What's happening to gametech?
MrCruesliPants	I want to know too! I know nothing quite like it. Excited to see some suggestions here.
MrCruesliPants	Interesting view. But I'm not quite sure I understand what you are saying. Why would I need to spend (a lot) of money to support my mental health with gaming? I could play cheaper games, free games, old games... 
MrCruesliPants	[WSIG] Games that are fun even when you play it for the first time - but still offer a more in depth and immersive experience? | I'm still looking for *the one* game that we could play when we're having guests over and that goes into a little more depth.   Ideally, I would like to be able to set up, explain the game and finish the game within 2.5 hours. I'm looking for games that work best with 4 and 5 players. We don't have a regular friend group that we're playing with so it's important that this game is fun the first time you play it!  I'm specifically looking for a more thematic game, that allows the players to possibly play a little bit into the narrative of the game. We have King of Tokyo which I think is working well for the short and light experience, but I'm looking for something meatier here. I'd love for the players to get caught up in the game somewhat, either because of the theme or because of the mechanics, working out their own strategy and competing to win. I don't think I would like a game where one of the players takes special role but rather would like for everyone to be equal players.   I've been considering Suburbia and Lords of Waterdeep. But I'm sure there's a lot of other options out there that I haven't considered and that might possibly fit better. I would love to get suggestions. Thanks a lot!  EDIT: Thank you for all the great suggestions, I'll have a look at all of the games and get one or even two of them!

MrCruesliPants	In past years, there has been a neogaf thread exactly for this purpose. It has worked really nicely for me. 
MrCruesliPants	There's a weekly board game meetup in Berlin. It's really nice and many people there talk English. You should check it out! 
MrCruesliPants	Incredible! Had a smile on my face watching the video the entire time.  Can you please tell me how you made the automated sliding doors?
MrCruesliPants	Great list, thanks for writing it up. I think Zanzarah also fits the "Monster Capture" description. 
MrCruesliPants	Little brother by Cory Doctorow fits well I think. It's closest to Ready Player One out of the books you listed.
MrCruesliPants	>  I find most games to have fairly shallow endings  I completely agree. Personally though, I'm still very interested in seeing a game to *an* end. Sometimes that means actually finishing it, other times it means deciding for myself that I'm done with the game.    I do feel strongly about being able to finish something and I tried to share some ways I fund being able to "finish" a game on my terms without feeling uncomfortable or dissatisfied and not feeling pressured by my backlog. 
MrCruesliPants	I think this thread so far offers very little advice on how to deal with an overwhelming backlog. Sunk costs might be a contribution, but video games have also strongly trained us as completionists. There definitely is something satisfying about being to beat a game. The feeling of "I finished this game, let's move on" is rewarding and might in some cases even be worth playing the game if you're not 100% enjoying it.   For myself I've found two ways two practical ways of dealing with the uneasiness that comes with uncompleted games. Steam has been offering different lists in your library for a long time and games that I don't enjoy, that I don't plan to finish, just get kicked off the main list that I'm using. Not too long ago, Steam even allows you the more radical step of completely removing the game from your library.   The other thing that helped me achieving a positive feeling about my library is using a separate list of completed games. By having an external list somewhere of the completed games (I use howlongtobeat), it's not about the overwhelming majority of uncompleted games, the failures, but a list of the awesome games you beat. Here it's about the achievements.
MrCruesliPants	I've been thinking about getting into these books for a while now. Is there anyone who's read a few of them and can comment on the series as a whole?
MrCruesliPants	Starbound & Torchlight II.
MrCruesliPants	Portal has the perfect length. It never overstays its welcome, everything you do in the game is relevant and feels fresh.   After playing and completing it, I didn't feel like I was missing anything. Sure I wanted to play more, but that's just because it was so fun and not because I was feeling unfulfilled with the story and game. 
MrCruesliPants	I enjoyed reading this more than any text I remember reading in the last few months. Are you considering writing a book on your journey collecting video games? If not, I think you should!
MrCruesliPants	Will be released as an eShop title only. I was really hoping for a physical release. It's sad to me that I can't have a physical representation of my collection of Ace Attorney games. It seems like such a big and popular title, is producing physical copies, even if it's just direct to order or with selected retailers, so expensive and unimaginable? 
MrCruesliPants	http://www.holywowstudios.com/worldoftyping/  You can thank me later.
MrCruesliPants	Terraria and Starbound should fit the bill. For something faster paced, you could try Torchlight 2.
MrCruesliPants	I feel your pain.

MrCruesliPants	[Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRLdhFVzqt4)? 
MrCruesliPants	The title seems a bit misleading, for now they are only testing the system and haven't decided on the capture tech they will eventually use for the game. Or am I missing something?   In any case, exciting news, and it's great to hear an update on the development of Shenmue III!
MrCruesliPants	> ie: a secondary screen on the monitor that doesn't allow fullscreen like DS emulators  Sorry, what do you mean by that?
MrCruesliPants	Awesome! So, both Firewatch and Gone Home often get termed "Walking Simulators". You could try looking around for more in that genre, although I think you might have played the two most outstanding games here already. 
MrCruesliPants	If you want a direct sequel to Ender's Game, the next book to read would be [Ender in Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile). I believe continuing the series, both the Ender (more space) and Shadow (more Earth), is worth it.
MrCruesliPants	You're probably aware of /r/chiptunes? Next to Slime Girls, another favorite there is [Shirobon](http://shirobon.bandcamp.com/). Personally, I like [Graviton Flux](https://soundcloud.com/graviton-flux/continuum) a lot. 
MrCruesliPants	You could try Gone Home. It's darker and and not as open as Firewatch, but you are exploring the environment without pressure.
MrCruesliPants	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKjEtnnXEHsXE9IvCb92V7g/videos
MrCruesliPants	"Bei Mir Bist Du Scheen" reminds me very much of [Caravan Palace - Clash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBZdSHAIZI). 
MrCruesliPants	You know what was my favourite part when watching the series about a year ago? Watching the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJIeJIqw-J0).   It's weird, usually if an opening is rather long (more than 10 seconds) I tend to skip them, but with this one, I watched it all the way through for every single episode. I can't very well explain why I liked it so much, but the opening gave a sense of peace and calmness that haven't very much experienced in other shows yet.
MrCruesliPants	No, GDC is still happening. I think it's an unfortunate formulation. With *conference* they mean the Pokémon GO session.  > Previously, it was announced that on March 14th, John Hanke from Niantic was to host a presentation on Pokémon GO at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Unfortunately, it has just been announced that this conference has been cancelled.  (from serebii.net) 
MrCruesliPants	Super impressive. The proportions look absolutely perfect to me, getting the shape right must have been a challenge! I also really like the attention to detail. A few questions!    - How long did it take you to build?   - Did you print the stickers yourself and did you order them somewhere?   - Would you consider creating instructions for the build?
MrCruesliPants	Any specific ones you remember? I listened to it randomly and so far nothing stood out to me.
MrCruesliPants	[IIL] Ambient music that could be theme songs of a mega corporation in a Cyberpunk future (Sarif Industries theme) [WEWIL?] | Here are two examples:  Sarif Industries theme (DXHR): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy92E2nCUlI  Endure (Z-Type): http://nofatenetmusic.bandcamp.com/track/endure-z-type  Any kind of songs that you can think of that would fit this theme? 
MrCruesliPants	Oh, yeah, I never actually saw their video format! I don't feel like I'm missing much either, and for me, that's a good thing as I prefer pure audio version to be able to go about and do stuff. It's also definitely the most balanced podcast gaming podcast I'm listening to, in terms of discussing games on Nintendo, Playstation and Xbox platforms as well as PC gaming!
MrCruesliPants	Long time fan of GWJ as well. I think you might also enjoy  *The Game Informer Show* from the magazine with the same name. They have really nice discussions about recent games with the people that reviewed them for the site and email sections. They also recently started a book-club kind of format where they are playing through Final Fantasy VII and discussing it, so that aspect is particularly patientgamer friendly. It's quickly becoming my favourite podcast!
MrCruesliPants	The Youtube comments now produced "Letting Go - Andrew Britton & Matthew Robertson". I'm not familiar with the artists and other than finding another matching Youtube video couldn't confirm the correct title yet.
MrCruesliPants	Although I'm going to say that () deserves your full attention instead of just listening to it while studying. It's that good.

TrinixDMorrison	What was your biggest unintentionally douchebag moment? | 
TrinixDMorrison	> No, you just didn't read the signs, dipshit.  It is downright infuriating how common that is in so many situations, especially since most problems can be avoided by doing precisely that. 
TrinixDMorrison	In my dad's case it was absolutely a power game. Every time we'd make it to our destination and I complained about it he'd just call me a wuss and laugh :/ 
TrinixDMorrison	In my case, I was in a group chat with my friends. We've all known each other since middle school so we fuck with each other all the time and generally don't hold back, but even then we have moments of seriousness because we are grown-ass men after all. So one of the guys asks the group if anyone has any experience dealing with debt collectors. Without skipping a beat my immediate response was;   "Sorry man, can't help you there. I've never been in debt before :P"   The following few messages were a mix of "lol dick" and "wow, really?". Kinda felt bad about that one, even though we were all able to play it off like we're just messing with each other as usual. 
TrinixDMorrison	I hated it when my dad would tell me to "just follow him" because he'd always blast through traffic lights. Every time he sped through a yellow that was just about to turn red (hell, sometimes he even ran the reds), I'd be stuck there watching my dad's car getting smaller and smaller in the distance.  It's why nowadays I refuse to follow him and instead demand he give me the address to where we're going. 
TrinixDMorrison	Man I know exactly what you mean. I used to work for a Japanese airline company back at San Francisco, and people would always ask me really stupid questions. "Do you work here?" is definitely one of the most annoying ones. It's like, "Me? Oh no, I don't work here. This uniform I'm wearing, as well as the security clearance badge? I just killed someone who does and just took his clothes."
TrinixDMorrison	"I don't know why, I just don't want to work. I do want to make money though."
TrinixDMorrison	It's a shame cuz they did mention at one live show that Danny would be in an episode of Doodle Doods if that's what the fans wanted...to which the crowd just exploded in agreement :/ 
TrinixDMorrison	I can't pinpoint which video it was exactly but Julian says in an episode of Oney Plays that they're no longer recording at the Game Grump's office and that they're recording at Chris' apartment. 
TrinixDMorrison	I'm always amazed at how long people are willing to wait on food delivery. I'm sure a lot of them are exaggerating but there's still a good chunk of the population that will just wait.  I used to work at a Little Caesars in high school, and as some of you may know, Little Caesars doesn't deliver. Well some people wouldn't know that and so will order a pizza by phone and then call back like 3 hours later, all pissed off and demanding to know where their pizza is. You'd think the fact that we didn't ask them for their address or anything would tip them off, but nah.
TrinixDMorrison	This feels more like incompetence on the consumer's side. I'm sure if you were to cluster them together like in the picture it would look decent and cool. Scatter them apart and it looks like you have an infestation. 
TrinixDMorrison	Hand down, fucking [Boobah](https://youtu.be/v7kkDOQPqps)  The show is such a mystery. It's literally nonstop random colors and sounds, and the kids in the show are much older than the intended audience. And then there's the narrator...you'd think because this is a kid's show they'd have a chipper upbeat voice like "HEEEEY KIDS!!!! ARE YOU READY FOR BOOBAAAAH?!?!?!", but no. It's a very calm and monotone old man, like a bored Patrick Stewart reading off the instruction off the back of a box of Poptarts. 
TrinixDMorrison	I feel like the "expectation" pic is the "reality" pic from a different comparison pic, and the porcupine is just getting progressively worse in each iteration XD 
TrinixDMorrison	Oh shit, what are the odds XD 
TrinixDMorrison	Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation  Near the end of the movie there's literally a giant and physical plot-hole where Buster and Babs ride a mine cart through. It's like the writers kept adding more and more scenes and jokes and setups into the movie that they weren't sure how to resolve it all, so they just decided "fuck it".

You come into our beautiful country, steal all the industrial secrets that made us a super power, and you're going to take it back to your pinchy eyed friends back in China or Japan or whatever ching-chong country you came from, you DISEASE RIDDLED SEWER RAT!"  "I was born and raised in San Francisco!"  "......Hm, I appear to have made a mistake."
TrinixDMorrison	When I was like 8 years old, my friends and I all got super soakers and had a hell of a summer. Whenever we had to refill it we'd go to this one house near the park we played at and use their garden hose, and sometimes the woman who lived there would scream at us from her windows and chase us away. This didn't stop us though, and it kind of became a game for us where we'd try to get the water without getting her attention. Sometimes we'd just turn on the water and run away because "hahaha she's gonna be so mad lol".  As a kid I thought she was just some grumpy mean old lady, but now that I'm an adult and know that "water bills" and "trespassing" is a thing....yea, I would've been pretty pissed too if I were in her position. 
TrinixDMorrison	> "WILL IT WORK? HOW CAN YOU KNOW? HOW CAN ANYONE KNOW? You will know after you try."  We need to see this more in advertising.   ***Will this bulletproof baseball cap really work?! You'll know after you try it!"***
TrinixDMorrison	> There were problems with audio syncing so often  We still had that quite frequently with Super Mega, but people tend to let that go because they do "funny edits". 
TrinixDMorrison	 I'd love to see Arin take pics with fans by bending his knees a bit to make himself look shorter, just to play on the whole "Arin's portrayed as being shorter than Danny" thing that seemed to bother him so much a while ago and to constantly confuse fans.   "Arin is just as tall as Danny!"  "No but look at this pic. I'm 5'5" and he's clearly only up to my shoulders."  "Dude I'm like 6ft even and he's pretty much the same height as I am."  "Guys guys, I've actually met Arin. I'm 4'10" and he's only a little taller than I am."
TrinixDMorrison	That being said, it really didn't help when Suzy and Brian tweeted about the whole "controversy". 
TrinixDMorrison	"No but that's different"
TrinixDMorrison	Went to a party a few years ago and started talking to a few girls about anime and video games, when this one girl approaches the group and claims she likes anime too. I felt like she was pretending to like anime so she can put the focus back on her, so I asked her who her favorite character was in Dragon Ball. No joke, she replied "The dragon, of course!"  We all got a good laugh out of that one. 
TrinixDMorrison	Man, Arin had such a genuine laugh back then. Now all his "laughs" sound really sarcastic and fake. 
TrinixDMorrison	Probably didn't help that episode 2 had more setting up (and failing) than the actual challenge itself. I guess this goes hand in hand with their decline in quality and effort. Why research the stage before hand and jump right into challenges when you can instead milk 7 minutes of a 10 minute video looking for 8 red coins and failing? Less work, same amount of money. 
TrinixDMorrison	I remember seeing a gif once that compared men's soccer and women's soccer.   It starts with the men's, and one guy gets a casual pat on the back from the player from the opposing team and the dude screams and falls over like he was just shot or something.   Then it cuts to the women's where this one girl takes a soccer ball to the face. Her nose is bleeding like crazy, and what does she do? She wipes off the blood with one wrist, spits out whatever blood made it to her mouth, and cracks her knuckles as if to say "Okay let's do this."  I fell in love that day. 
TrinixDMorrison	It was during one of his twitch streams. He was playing Shadow Tactics, I think. 
TrinixDMorrison	Ah, my bad. I've gotten so used to talking about Super that I didn't notice "Kai" in the title. 
TrinixDMorrison	Isn't Supreme Kai looking at Future Trunks in this scene though? 
TrinixDMorrison	Jesus fuck, the comments on that video. It's sad that a few years ago I would've assumed it's just a bunch of dumbass teenagers trolling, but now I legit can't tell. 
TrinixDMorrison	> “You don’t expect your kids going to school and having to deal with racism and discrimination in 2017,” said Lamont Webb, the girl’s father. “It’s kind of appalling.”  The fuck kind of sheltered, utopian loopy land is this guy living in?
TrinixDMorrison	They did enjoy it....the first time it was posted. And the second time...a little less by the third time. After seeing it a hundred times the magic is gone. 
TrinixDMorrison	As a Japanese guy who constantly sees Japanese things taken out of context and people with no frame of reference just accept it as something that commonly happens in Japan...yea, a lot of the "weird Japan stuff" that gets posted here are just as weird in Japan.
TrinixDMorrison	I'm still loving how Womble's mom got him a "last will and testament kit" last Christmas. 
TrinixDMorrison	> Today i sit and write this while at Dennys  As if you haven't suffered enough :(   Seriously though, sorry to hear about your place. 
TrinixDMorrison	I remember playing Shenmue and thinking "this is as realistic as video games will ever be!" when it let me open drawers and look at folded clothes. 
TrinixDMorrison	Ooooooh so this is what Oney's been playing with in some of the recent OneyPlays.
TrinixDMorrison	I've seen this reposted with the plane facing upwards, left, and right.   Maybe on the next repost we'll see it rotated so the plane is facing down, or get really creative and have it flying diagonally. The possibilities are endless! 
TrinixDMorrison	It's seriously not that big of a deal. It's basically a small lens-like ore that can capture a dragon's life essence. Jon Snow needs a charged dragon glass to bring Sansa back to life. 
TrinixDMorrison	It kind of felt like one of those live action Nickelodeon movies that doesn't make it into theaters and instead airs on the channel, like that Fairly Odd Parents movie. 
TrinixDMorrison	It's a shame that in part 2 Arin is back to singing "suck my dick, suck my dick" along with the soundtrack :/ 
TrinixDMorrison	"OMG I literally just woke up and got out of bed. No make up or shower or nothing! I'm so embarrassed!"
TrinixDMorrison	Eminem Had Some Strong Words for Donald Trump at His Scotland Concert| "MOTHERFUCK DONALD TRUMP" (article in comments) | 
TrinixDMorrison	I thought nothing of it when I was a kid but after being a teacher, I always felt bad for the kids who had parents that were either too busy or too broke to go on vacations during summer :/  Suzy : I visited my grandma in Florida and went to Disney World!  Brian : I went camping with my dad!  Jessica : I went to a water park!  Tony : ......I stayed at home, watching YouTube and playing video games.  
TrinixDMorrison	Sorry to see you go, but I do understand. If it's any consolation, I don't think you acted out of line; the people who were offended by your art could've voiced their displeasure in a more mature manner instead of calling you crazy or whatever. 
TrinixDMorrison	Had a Japanese guy in my class named Kosuke and one teacher genuinely and confusedly pronounced it "Cocksucky".  You better believe that was his nickname for the rest of high school and onwards. 
TrinixDMorrison	That's gotta hurt. Basically saying, "the best Game Grumps series in recent memory is the one without Arin or Danny, aka the Game Grumps". 
TrinixDMorrison	Nah she was straight up lying. Her ex-boyfriend had custody of her daughter, and there was no proof that she had a second job or that she was going to school. She'd constantly call out from work at the last minute saying her anxiety's acting up or that she's too depressed to come in. This was at a daycare too, so to have someone call out at the last minute was just inconvenient as all hell. I genuinely have no idea how she still has a job. I quit mainly cuz I couldn't stand her, and also found a better job that pays almost triple what I was making there. 
TrinixDMorrison	Maybe he's a fan of Danny Sexbang.
TrinixDMorrison	[Very original there, Eminem...](http://archive.is/R2LKY)
TrinixDMorrison	He'll be just like those random redditors and gamers that get quoted in video game launch trailers.   "Amazing." - Destructoid  "Definitely worth it!" - Game Informer  "its like dark souls but not as hard" - w33dking420
TrinixDMorrison	You sound like you've got some shit to work out. 
TrinixDMorrison	There would be no sadness if we were super gay. 
TrinixDMorrison	> One month an employee kept refusing to buy candy  There's always that one asshole who has no sense of fun and has to ruin it for everyone else. I remember at my previous job we'd have a potluck at the end of every month. Some people would make something, others would buy something. It was a fun little event where some people can show off their culinary skills and get to know some of the coworkers you have little to no interaction with on a normal day......but then there was this one bitch who would never bring anything because she's a "struggling single mom who has to balance 2 jobs, raising her daughter, and going to school" (she was like late 30s). Now guess who would always eat the most at the potluck and even bring fucking tupperware so she can take home the left overs? 
TrinixDMorrison	Bruh, when Roshi recited those principles of the KameSen-Ryu...nostalgia tingles, man :O 
TrinixDMorrison	It's a shame because his first two videos on Doug and Noah were actually pretty good.   Then he made a video about Linkara and that was just an unnecessary and lazy attack on Lewis; Metokur mostly shits on him for the shitty webcomic he made when he was like 16, and his porn searches. Seriously, the majority of the video was "haha this guy made a shitty webcomic" and "haha this guy likes weird porn". There's plenty of things you can make fun of Linkara for, like the apparent unprofessional disaster that was the filming of his movie. Digging up a poorly drawn webcomic from his teenage years that even Linkara himself has admitted as being terrible and then making fun of him for it...it was just lazy if anything. 
TrinixDMorrison	I've had that happen to me...usually on days when a group presentation was due. 
TrinixDMorrison	That was amusing simply because he acted like Fallout 3 and onwards aren't "true" Fallouts, saying 1 and 2 are absolute classics, and then years later absolutely sucking at Fallout 2 and saying what a terrible and broken game it was. 
TrinixDMorrison	Why would teachers even care if you and your friends were roasting each other? Or did they overreact and think "The Tea Party" was a code word for "shooting up the cafeteria"? 
TrinixDMorrison	"Shopping" is technically incorrect, since most of those stores are restaurants. 
TrinixDMorrison	I'll be visiting SF next weekend for my friend's birtheday...I have a feeling I'm gonna come back to Reno 30lbs heavier lol
TrinixDMorrison	I'm so glad you're one of the players who knows the difference :D   Too many people are all "Pfft, Fallout New Vegas on no kill is totally easy. Just let Boone and Rex do all the killing while you sit back."
TrinixDMorrison	"And then Kaiba fucking summons a Blue Eyes White Dragon"  "Oooooh shit, Pegasus is fucked now!"  "No but that's the thing! Pegasus takes control of the Blue Eyes and turns it into this, Blue Eyes Toon Dragon"  "WHAAAAAAAAAT"
TrinixDMorrison	>So Spoony, what did you think of the new X-Com?  >***BETRAAAAAAAAAAYAL!!!!!! THIS GAME SUUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!***  >(jumps up and down like an angry gorilla)  Even Angry Joe was surprised and looking around nervously, and then walking away saying "I'm not with him."
TrinixDMorrison	You're right. Last thing we need is for the toxic fanbase to flood this thread and then take a screencap and post it onto the Game Grumps subreddit with the title "We're leaking into /r/funny". My apologies. 
TrinixDMorrison	"This story was originally shared to Imgur."  Wow, so they're not even trying to hide the fact that they're just stealing random shit from Imgur/Reddit anymore.  
TrinixDMorrison	I remember one year I had to buy a $300 textbook because a new edition came out and the one my friend had from taking the exact same class the previous year would not be accepted.  Literally the only thing they changed was the stock photo in one of the pages. That's when I knew American college is fucking robbery. In comparison most commonly used Japanese text books go anywhere from $30~$50. ***Maybe*** over $100 if it's a masters course, but never fucking $300. 
TrinixDMorrison	Knowing Spoony, he couldn't be assed to take it down so it's still there, albeit with a table in front of it with a pile of random board games and gaming paraphernalia. 
TrinixDMorrison	Pretty sure deaths in cutscenes and scripted events aren't counted in your stats. It's why your kill count doesn't increase even if you detonate the bomb in Megaton in Fallout 3. 
TrinixDMorrison	"You want some corn? I'm not crazy by the way."
TrinixDMorrison	Right : when you see a real vagina for the first time after years of seeing pixelated hentai vagina.
TrinixDMorrison	"Alright, time for bed.......WAIT WAS THAT REPORT DUE TOMORROW OR NEXT MONDAY?!"
TrinixDMorrison	I remember I had a similar mod installed in Skyrim for those damn frostbite spiders. 
TrinixDMorrison	Seriously, what does Barry do anymore? When he was replaced by Kevin and Super Mega he still had the middle slot with Ross, as well as working on some side projects like "How About This Game", but now that the middle slot is gone I genuinely have no idea what it is that he does. I think he was on one episode of Dan learns Overwatch, but that's pretty much it. 
TrinixDMorrison	Wake Me Up When September Ends - Greenday  As a kid I hated it because literally every radio station would play it at the end of summer and it was a somber reminder that yes, summer vacation has indeed ended and school is starting again.
TrinixDMorrison	Maybe he likes being wrapped up in a burrito because it reminds him of how he'd snuggle up with his four other brothers and sisters for warmth?   Aaaaaand now I've made myself sad. 
TrinixDMorrison	You have no idea how well you have it. I didn't until I left. It's one of those "I didn't realize how much I truly loved you until you were gone" situations.   Did you know there's no bubble tea in Reno?! CUZ I DIDN'T! 
TrinixDMorrison	Why do people still talk about Jon Tron here? Sure he was a former GG member, but that was a long time ago. Hell, he'd only been on the show for like a year before he left. I get that people liked him, but talking about him in a place for ranting about Game Grumps just sounds silly. I'm sure he has his own subreddit where shit like this would be more relevant.   This is like talking about what Kevin's been doing since he left GG, or complaining about an episode of OneyPlays because he'd been on GG several times. 
TrinixDMorrison	Anata Dake Mitsumeteru - Oguro Maki  Not really sad, but depressing. You wouldn't guess it from the [video](https://youtu.be/Q_rbZeIIpVA) but if you look at the lyrics it's about a girl who's willing to change everything about herself just for this one guy. Like, EVERYTHING.   You don't like girls wearing makeup? I'LL NEVER WEAR MAKEUP AGAIN.  You prefer girls with shorter hair? I'LL CUT MY HAIR AND WILL KEEP IT THE EXACT LENGTH YOU PREFER.  You like cars? I'LL LEARN EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT CARS.  You don't want me talking to my friends who just happen to be guys because you get jealous? OKAY I'LL NEVER TALK TO THEM AGAIN.  I guess it's supposed to be a cute and romantic "love changes people" sort of song, but it really sounds like a mentally unstable girl with low self-esteem who was hurt in the past is now desperately doing everything she can so the one guy to show her any positive affection won't leave her. 
TrinixDMorrison	You know, I've genuinely wondered why some people reply to a comment that's 20 hours old and has 1000+ upvotes. 
TrinixDMorrison	I've lived in Japan and San Francisco all my life, so I was really surprised when I moved to Reno and didn't see "green tea" when I went to an ice-cream/soft serve place. 
TrinixDMorrison	Barry : Hey Arin, I have a funny idea for a silly video!  Arin : AHahAhahaHAHa!!! ThaT's gREat BArrry!!! Nah but seriously, just make it 10 minutes and put it up on the middle slot.   Barry : Wait 10 minutes? I was thinking of a quick 15 second silly clip for twitter or something.   Arin : No no, that's exactly why it's going to be 10 minutes. We're being ironic!  Barry : I'm...I'm starting to think you don't really know what that word means.
TrinixDMorrison	I am loving the denial that's fueling the whole "look on the bright side" mentality of these fans. One guy on my facebook feed shared an article that pointed out how McGregor is an amazing boxer because he landed more hits than Pacquiao did against Floyd. So that one random statistic makes him an amazing athlete, I guess? 
TrinixDMorrison	"Instead of killing me *before* I went to work and saving me all that headache and bullshit from stupid people you waited til *after* work? Shit man, you really are an unholy piece of shit." 
TrinixDMorrison	"I don't need or even want this, but I need something to bump up my total to $50 so I can get that free shipping."
TrinixDMorrison	Half Life 3  No matter how good the final product is (if it's ever released), it will never live up to the insane amount of hype. Just look at Duke Nukem Forever.
TrinixDMorrison	>  they are playing it on the wii with a wiimote and nunchuck  Of course he's playing the wii version; it's got worse controls so he can bitch and rage about it. Dumbass 10 year olds eat that shit up. 
TrinixDMorrison	Japanese Kit-Kats are fucking amazing compared to American ones. There's just so many different varieties of flavors, from matcha green tea to strawberries cream to even apples. 
TrinixDMorrison	"That happened."  It's such a low effort way of trying to sound like a snide asshole, but it just show how little originality you have that the only way you can react to something happening is to literally announce that something happened. 
TrinixDMorrison	> six months later the farmers invited them back six months later for sausages out of gratitude.  I like the way this is phrased. So 6 months after the fire, the farmers invited them for sausages 6 months later? So a year then? 
TrinixDMorrison	I forgot the name, it's that old fashioned American diner looking place with the red booth chairs and stuff. Near the Whole Foods and Buca di Beppo. 
TrinixDMorrison	There's a place in Palo Alto, CA that serves this thing called a "Bubbly Burger" and it's $150.   It's literally just a regular burger that comes with the other dishes, but is accompanied by a glass of dom perignon. So yea, you're pretty much just paying for the fucking campaign. 
TrinixDMorrison	This. People need to know the difference between being selfless and being self-destructive. Sure you'd be a really helpful person if you let your friend borrow $300 because he can't make rent this month, but if doing so will jeopardize your own financial situation then don't be afraid to say no. If they're truly your friend they'll understand and won't hold it against you. 
TrinixDMorrison	So wait, I'm gonna die a painful death at a point I was supposed to die naturally? Like, instead of dying in my sleep in my 90s surrounded by my family I'll die in a car accident when I'm 90? Cuz if that's the case I'll take it; a painful death is still a death, not like I'm going to be experiencing prolonged torture for a few weeks. 
TrinixDMorrison	Some people will claim they're recording evidence that can be used later in court or insurance claims, but they're not fooling anyone; they just want to reap imaginary internet points. 
TrinixDMorrison	> I think society prefers to sort by detrimental attributes more so than assets.  Man if that isn't the truth...it's why we have people with mindsets like "I'm broke because I made a bunch of unwise decisions, but instead of working towards a solution I'm going to find other people who are just as poor as I am and then hate on successful people for being rich" and "I'm fat and unattractive because I eat a whole cake every night before bed and don't work out, but rather than trying to get fit I'm going to find other people who are just as fat as I am and bully random skinny people on facebook for posting gym selfies"
TrinixDMorrison	It's rather infuriating how this kid thinks he's some sort of a selfmade success when really it was his dead grandma's money.

Reloh	Whats a quote from your favorite show that only a hardcore fan will recognize? | 
Reloh	"Ooh I'm a bad boy, a bad boy. Put some vegetable oil on it, make it feel better"
Reloh	Is that spongebob? I know that was definitely a thing in spongebob but I'm not sure if that's what you're referencing. 
Reloh	MICHAEL!
Reloh	Goddammit Jack Bauer. You really are the man
Reloh	I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT GUY SAID IN THE SECOND COMMENT THREAD!
Reloh	I just beat the main game of dark souls 3... It's not the hardest thing ever done by any means, but for me, even finishing a game, and that game being dark souls. I was super proud of myself. 
Reloh	Don't you mean the blood dome?
Reloh	Are your residents 6?
Reloh	Got a new laptop and went to download Hey ya from the email link, is there a working download? | [removed]

Reloh	LPT: When driving an unfamiliar car, most models will have a triangle on one side of the fuel gauge, this indicates which side of the car the tank is filled from. | [removed]
Reloh	This is the person we all know is in the other end of the mic. But then we go, ahhhh. Maybe theyre attractive and don't look like a balding 45 year old man mixed with a small child. But no... It's always this 
Reloh	Ayy there it is, thank you
Reloh	did, cant find anything. idk
Reloh	Does anyone have a link to start//end?
Reloh	Doea anyone have a copy of thr always sunny 3 frame fingering meme with the night man | I need to show it to my friends so bad. Much appreciation for any help 
Reloh	Joseph Anderson does incredibly well thought out and in depth game reviews. His videos are such high quality (after the first few where they had the same content but poor mic quality) that I've watched every video, even if I'm not interested in the game. I would highly recommend checking out his channel, some videos last a couple hours, and while there aren't many, it should be able to keep you busy for a YouTube adventure
Reloh	So jot that down | 
Reloh	wut...
Reloh	Im probably on the low end, but I have 50 hours in stardew valley, and most of that was put in during the first week i had it, amazing game IMO
Reloh	Good, I just need some content. Been a drought without him 
Reloh	In Buffalo, buying from the stadium made the most expensive ticket prices $66, so i don't know that its anything to do with the band, and might be the place your going to see them. Sorry to hear thats a barrier for you.
Reloh	Out of the loop on Vertigo, can someone explain? | been distracted with things and havent been checking the sub, can someone explain Vertigo to me please, apparently an album/EP, so release date too?
Reloh	Wow that was a pretty great reply, thanks. I'm just hoping for new music I guess, been almost exactly a year since ITYTTMOM and i'd love some new music from him. Seems like him to include some subtle hints as he goes along. I guess i'll just keep fingers crossed for new music soon.
Reloh	Promises are nothing more than feeding fires
Reloh	In my opinion it was a fine closer. The first time i heard it I was smiling, and while i believe the song could use one more verse in it instead of an extended chorus at the end, i think its a pretty good song. If you need to view it as a meaning, have it be that now the albums done, and Dan can finally relax and you are able to join him, dancing in the dark. Putting it in the middle of the album, I dont know if that would have made any sense. While yesterday might be their most experimental, this song is certainly different from anything on the album, and it being separated in a sense feels right. These are of course just my opinions though.
Reloh	Huh... really? either way i really like the line, but yeah, its I'll Make it up to you
Reloh	What do you consider the most unique song that you have ever created (That has been released on an album or EP)  Also will you guys please play Dream at the Buffalo Concert November 1st, Thanks I know you'll pull through haha!
Reloh	"The pop of S+M"  did we listen to different albums?
Reloh	That song was most likely made so that the members of the band could bang (their respective partners not eachother) to their own music, its got that vibe for sure. I personally am in love with the first part, i find myself singing the weird vocals at the beginning when im not listening to music and am drawn back to it even though at my base im still confused. I think its really good inits own respect and a fine closer.
Reloh	This comment made me question if I liked them as a band... just because of this comment 
Reloh	kool /s
Reloh	Congrats! Still got 11 hours on the east coast of the US and I haven't listened to the leak
Reloh	 "And NO. He didn't disenchant all the cards, never."  "Only me and my son were home, and Butters isn't allowed to fly the drone without my permission. So it must have flown itself!"

Reloh	LPT - Right clicking on a youtube video will bring up a menu that allows you to put a video on loop | Just in case you would need to do that for some reason ;P
Reloh	Shout out to making this post 1.5 hours before it was released lol
Reloh	Looks like it wasn't an error. In case you're behind the song was released less than an hour ago
Reloh	Going off 5 hours of sleep, rough day at work and Imagine Dragons drops a new song to wipe all of that out. This song is amazing. I love it.
Reloh	I got tired of clicking replay :p
Reloh	Imagine Dragons - Walking The Wire | 
Reloh	Yo nice! my friend and I are going to the buffalo event too! Went the last time they came through. Enjoy it!
Reloh	Nope, I can respect people for liking it, but it's not my type of song and the side of imagine dragons I don't really like. Don't even have it saved on my spotify. Really reinforced after whatever it takes which I'm in love with 
Reloh	He didn't mean that... it's just the salt after the Yogg | 
Reloh	Add smash 64 and melee to that list. Still kicking around today with a large and dedicated fanbase
Reloh	Oh my god, best song
Reloh	"died for the third time"  Oh boy, I've been on sister friede for about a month now playing on and off, probably died 70 times or so. Three is nothing there young one.
Reloh	We're pretty lucky wood burns so easily, or the start of mankind would have been a whole lot more rough. | 
Reloh	I'm determined to solo her since ive come this far, I can get to stage three nearly every time, with stage one being the trickier of 1 and 2, but damn she is unrelenting. With the semester ending, her time dwindles haha

Reloh	Problems creating a 4 bit comparator (new) | hi, i am a sophomore computer science major, we have been tasked with creating a 4 bit comparator in structural verilog. I'm wondering what is wrong with my code, I get syntax errors as soon as i start using gates and i honestly have no idea whats happening. Thanks, it's probably be an easy fix.   Task: https://gyazo.com/06b5508f4d67c7c3e33de8d29b4efbd6 Code: https://gyazo.com/832137712ddc2bffba16ab3bdf6afb03
Reloh	Wow, I just wanna say congrats for recognizing what the drugs were doing to you and deciding to cut them out. 10 years sober is an incredible accomplishment. As others have said, you were tricked into drinking it, you still retain your sobriety, if anything it was your sister using again through another outlet. This may be an innapropriate question, and if so, someone let me know, but after 10 years, if you "relapse", i recognize in your case it was 100% unintentional and thats awful, does your body revert almost to the original day you quit? I clearly have no struggles with addiction, and was just wondering what the experience will be like, with you continuing forward. Keep it up, we all believe in you. I hope everything works out for you, and those children, you're doing all you can.
Reloh	So... Whatever it takes is really good, and i'm so happy about it. | Loved believer, and hated Thunder, i know a lot of people liked it and im thrilled for all of you, but I was very worried about my tastes and the future of the album, but this song seems to make up for the lack of lyrics in Thunder, i absolutely love it, and the new sound mixed with the heavy amount of lyrics is great for me. Really looking forward to this album again.
Reloh	Nothing against you liking thunder, however i feel like this song is most comparable to polaroid... super different from the rest of S+M, but i also loved that song, doesnt mean theyre departing from it, believer was a lot more similar to that i feel.
Reloh	I know others have commented. But OP it's really incredible to see you responding to every post someone has made. I watched Bo Burnham's make happy this weekend as I always do when I'm sad and his last song always makes me tear up, I'm gonna count that. Maybe it doesn't help that its my go to when I'm feeling bad :/
Reloh	Is this a spongebob reference?? With the pie bomb?
Reloh	Blizzard implementing their new UI updates | 
Reloh	He didn't actually say it, it's just what Mac is saying happened. But you're not wrong, Frank is fucking amazing 
Reloh	What's the quickest way you've seen someone destroy their life? | 
Reloh	Workers of reddit, what was your, "I don't get paid enough for this shit" moment? | 
Reloh	I still realllly don't like it. And I've played it for people to get their opinions... and they realllly don't like it. And my best friend, who we went to their s+m concert, realllly doesn't like it. Not that anyone is wrong.... but I really don't like it
Reloh	No, not everything has to relate to our fucking ancestors. Monsters are scary as shit and under the bed is one of the two places we can't see, the other being the closet.
Reloh	I just imagine him telling this story to those Asians on the boat ride.  "One of my favorite things is bangin whoors"
Reloh	Experiment: post your favorite ID album, favorite song from the album, and your opinions on thunder | With the divide among fans, i'm assuming that those who favor night visions will like the song and list something like tiptoe, and for those who like s+m and would list say, gold or I'm so sorry, this song would be a disappointment where believer was not. Just checking our a small experiment. Feel free to have discussions below. 
Reloh	Oh man this hurts to see. Polaroid is so lyric heavy. Sure it has its course often, but it's so different. The entire song flows. This song is just the word thunder with a couple sentences thrown in.
Reloh	As a starting point I loooovvved smoke + mirrors. Took a while for me to, but it was so much better IMO than night visions (not saying that I didn't like it). Due to this, when believer came out, from the first listen I loved it, which apparently most people did not. But it fit the gold, I'm so sorry mold so well and I fell in love and had some really high hopes for the future. Im really disappointed in this song and its lack of depth, it's lack of lyrics. As far as I can remember, this is the first song they've released about how they've succeeded, focusing on them being successful, and it's so lyrically lacking that I can't move past it... just not what i expected from them. It's not a ruiner. But I definitely wouldn't say I like it, and personally, I hope they stick to the believer direction with this album, with some songs such as thunder for the people who enjoy them. But thunder isn't the imagine dragons that i love.
Reloh	I guess this comes from which album you liked more? I'm assuming you guys liked night visions. As someone who loved smoke + mirrors. This seems really far from what my image of image dragons is and believer was right at their core. A gritty, base heavy alternative style, I loved it, and this song with its lack of vocals. ( I mean seriously, the amount of times it just says thunder is ridiculous...) believer was so much better for me and right what I was hoping for some the beginning. Let me know if the night visions vs s+m thought is true
Reloh	You know what it is bitch | 
Reloh	Auchenai + reno
Reloh	I love BM kibbler of Kibbler gaming trying to keep it all together as the monitor pans over the picture. Eventually it just gets to be too much and breaks him
Reloh	you have a right to not like the deck, but with how agressive nearly every deck is now, its pretty unreasonable to assume a mage wont be at 1hp for a decent portion of the game. You may not like the block aspect, but its the only thing keeping them alive. for a class not to be able to deal 1 damage is not likely. 
Reloh	Anyone else really tired of other classes getting ice block? | [removed]
Reloh	I'm by no means an artist and have like, 0 experience. But it looks like the light is coming from the right side due to the brightness, However the shadow is also on the side which is confusing. However no one else brought it up so I'm probably wrong. Either way, looks good. Love me some Walt 
Reloh	Bro I feel this. I had a test today in CSE 305. 2 years in and I still don't k ow hoe to study for this stuff. You just know it or you don't. C++ isn't bad though.

Reloh	2 Big tests coming up and feeling very behind on both, what are some tips to help a usual procrastinator? | I'm one of the people who has always done well in school without studying much. I'm a sophomore in college, with 2 tests coming up on Tuesday and Wednesday. One is a class for my major (comp. sci) and the other is for economics. I feel so behind in the classes that im not sure what to do. I have the materials to get through it, but have next to no study habits and if im being honest with myself, a pretty bad attention span for studying. economics by the way ive found i hate so there is next to no motivation there. I guess im just looking for some tips to help ensure that i can get through the material. i always seem to drop the ball and was wondering if there was some magic tip out there i could get from Reddit. Thanks
Reloh	This is the furthest thing from family guy. The first season is just as good as the premiere, you wont be dipping in quality to go back and watch the whole thing, plus theres only 2 full seasons of 20 minute episodes, so its not like its a time commitment.
Reloh	Not sure it was a gift. Pretty sure she got it online somewhere 
Reloh	foudn it, was always checking the outskirts instead of the center
Reloh	Cant seem to unlock the sister Fried fight... (not the popular DLC) | just bought the season pass and am playing through the first DLC, i think ive made it through the whole level, killed the other boss and the wolf, explored all over, unlocked what i assume to be all the bonfires, but sister fried remains non hostile, im not sure what to do. Any help or common problems would be appreciated.
Reloh	Amazing song, seeing them play it live is something special, so much emotion in it. 
Reloh	Season 18 <3
Reloh	Trying to play xbox without my 250 gb hard drive | i left my HDD at home on accident (250 GB), i have all the games digitally bought so i should be able to download them, however i cant get past the title update, i have a 16 gb flash drive in there now, but it wont save to it, is there any way to get my 360 up and running without the HDD?
Reloh	You clearly still have feelings for her. Or at least from everything I've read. You had your chance and completely cut her off. Even if you guys became friends, that's a hard thing to forget. Yeah, the boyfriend might not have wanted her talking to you, but with the way you worded your post. "I'm in love with her" I'd argue it's the right call on his part.
Reloh	Wrong sub
Reloh	Yeah, the end of the series was the SpongeBob movie for me. Anything before then is amazing. Anything after, for the most part at least, I try and not associate. They did it well. But I love the part about just running band geeks again. Honestly nothing would make me happier.
Reloh	Does the Xbox one 500 GB and 1 TB model use the same power supply cord? | Planning on using a different cord for a bit, just want to make sure there is no difference between the models in terms of power supply. Dont know why there would be
Reloh	Just finished my first run of the game | This was my first game of the dark souls catagory, and i absolutely loved it. I honestly only really got interested after watching a review by Joseph Anderson, but man am i glad i decided to give it a try. No other game has felt as rewarding as this to master. Getting through most of the bosses solo was also a huge accomplishment i feel i had earned. The knowledge that you had mastered an area and its creatures and the boss is like nothing else. This was a fantastic first experience (playing on Xbox) and the next game i want to play, desperately, is bloodborne. have a few friends with PS4's so hopefully that can be setup. On to the option now of starting ng+ or going back and finding the bosses i may have missed. Just wanted to share that ii love this game, everything it has to offer, and i cant wait to explore more titles from the series.
Reloh	An accurate commentary and reaction to the reno pirate meta | 
Reloh	I think i actually know the exact gesture one you are talking about. I tried quite a few next to them trying to replicate it but nothing ever happened. i was dissapointed. But thank you! i have seen some of these. but others sound new
Reloh	Yeah, taht would be great! i dont know how to tell you which ones ive beaten though :/ 
Reloh	Yeah they are both xbox one standard models.
Reloh	I got one and have never played witcher before, however i do play other card games, but nothing on my xbox other than witch that would have linked me to it i believe.
Reloh	This is an xbox subreddit. bruh
Reloh	Left my power cord / brick at school, anyone know of a work around? | Wondering if theres anywhere i can pick up a temporary one, or if theres a way to buy one and then just return at the end of the week (kind of scummy, but im not above it...) dont know how i was so dumb

onceagainwehavethat	Alt right was a term created in 2016 when memelords from 4chan began to be investigated by mainstream media channels like CNN, and were mistakenly taken at face value. Alt left appears to be a term invented in August of 2017 by the President of the United States.
onceagainwehavethat	I'd say that most "heroes" from before c. 1960 were "assholes" by 2017 standards since their morality wouldn't line up at all with yours and therefore you'd think they were a bigoted asshole.

onceagainwehavethat	Let's be honest here, this revival of White Supremacy has little if any ties to Christianity. The only major right-wing political figure who hasn't officially denounced white supremacy after the Charlottesville attack is Trump, and he doesn't even know how to pronounce biblical verses. All the major right-wing Evangelical fundies like Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz have strongly condemned White Supremacy in the last few hours.   Also, you'll notice that many White Supremacists online (particularly on the biggest WS board Stormfront) are either atheistic, agnostic, or "neopagan" in their beliefs; in the case of the latter many of them tie their White Nationalism in with the pre-Christian pagan beliefs of Europe and blame Christianity on "brownwashing" Europe with its Middle Eastern-originating religion.

onceagainwehavethat	To be fair I don't think r/canada is on a hate against Natives themselves, maybe just the ridiculous identity politics cloud of "white vs. indigenous" rhetoric that seemed to overtake and dampen Canada 150 celebrations, even through the PM himself.  What should have been a celebratory time for this country was more about white guilt and taking blame for the sins of our ancestors that had no more to do with whites today than Germans today have to do with the Nazis of a couple of generations ago.   The PM using terms like "we" and "our", as if the average white Canadian had anything to do with these past sins, or has anything to do with the responsibility of reparations today, was despicable... that's HIS responsibility, the government's responsibility, not the common citizen. Yet the rhetoric clearly was aimed at pitting everyday citiizen whites of European heritage against the indigenous. Yet another cultural meme-du-jour we've adopted from America of pitting one arbitrarily defined racial or ethnic group against another.
onceagainwehavethat	Well when the Prime Minister spends about 95% of his Canada Day speeches talking about how oppressed Natives are and how evil Canada has been toward them, can you really blame Natives for getting this kind of attitude?   Our next PM can't come soon enough, maybe this time one that isn't just a glorified celebrity figure spouting left-wing identity politic whines.

onceagainwehavethat	There are occasions where he'd wear them while out with his towering former wives Nicole Kidman or Katie Holmes, but often the ones he wore were much less extreme and ugly than the endless collection of terrible lifts wore by the world's King of Height Insecurity, RDJ.
onceagainwehavethat	Hmm, but doesn't this very picture imply that Tom isn't wearing lifts? I've never seen Efron wear them so it's safe to assume he isn't in this picture, and since he's 5'8" and Tom's 5'7", Tom is the exact height he would be without lifts in this image.

onceagainwehavethat	Could be that, or it could be that she's dated some insecure shorter men who wouldn't allow her to wear heels because of the insecurity. I'm sure both possibilities are common enough.
onceagainwehavethat	Canada - we're collectively VERY touchy about our accents
onceagainwehavethat	Cool, but one observation I'll make - the only wide shot that shows us this man standing directly in opposition to a woman from a straight angle employs a woman that is exactly his height, not a centimeter taller...   Every other shot, while certainly showing women who are visibly taller than him, doesn't juxtapose it in the traditional wide shot intersecting angle like the last shot with the shortest woman. (lotta low upward angles and so forth...)  It's a step in the right direction, but clearly they still hesitate to violate the taboo completely.
onceagainwehavethat	>Would you? I personally would.  Why the hell would you do that? Leg-lengthening surgery might be risky and expensive but it's almost certain not to lower your lifespan by 20 years... I'd go for that long before taking a more "proportional" height increase, since clothes can help with that anyway and no one sees proportions in a club in the dark.  This is like asking someone if they'd rather take 20 years off their life or have small breasts.... guess what, there's another solution mate!  I guess the only exceptions would be for men 5'3" or shorter, where the maximum leg-lengthening still wouldn't make you very tall and would really screw up proportions. But for anyone 5'4" or higher it'd be a stupid deal to make.

onceagainwehavethat	Go easy on them bruh, millennials aren't as familiar with recognizing an "outside" scenario
onceagainwehavethat	Eh, I saw this video the other day and I disagree with your assessment. I think when they mentioned height as being unethical to change, they almost meant it as an insult in the sense of "why should short men get to breed tall people?".   Unlike eye color, there aren't a multitude of options that are generally all subjectively viewed differently... it's either short, or tall, or average... and who in the hell in this culture would "choose" their offspring to be short?
onceagainwehavethat	> I generally think a good line for that is the average female height of around 5'4" 5'3"... men who are at that height or shorter have exponentially less dating success and more prejudice against them for height.  Agreed, but with the advent of high-heels I'd say this so-called line of terribleness is increasing more and more all the time. That picture of those two fans with Taylor Lautner who is 5'9 is a great example of that. When 5'9 men are out anywhere where women are generally wearing heels, they will be shorter or equal height to a very large proportion of the women.
onceagainwehavethat	Not exactly, but one observation I noticed involved when I wore lifts (yeah yeah, shame me all you want).  I see my extended family for the first time in a year or so (at a public place where shoes aren't removed), and in these shoes I've gone from 5'7.75" to about 5'10" and all of a sudden I keep getting comments like "oh wow you're so tall" or "wow honey look at him he's taller than you", or "lucky you got the height unlike your dad!" and all in a positive way. Our family is generally short, but we have some sprouters... one of my 16-year-old cousins is already 6'4" and constantly got comments all evening about how tall he was and how good of a thing that is!   No one ever gets comments about being short, unless explicitly as an insult... probably because it would just be taken as an insult otherwise. Sigh.

onceagainwehavethat	Hmm, I double-checked, [virtually exact identical heights](http://i.imgur.com/LyyfiYU.png)... this almost makes me wonder a bit further about if maybe he was slightly shorter than her, but they elevated him artificially just to avoid that taboo breaker.
onceagainwehavethat	I'm 5'8" and I'll be the first to admit there's nothing quite like trying shoe lifts for the first time... even if you don't agree with the idea that short men should be wearing them everywhere in public, just trying them on in your own home and walking around can be quite an experience. It's easy to "become shorter" whenever you want because you just have to bend your knees, but "becoming taller" isn't something we normally get to experience outside of having elevator shoes/heels. Tiptoes isn't the same, either.... and it's hard to walk around like that. I'd recommend giving it a try.
onceagainwehavethat	Shoe lifts only really work for men who are in the 5'7" to 5'9" range... that's the only time you get any benefit from them, since you go from being short to being at least average.
onceagainwehavethat	I'm the OP of that post... I guess even hinting that any transgender person said something negative is a big no-no on reddit, but posts on the front page drenched with heightphobia (fuck it, that's a word now) don't ever seem to be an issue.
onceagainwehavethat	No, it got delisted manually by the mods/admins, you can tell by its absence in the chronological record (as Geoffrey mentioned) and the removal of the thumbnail image. And as of currently it appears to have a +5 upvote ranking, so it's not been downvoted to oblivion.
onceagainwehavethat	Yes well the point is how ironic it is that people are so concerned about the plights transwomen face yet no one gives a shit about short men, despite the fact that this video shows that we have it the worst, by far, in the dating world. The chick in this video could still get hundreds of sex partners, even if she had to settle for a poor old lowly leprechaun who is a mere 5'10".
onceagainwehavethat	Yes I do agree with you on this, I'm not posting this trying to be a trans-hating shitbag, I'm just trying to show the hypocrisy.
onceagainwehavethat	And let me just add... the fact that this post is getting downvoted to shit is even more pathetic, imagine in a subreddit for black people, if a video was posted where someone said "it's hard to find someone who's into me and isn't black".... and it got DOWNVOTED by its own subscribers because "OMG preference, how dare you judge her for rejecting the idea of dating us lowly black people".
onceagainwehavethat	Let's reword what she said to other "preferences" then:  "I'm also super insecure about my race, I'm black, and it's hard to find people that are into me and white"  "I'm also super insecure about my nationality, I'm Indian and it's hard to find people that are into me and American"  "I'm also super insecure about my weight, I'm fat, and it's hard to find people that are into me and in shape"  "I'm also super insecure about my vagina, it's super huge and it's hard to find people who are into me with huge dicks"  None of those things would be defended by anyone.  But when people say short men, it's a-ok and even people on our side like you come to their defense.
onceagainwehavethat	Poor trans girl is insecure about her height because she can't "find a guy taller than her", oh noes! | 
onceagainwehavethat	Kinda ironic that you are calling people transphobic when your very comment would be considered transphobic by most of mainstream society.

onceagainwehavethat	>Casting Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell wasn't racist  >unlike movies such as Exodus: Gods and Kings, which I DO think [are] racist  I am in complete opposition to this opinion, to be honest. Johansson is portraying a character that, whether she can "change appearances" or not, is clearly an Asian character from a recently published original source, and especially given the lack of lead roles given to Asians in American/Hollywood cinema despite the plethora of options available, it was a disgrace to have the role given to a white person (or really to any race other than Asian).  Exodus: Gods and Kings on the other hand, portrays individuals who may or may not have been fictional, many of whom that are known to exist were indeed actually white, or close enough to white as we currently define it.   Additionally, Western art and cinema has historically portrayed these roles using white people so the sudden outrage against continuing to do so is puzzling to me. I believe this all stems from that "scientific" depiction of Jesus that came out a few years back that depicted him as a lowly brown-skinned man... which was based on nothing other than speculation. Since then, this line of thinking has snowballed to the point that continuing a centuries-old tradition of depicting Jesus or other biblical figures as white (or as the given predominant race of the geographical area producing the film/art) is seen as preposterous.   Jesus and other biblical figures are myths of our creation, even if they were based on real-life original people... because the image we associate with them has evolved and been transformed over millennia to meet a certain image. Jesus in the West is known to have long flowing hair, a slightly feminine appearance, a robe and sash, sandals, being tall, a beard, dreamy eyes, and yes... whiteness.   So casting a white man to portray him or other biblical figures is not nearly as egregious as taking a modern Asian film depicting an Asian character and changing that character to be white. Plus, finding a Middle Eastern man resembling peoples from that region circa the 1st century to star in your 2017 film is slightly more difficult and implausible than finding an Asian person from the 20th century to star in it.
onceagainwehavethat	Is it acceptable to cast a black British actor as a black American slave? Oh right, it's already been done and no one has a problem with it. Are you deliberately trying to start a racist flame war here?
onceagainwehavethat	If that were to occur it would be as ridiculous as people getting irate over the endless onslaught of British white men portraying American white characters, or British black men portraying American black characters. I'll concede that the suggestion that Chinese and Japanese people might look similar to each other is indeed considered "racist" by American PC standards, but yet somehow suggesting blacks or whites of differing nationalities look similar is just fine.  And no, Chinese people wouldn't get pissed off about it, maybe *Chinese-Americans* would, since these politically correct types of attitudes are basically non-existent in non-western nations.
onceagainwehavethat	According to who? I'm sure someone would rant about it, but you wouldn't see that person rant about Chiwetel Ejiofor.
onceagainwehavethat	Certainly it would be viewed less negatively than casting a white person. Would a person of specifically-Japanese ancestry be preferable? Sure.   But just like casting a black Brit as an American slave rather than casting a white American, it makes more sense to cast a Chinese actress in this role than a white actress.
onceagainwehavethat	If "white people" can be considered a monolith singular race based on stereotypical appearance and features, so can "Asian people".
onceagainwehavethat	> I'm sorry but there's no way anyone in the Bible was white. It's set in the Middle East.  Middle Eastern people can be white, it's not some monolith race over there.  >there is a history of them being depicted as white, but this is because much of the West places value on whiteness and associates it with purity  Right, I'm sure it's nothing to do with the fact that Western nations have been historically white and therefore the cast of films was composed primarily of white people? Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps their casting intentions were less racist-influenced than many social justice activists' seem to be today, and were instead just a product of circumstance?  >I don't want to make a judgement about whether or not you're a racist based on a few paragraphs posted on reddit, but I would suggest avoiding phrases such as "lowly brown-skinned man" if this is not the impression you want to give.  I don't want to make a judgment on your literacy based on a few sentences on Reddit, but I suggest looking up the term "lowly" in a dictionary. 
onceagainwehavethat	Japanese is associated with nationality not with race... just like I wouldn't say a historically Black-American character "should be portrayed by an American", I'd say "should be portrayed by a black person", since Americans can be white, black, etc.   I don't decide the pop culture words for different races, I just employ them in my language. "Asian" is considered a term for a particular race.
onceagainwehavethat	Terrorism was more associated with Arabs than Islam per se (depictions of stereotypical Arabs as terrorists before 2001 was rarely associated with Islam), and any public consciousness of Islam was moreso associated with figures that were well-respected in America such as Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Cat Stevens. There was still the bigoted "towelhead" slur employed against Muslims, but not necessarily specifically, as Sikhs were often under the same umbrella of such insults.
onceagainwehavethat	Just noticed Emilio Estevez had on HUGE lifts during the film "Loaded Weapon" | 
onceagainwehavethat	Yup... their "technology" here is basically a souped-up facial recognition algorithm that tries to deduce gender based on stereotypical appearances of female vs. male.

The first character, the lady who dies at the beginning, we are told she is Muslim but we get the "excuse" that she was told about pre-Islamic Egyptian gods as a child therefore that's who she sees when she dies instead of Muhammad/Allah? Ok....  Then the other gentleman is [from a nation where homosexuality is punishable by law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Oman), but glaringly absent is any mention or acknowledgement of Islam, instead only yet ANOTHER pre-Islamic pagan god is introduced to the character.

onceagainwehavethat	We both know that if this was a x-tian or Jewish bomber no one would say "Religion of Peace®" bullshit because they know those religions have good eggs and bad eggs... the reason it happens with Islam is because of racist xenophobe attitudes to brown people because they are "different".

onceagainwehavethat	Oh, please spare me with the sarcastic "religion of peace" moniker... why are there so many racists on this sub? Notice the part of this headline where this suicide bomber targeted an ISLAMIC MOSQUE?

Atcollins1993	You asked what you should upgrade next. I gave you my opinion. There are better options than Benzema in FIFA meta. Griezmann is one of them.
Atcollins1993	Why
Atcollins1993	Drake.
Atcollins1993	Price? Link? Amazon!?   Fucking awesome compared to what I'm rocking
Atcollins1993	Cost a little to start, but get into fishing! 
Atcollins1993	Very neat. What's your preferred bait? Just curious. Live or artificial? And what kind of each? I'm in Connecticut. I fish Largemouth, the closest we have to what you're doing are our Striper runs - hence the curiousity
Atcollins1993	What else do you catch out there? What are the common bites?
Atcollins1993	Girlfriend wants to know if he went to jail for that 
Atcollins1993	Suave
Atcollins1993	Little did that fish know that he just hooked you for life
Atcollins1993	Made me chuckle - thanks!
Atcollins1993	Can we get an image or any sort of validation?
Atcollins1993	I hear you bro. Soon enough! Just gotta hang tight. Should be pretty good at it by now, considering all things prior (:

Pablo_Eskobar	How do I get a live tv signal onto a webpage? | Total noob here but wondering if anyone's got a guide on how to get a live tv signal onto a webpage. Yes, I'm aware of the illegalities around this but nonetheless, I'd like to see how it's set up. Can't get any good sources via google, I may be searching the wrong terms.
Pablo_Eskobar	I'd probably be straight up and admit we've neglected the space but we're renewing our efforts of late and will be posting and communicating with people again. I find  honesty is the best practice.
Pablo_Eskobar	App for finding unfollowers on Instagram | I've had a few and all pretty much useless now, so what are people's favorite apps for finding unfollowers?
Pablo_Eskobar	Either
Pablo_Eskobar	> displaypurposes.com  Cheers for this one, discover something new everyday :) 
Pablo_Eskobar	yeah like that with a while for me. Makes the app redundunant for me. I want to see what's posted now not 24hrs ago.  
Pablo_Eskobar	I've 11k followers 😂 I did do that in the early days though
Pablo_Eskobar	What's your funniest scene from a movie ever? | 
Pablo_Eskobar	U OK hun
Pablo_Eskobar	What's the funniest movie scene you seen? | [removed]
Pablo_Eskobar	The culture that has been lost worldwide because of colonialism always astounds me. Humans can be such pieces of shit.  
Pablo_Eskobar	Google + | Are people still using it to drive traffic? Is there much success with it?  Seems to have died a death in my social circles.
Pablo_Eskobar	My solution was to place the image I want to use on the webpage your linking to, in the Open Graph settings. Have you access to the webpage? I mean to edit the html?
Pablo_Eskobar	I've noticed the image I used in the ads manager wasn't been used once I created the post. That drove me over to Facebook itself to manually do it but was unable to. 
Pablo_Eskobar	FACEBOOK CHANGES | Anyone else noticing a change on Facebook when creating a post on a business page. I used to input a link and then change the image by uploading what I needed rather than what was chosen from the crawl, now the crawl is overriding what I upload. Any work arounds?
Pablo_Eskobar	I missed that memo. Looks like there pushing us to place the image on the Web page itself so.

Pablo_Eskobar	Feel like you could simplify this to create a trump font. Use the centre hair as an abstract T and blend together with the rest of the characters, similar to the star wars font. OK I need some sleep now 
Pablo_Eskobar	Site & Facebook branding | Interested to hear people's thoughts on this. I work as a social media manager and maintain the Facebook page of a number of pubs. I update the sites weekly and create content for FB. However, the original Web designer is trying to dictate the graphics styling for Fb an trying to have them similar to the site. It sounds ideal but the graphic on site are very generic. My own view is that the Facebook page should be a lot more personal, even with the imagery. Example - the site entertainment section has generic images with dates and names of upcoming acts, whilst the Fb version will be an promo image of the act with their face in there if possible. Shouldn't Fb be a chance to do it less generic and slightly different? 
Pablo_Eskobar	Facebook Cover Videos | Anyone having much luck with cover videos? I'm getting the option and have uploaded but it shows as a single frame from the video. Still in early stages or just buggy as hell?
Pablo_Eskobar	Giving credit doesn't absolve copyright thieves. Where does it state anything about necessary credit? I'd always follow the original creator. Be original and create your own quality content and building a following will come naturally combined with some networking 
Pablo_Eskobar	Copying an image (which is required to repost) = breaking copyright laws, at least where I'm from. This is why Insta will remove offending images if requested. 
Pablo_Eskobar	I'm sure you can but I go out of my way to not follow these accounts. Besides, even with accreditation they're are still breaking copyright.

Pablo_Eskobar	Instagram Business Account Post Throttling | Can't really find anything anywhere online about this. I'm assuming Instagram are going to go the same route as Facebook did with throttling business pages posts, in order to drive their profits. With some FB posts reaching low percentages organically, is there an evidence that Instagram has gone or is going down this route?
Pablo_Eskobar	Suppose it was always the way it going to go. Haven't control of enough sizeable accounts to get that info, so thank you 
Pablo_Eskobar	Is a blog with images and extremely limited copy any good for SEO? | I'm working on readjusting a website in which part of it has a blog that I'd like to remove. Mainly because I think it has no value to SEO. It has hardly any copy and its posts are never pushed out to social media. However, the guy I'm working with wants to leave it be as he says it may catch some long-tailed keywords. But if it has no copy how can it catch any keywords? 
Pablo_Eskobar	So would you remove it? :) 
Pablo_Eskobar	Can anyone still use a button on a video post? | Using the workaround for posting 'learn more' buttons with video posts, via the editor. Now it's gone, has anyone still got access to it or is it gone for good this time?
Pablo_Eskobar	Americans of reddit, what is the one food item available mainly in the US that you crave for when abroad? | 
Pablo_Eskobar	I'm just at the end of a 3 day trial with growth pup. Don't know what there prices are like but in the 3 days I've picked up about 100-150 new followers. They're targeted but time will tell if they're solid and interactive followers. 
Pablo_Eskobar	Grateful for feedback on this. It's for a website that covers Ladies Gaelic Football. For anyone outside Ireland it's a sport similar to soccer but the ball can be carried in the hand too. |

Some on the youtube thread got it working again today following my system but about an hour it's stopped again, looks like a bug but more likely FB acting the dicks
Pablo_Eskobar	Using a video instead of image from a facebook scrape | When I drop a url into a facebook post the webpage is crawled for images or I can choose to upload a different one at that point. My question is how can I use a video in this instance? I've found an instance of this technique but I don't get the option to create something similar, you can see the technique in this image http://imgur.com/a/G7Qmd   I'm wondering is this post the remnants of an advert or boosted post because it doesn't highlight 'sponsored' anywhere. Essentially what I'm trying to achieve is drop a video into a post while also having a link to the website in a clean manner such as the image I've linked to. Any suggestions folks?
Pablo_Eskobar	Just kept tinkering with it. Tried the video option instead of the link option when creating a post and it still didn't give the CTA choice. But once u select link option it gives u what's needed. From what I read online people think they've removed the option from the original way, which they have, so I don't know if it was just a switch to this method or they just haven't got around to removing it fully yet. Either way enjoy it while it's there!!!!
Pablo_Eskobar	OK I've figured it out :) follow these steps. Go to power editor (I think it can only be done through here) hamburger menu in top left select 'page posts' dropdown underneath the hamburger select the page you want to post on. Then select 'published posts' Then 'create post' button over on the right hand side. You have to select 'link' and input your destination link, button type, description, title and upload video. The last option at the bottom select 'only use this for advert' Then create post. You'll then need to select advert posts on the right and you'll see the add you just created. Select the checkbox to highlight, then the 'actions' dropdown you'll see publish!. Hey presto :)  
Pablo_Eskobar	I don't thin he's verfied but yes good shout it may well be something along those lines, cheers for the suggestions
Pablo_Eskobar	OK not sure we're talking about the same thing. Check this guys pinned post, it's a video with a learn more button underneath linking to his site. It's different to what you're highlighting in that he's got that learn more button without being a sponsored advert https://www.facebook.com/pg/RobertPowerPage/posts/?ref=page_internal
Pablo_Eskobar	Not seeing that technique on those facebook pages, although there's numerous Capital FM's around the world so not sure we're looking at the same page. I'll have to keep digging!
Pablo_Eskobar	Hmmm... Damn facebook anyway. It's the first time I've seen it used and I have a client who's hoping to use the same layout. Wonder if there's a work around for it. 
Pablo_Eskobar	Can I link to a bootstrap modal at the end of a funnel? | I'm creating a funnel with three steps and I need the third to be a click on a BOOK NOW button which is actually a link to a bootstrap modal.

Pablo_Eskobar	Should I remove ad | For a certain search term a business I manage is first in SERPS there's an ad word campaign set up in which the the business appears in the results as an advert.

Pablo_Eskobar	The audio needs a lot of work. It's extremely rushed and in some parts the background music overpowers the voice-over.

RickyWicky	Chefs of reddit, or just people who love cooking, what are some useful tips for beginners in the kitchen when preparing a meal? | 
RickyWicky	I assume the "no handle" means if a knife is falling, don't try to stop it?
RickyWicky	What is the benefit of doing this?
RickyWicky	LPT: Fry bacon clothed, make bacon naked.  Edit: accidentally typed "baking" instead of bacon.
RickyWicky	A 75 watt Peavey amp. I've only ever used it with headphones. I haven't used it in about 5 months.
RickyWicky	I am embarrassed to say that I only realised how sarcastic this comment is when I got to the "good atmosphere" point. Well done!
RickyWicky	My dad did exactly this a few years ago. 
RickyWicky	I want to cook for my family (of 3) and we are all intolerant of something, be it dairy (me) or gluten (my mom) or starch (my dad, gets acid reflux). So I'd likely start with things like chicken and veggies and stuff. There are a ton of amazing recipes for chicken, so that seems like a no brainer.   However, do you think it would be better to start out with something other than chicken?
RickyWicky	Also, you have a hangover. 
RickyWicky	On that note, though, what are some good vegetarian dishes you like to make?
RickyWicky	Yes, this one I actually learned from watching Kitchen Nightmares! Definitely a good tip, thanks.
RickyWicky	I bought mine second hand, only to find out the rotary encoder knobs are faulty. When you turn, say, the oscillation knob to the right, the effect lessens. When you turn it left...it lessens. You have to push the knob real hard and then turn, then it works right. It's a bitch. I should actually sell it and get a smaller combo amp (like a Marshall MG30DFX) but I'm afraid I won't get much exactly because of the faulty knobs. When I bought it I was too eager to actually *have* it to inspect it properly.
RickyWicky	Damn, that's definitely worse. The amp I have is a Peavey Vypyr 75w, much cheaper than the 6505+ head. Do you intend to use it still or do you think it's worth it to sell?
RickyWicky	The first three Halo games come to mind.
RickyWicky	Chicken and pork, yeah.  Edit: my dad got really sick once because of raw pork...because he was stupid one too many times in tasting raw pork. How he thought that was a good idea is beyond me, but he learned his lesson.
RickyWicky	This has got to be an amazing fucking job.
RickyWicky	I once had a client who flirted with me like crazy. I was 21, she was about 60 and came to our print shop to print Phineas & Ferb posters for her granddaughter. However... she was showing so much saggy, leathery tanned old lady cleavage. Definitely a trashfest. 
RickyWicky	I ended up having 7 slices of pizza and 5 beers and potato chips. FML. I really don't want to do the accounting for this. 
RickyWicky	It would have been hilarious if your name was Maxine. The scale might instead want to tell you "Max...you weigh too little" and then you can be all like "No, fuck you" and feel extremely validated. 
RickyWicky	Tonight/this weekend, anxiety creeping in. | So I only started with restricting again in the last 4-5 days after a long and highly overdue hiatus from it. A week ago I made plans with a very good friend of mine to hang out Friday night, which is tonight, and there's usually lots of alcohol and pizza and whatnot involved. So now I'm paranoid, because since making the plans, my state of mind has changed drastically and I'd hate to cancel on her.  The alcohol is easy enough to avoid, I can just drink Diet Coke or soda water or something. But I'm struggling to figure out how to go about the food. I can probably just make up something and say that I ate tons throughout the day and am not hungry, but I think she'll know I'm lying because she knows my history. Or I'm paranoid.  Additionally, I made plans with my sister to go out this weekend, and there's usually cheesecake involved. Sweet delicious, devious, yucky, amazing cheesecake.  The weekends are always the worst.  **tl;dr:** does anyone else have the hardest time over the weekends because of friends and family? Or do you struggle more during the week?
RickyWicky	Yeah, I gotta say, the dishonesty hurts a lot for me, too. 
RickyWicky	Shit, I didn't even notice. I was lying in bed and the question occurred to me so I was typing it out on mobile in a hurry. My bad.
RickyWicky	Men of Reddit, what's the most demasculating thing that has ever happened to you? | 
RickyWicky	Binging. | [removed]
RickyWicky	Many years ago, one of the cats we had ended up behind my bed. As he was trying to jump back up, he stuck his nails into whatever was closest for grip, which was my heel. I couldn't sleep for a while because that fucking hurt like fuck. Also, he was fat and had to *pull* himself onto the bed.
RickyWicky	I can't decide if you're extremely sick or just extremely brave with nerves of steel, and can face literally anything like a goddamn (sick) superhero.  Thank you for your service...you sick motherfucker, you.
RickyWicky	Or you're about to die.
RickyWicky	Cabinet doors opening and closing in the kitchen.
RickyWicky	We became bester friends. No tongue, though.
RickyWicky	Redditors at work, besides being on Reddit, what else would you prefer to be doing? | 
RickyWicky	I love my sister, but goddamn this is her. She pisses me off so much...and yet I love her to bits. And now she's pregnant, so that's all she's talking about, over everyone. Loudly.
RickyWicky	For me, it's actually having some more work to do. I'm bored pretty regularly at work and it's driving me nuts.
RickyWicky	Redditors at work, besides being on Reddit, what would you rather be doing? | [removed]
RickyWicky	Regarding vehicle licensing and roadworthiness headaches and whatnot | [removed]
RickyWicky	I concur.
RickyWicky	If you're suicidal, I think one of the most important things you need to focus on is patience. It's hard, but worth it. Patience is a skill that not only will help you get past your suicidal thoughts, but generally make you a happier person. The more you can readily be satisfied by less is key to being happy with not always getting what you want, because life doesn't hand you everything you want.  With patience, you can work for what you want steadily. 
RickyWicky	Honestly, I'd do this too if I were in shape. I'm not gay, but I'd totally do this if it made some guys happy. I like making people happy.
RickyWicky	It gets harder as you get older, but the trick really is to "latch on" to the people that you do know. The best way to make friends is through the people that you know already. If you don't really know anyone, then you just kinda have to get out there, join an interest group of some variety or even start a conversation with a stranger, you'd be surprised. 
RickyWicky	Watching Pokemon, eating 2 minute ramen noodles. I'm in South Africa. After Pokemon, my friend and I flipped through the channels and caught the events happening live on CNN. 
RickyWicky	Kinda, yeah. I don't want to be immortal, I like having a ticking clock, slowly inching towards my grave...at any second. I mean, I could have a reddit related accident right now and bam, my life is over. 
RickyWicky	If you're immortal then it stands to reason that you'll eventually do everything so I would..just... wait.
RickyWicky	This is a pretty long list of stuff when you look at it. Create yourself a bulleted list, and start at the top and work your way down, ~~crossing each one out~~ as you do it!
RickyWicky	This is generally why I don't get into confrontations ever. I say sorry when I need to, when I was in the wrong or offended someone I care about. Anger is not a useful interpersonal emotion. 
RickyWicky	You know, reddit is a great platform to start from, I think. I'm sure a lot of people here (me included, I LOVE standup) will be willing to watch a video of you doing your material and give you constructive criticism, which is honestly one of the best things that anyone can ever give you. 
RickyWicky	Just Shia LeBeouf it.  I did it. Got rejected, BUT, I learned a lot. In the time that passed since asking her out, I learned that she really thinks too much of herself, and I don't even mean that as a mean thing. She's still a sweet, beautiful girl and a dear friend of mine. However, she has this idea that she's going to marry a rich man, live on a huge farm and be happy forever. So she's very stuck on her ideals.  Also, in the time leading up to me asking her out, I made a bunch of mistakes that counted against me. I came across as desperate, and I was friendzoned all because of my own actions. The only way I could have known this is by being rejected, so I'm happy it happened and know now to not make those same mistakes in the future.  So worst case scenario, you get rejected. It's really not such a bad thing, because what you learn in retrospect is far more valuable than what you don't learn by not taking any action. Also, if this person says yes, then that's an obvious plus too. 
RickyWicky	I *knew* playing Doom would come in handy!
RickyWicky	I love how nuanced female orgasms can be. I feel like a lot of the times guys act dumb about it, but it's so not a science. All girls differ, naturally, but this has to be tip number 1 when you're pleasing your lady friend: keep doing what her body is responding to. She'll tell you when to switch things up.   Edit: a word.
RickyWicky	Thanks for this. I'm generally not a fan of the "no combat" games. To me it just doesn't seem logical to have NO means of defending yourself in any way. I might be looking at it from a spoiled point of view. Maybe I'll just wait until Outlast is on a Steam sale and give it a shot, can always refund if I don't like it.  Also, Fatal Frame. I've heard nothing bad about those games! So I guess I'll go there next.  What about Dead Space 2? Any good?   I should mention I really don't like jump scares and Doom 3 is pretty rife with just that, as was Dead Space 1. I got over it, but I feel it's cheap horror, you know? I really liked Silent Hill 2 for just being creepy as all holy hell, which is what I'm really after.  The Evil Within: Psychological horror or jump scares?
RickyWicky	♪ And I would do anything for $200,000,000, but I won't do *that*♪
RickyWicky	Rite of Passage: horror games! | I've never been a big fan of the horror game genre. I've played and loved games like Resident Evil (1 & 3) and was deeply in love with Silent Hill 2. And lately I've been trying to get into horror games a bit more, so I'm playing Doom 3. Also, I played Dead Space, which was scary as shit.  But which horror games, in your opinion, would be a rite of passage for someone trying to get into the genre?
RickyWicky	When I'm lucky I can pick mine up and she'll snuggle up in my hands, hide her face and be happy, but it's rare.
RickyWicky	What REALLY tests your fucking patience? | 
RickyWicky	Also, people who indicate their turn AS they fucking turn. 
RickyWicky	Yeah. This inconsideration applies to so many things, too. Like closing a door behind you when you enter and then leave a room where the door was closed in the first place. 
RickyWicky	Yeah, I get this. I used to really enjoy their videos, but I've become a bit jaded towards the "top 10 this" and "top 10 that" videos and lists. It's extremely lazy content repurposing. There's no creativity involved and no discussion being developed.
RickyWicky	Old man: "Gods be good, it's about focking time!"
RickyWicky	Does he make stupid excuses?
RickyWicky	To the point of them missing out on crucial plot points because of their talking, and then wondering WTF is going on a few minutes later. Had they only kept their fat fucking mouths shut.
RickyWicky	This. And then after fantasising about punching every-fucking-one in the genitals, you have to stand in line at the tills.
RickyWicky	Gum underneath the fucking table.    Also, when everyone's food doesn't come at the same time, so some people either have to eat before others and feel rude, or sit and wait while their food gets cold while waiting for the rest of the dishes to arrive. 
RickyWicky	I appreciate you taking the time to respond, regardless! I've never felt the *need* to go over to a mech, so I'll guess I'll just stick to regulated.
RickyWicky	I gotta ask: why go mech?   I'm just curious as I am so used to regulated mods, have never used a mechanical. What is the benefit?
RickyWicky	Guess I'm asocial then. 
RickyWicky	A lot of the times our work is done for us by other people. The company I work for does retail merchandising and all things related. So as our "proof of execution" to the vendor, we need to provide before and after photo's when the merchandising is done. Most retailers do this themselves, so we have to mess everything up in the before photo and then pack it right again in the "after" photo.
RickyWicky	Hey, at least now the people you don't need in your life will get filtered out, because those who like you should understand your faux pas. 
RickyWicky	I mean, it doesn't hurt.  Did the same thing with a female friend *I was willing to lose*, had she said no. She said yes. Many fun times were had, and I'm forever grateful to her because she was also my first. Also, still great friends.
RickyWicky	I had a friend who liked to boast about his intelligence, and he'd get stupidly defensive when I corrected him for exactly the intents/intensive mistake. 
RickyWicky	What, like "thanks for the food, yum, k let's bang?" I mean, that escalated quickly?
RickyWicky	Or Chuck Norris. 
RickyWicky	To, two, too, who's, whose, farther, further, Elijah Wood, Daniel Radcliffe.
RickyWicky	I'm not shy at all, and it takes a lot to make me blush. Also, part of my job is to regularly speak in front of large groups of people (I do retail sales training). However, I hate people, and prefer to be alone. So I'm a pretty big advocate for this distinction, too.
RickyWicky	Going into my late 20's, I get fewer questions about it. I've got scars on my forearms and upper arms, the latter of which sometimes are visible if I wear T-shirts. Honestly, the last time anyone has asked me about it was probably like 5 years ago at my previous job. But even then it was only customers who'd ask, my colleagues never mentioned it. At the new job, same story. No mention, I also never catch anyone staring, so I just assume that people don't feel the need ask about that sort of thing anymore. 
RickyWicky	I had a few:  Midnight Sting (11 times), Ready to Rumble (26 times) and Small Soldiers (lost count.)  Edit: changed a word.
RickyWicky	An epic stealthy stealthoff of stealthly proportions:  Solid Snake vs. Sam Fisher.  In a big insurgent military complex, FULL of soldiers who will shoot either of them on site. No alarms, no alerts.  
RickyWicky	Dekadus. I was 13, really whiney and emo and all the things associated with being an angsty teenager wanting to start a metal band.  
RickyWicky	When my parents would fight. Especially one time when my dad was threatening, with a gun to his head, to kill himself and shot at the wall unit in our house instead.   90% of the drama in our family is (still) due to him. I want to love my dad, but he's a cheating, lying drunk in denial.
RickyWicky	You're one good looking dude, gotta say. I feel insecure about myself now. Thanks, jerk.
RickyWicky	When lending money to someone, part with it without the expectation of actually getting it back. 
RickyWicky	I got to work this morning, opened my laptop, saw I still had chrome open, so I opened it and then there were boobs. Luckily everyone else was on the opposite side of the screen.   Edit: some words.
RickyWicky	Jude Law and Ewan McGregor. I tend to swap the names with the faces.
RickyWicky	Something sorta similar happened to me on more than one occasion. Back in the early 2000's we only had one computer in the house, and I wasn't so clued up on secrecy. A long distance girlfriend I had at the time sent me nudes of herself and I promptly dumped them in a folder that I thought was well hidden. My dad found them. He laughed and I felt so dense I could have become a black hole.  On another occasion when I was going through a crisis of sexuality, I had a bunch of gay hentai stuff saved on that very same computer that my dad also found. He laughed a little less at this and I got a very different response.  I've, uh, become a lot better at hiding my porn since. 
RickyWicky	That's almost what's going on. I have it hidden as such: External>music>my music>OST>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion>0The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion>New Folder>New Folder>New Folder>Bam.
RickyWicky	I think it would be better if they straight up put subtitles into scenes like that.
RickyWicky	Cycling for the win, definitely.
RickyWicky	I think about this a lot, too. A very good friend I used to have, who has since gone his own way, used to not focus on the big picture: being happy. Instead, he's nearly 40, wants very hard to look like Chris Pratt, wants very hard to be Zuckerberg levels of rich, wants very hard to have his super cars, but isn't putting any work into actually accomplishing any of it and constantly complains that things are bad.  These aren't just fantastical ideals, these are actual goals for him. Just, minus effort because "things don't ever go my way."  And I was in that state of mind with him for a long time. We were going to develop this killer mobile app (which I still want to do, simply because an app like this *still* doesn't exist, and I have the skill to do it, he doesn't) but I came to realise that becoming a humbler person, saying your sorry's and your thank you's, and generally expecting LESS from life is the key to being a happier person. If the money rolls in, cool. I've got big plans for that money. If they money doesn't roll in, I'm not losing much, because I am happy with what I have. 
RickyWicky	Same. I still play from time to time, also. I have 5 guitars: 1 x Strat, 1 x Ibanez, 1 x cheap bass, 1 x cheap classical and 1 x steel string acoustic. I've "technically" been playing for 16 years, but I hit my ceiling a decade ago and just haven't been able to get better.  My main issue is stage fright. I got tired of entertaining myself and wanted to play for others, but whenever I try, I suck at it. I focus *too hard* on being as good as I am when I'm alone, but that never works. So... now they're all gathering dust.  Edit: spelling. Also, I have a 75w Peavey amp that I've never actually used to even 1/20th of its full potential. 
RickyWicky	She looks really huggable.
RickyWicky	Well, it's either nothing or something. It's not yet possible for us to know exactly what preceded the big bang, but some theories do prevail that are a lot more plausible than "nothing".  It's exactly that concept of nothing that makes people plug religion into that near literal black hole. So, God/Allah/Chuck Norris preceded the big bang, there was something else, there is still something else and our universe is just coincidentally inside of that something, or there was nothing.   Nothing makes the least sense, which is also why it hurts so bad to think about it. We are coincidental chemical and biological accidents in a universe filled with *something*, thus we cannot come to sufficient grips with the concept of *nothing*. 
RickyWicky	I like the idea of the dynamacy behind a universe that is always existing in some state or another. Perhaps the universe existed, right? Then after billions and billions of years, it fell into itself due to its own gravity and formed a singularity. After billions more years, that singularity radiated enough energy away to no longer be infinitely dense, so all the matter inside it was expulsed, which is what we call the big bang and how the current state of the universe as we have observed it came into being.  I'm not saying it's right, and I won't argue that it's right, because I don't know. But that's the theory I like to entertain. It's really open to anyone's theory, however, I still don't think there was ever nothing. There has always been something.
RickyWicky	No, my point was that nothing is the least plausible answer, and that there is/was something, or it was actioned by a higher power. I personally don't think the latter is the case because the higher power theory only makes sense in a world in which we truly are important figures in the universe to have actually come to know of this higher power in the first place.
RickyWicky	Rap. Purely because there is so much, so if I was able to enjoy rap, I'd never have a shortage. But I just can't put it on and enjoy it.
RickyWicky	Someone knocks on the door, door is answered immediately.
RickyWicky	Contra, circa 1994 when I was 3 years old. I've been gaming since I've been able to understand video games.
RickyWicky	Completed CoD 4: Modern Warfare on Veteran.  Perhaps mild in comparison to some the stuff here, but that stands out to me, as I haven't enjoyed a CoD game since then.
RickyWicky	My mom, when she found out my dad was cheating on her (the first time.) She doesn't know about the second time, which is taking place now, and I don't know how to go about that, tbh. The first time was bad enough. 
RickyWicky	I'll never look at a hallway filled with doors the same way again because of Silent Hill 2. ( ‾ʖ̫‾)
RickyWicky	Tell me about it. I also really enjoyed the first three Silent Hill games. No jump scares! Just some seriously psychologically scarring shit that stays will you for days and changes you as a person  Much better. 
RickyWicky	I really don't enjoy games with jump scares. It completely destroys the fun for me. I know in recent years the whole "helpless hero" thing has become popularised by games like Amnesia, Outlast etc., but I don't want to just run and hide. I want to kick ass. Chewing gum optional.
RickyWicky	My sister had this issue with Skyrim. She was close to finishing the main quest and then one of the quest stages wouldn't trigger and so she couldn't complete it. And this was in PS3, so it's not like you can even manually fix it with the construction set. Shit like that ticks me off to no end. 
RickyWicky	I apply this rule in any game that allows me to save whenever I want. I often save multiple times when I can't remember if I actually saved or not. 
trunksfreak	I want to remind you of something. While beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, beauty fades with time. What would you prefer, someone who is below average and has a possibility of becoming more attractive over time or someone who is stunning and only has one way to go? To be honest not everyone who is drop dead gorgeous has the best personality. Do you want someone who is looks amazing but literally pisses you off at every turn with their personality?
trunksfreak	You remember the kid that used to have a ton of acne and braces tuning into this stunning guy, and the attractive girl in the cheer leading squad turn toothless junky.
trunksfreak	This right here is incredibly powerful haha
trunksfreak	Faster than light travel. Or the definitive discovery of wormholes
trunksfreak	I relate to this soooo hard
trunksfreak	Ahahaha. This is the sorriest excuse for a scam. If not I'm sorry but this is hilariously desperate.
trunksfreak	Remember when blacks had a segregated area for bathrooms and water fountains? Yeeeeah.....
trunksfreak	I'm tired of waking up. Period. | I'm tried of feeling like I'm retarded. I can't concentrate or really hold onto anything anybody tells me anymore. My memory is shit. People hate being around me when I need them to because I ooze negative aura and bad energy. I'm tired of looking for love. I have put myself out there so many times that I barely have a heart left to give anyone. I tried to give someone everything that I was and all she did was shit all over me and lie, lie , LIE! I hate myself. Every fucking day. I put on this fake smile just so I don't scare people off anymore. All I want is for someone to come up to me and hug me. And not let go. Just cry with me make me feel like I'm not this worthless piece of shit that I think I am. I'm almost 27 and I'm so far behind in life its not even funny. I've started noticing I'm getting even pickier and more judgmental than I used to be. I'm a fat ugly slob who is going bald because I can't stop messing with my hair. I live in filth and no matter how hard I've tried to look positively about my situation, as well as fix it, it just keeps going back to shit. I can't cry anymore. Like really cry. The only times when I can be truly emotional are when I'm on LSD. My best friend said he'd never seen me cry the way I did on my last trip. I just can't seem to weep anymore. To get out those negative emotions. I start and then its like a switch. It goes away. I have good moments but I'm so fucking alone. I just want to be touched. I can't find anyone because I can't handle rejection anymore. And the rejection comes every single time. I'm not kind. I fake it. I know I used to be loving and kind because I was naïve to how the world truly worked. All the true pieces of shit get somewhere in life and the people that really care get left in the gutter. I don't want to be cruel and miserable. I want to be loving and kind. I need to be. I'm just so tired of getting up everyday to the same old struggle. I'm so tired. And I'm weak. And I feel like a fool for even continuing to go on. The only thing holding me back is the lack of motivation and fear of pain it will not only cause me but everyone else.
trunksfreak	Let me say this, in some aspects, psychedelics can help. I don't know about microdosing but if you were to try them start with acid. Maybe 150 ug on your first trip. It'll be like dipping your toes into Lucy's world. Some visuals and not so rapid but circling and evolving thoughts. I've done 300 to 400 one time and I thought I died and went to hell. Be careful. The mind is a fragile instrument. Treat him carefully. Its like learning to swim. You don't throw yourself into a pool that's 20 ft deep when you've never been outside of a shower before. Small steps. Be in a good place. Mentally and physically. Be with someone you know you can trust. That you love and who loves you back even of its just a friend. Have a plan in mind. Take some time to meditate and mentally prepare yourself for the experience. I've heard microdosing can be beneficial in many ways. I've never tried it but its worth a shot. I'd say start with 25 ug of LSD first. 50 would be too much and you wouldn't be able to focus.
trunksfreak	This hits hone for me. I'm a bigger guy and I've got an odd looking body as a result. I met this girl and we fell in love. She was bigger than me but it honestly didnt phase me. I loved her. She was my first time and I wanted to make her my last. Long story short, she left me. She kept me in contact because she knew I cared for her and was using me for emotional support. She starts dating this good looking skinny guy that's more than twice her age, considering he was stalking her at work. He was a drug addict and dealer. She bales him out and the whole 9 yards. Well karmas gets us all in the end because this guy she got rapped up with used her to help him steal nearly $10,000 from MY store. She still won't give him up to the police. Both of them are going to prison. And after crying and pining for this bitch for as long as I have, I now couldn't care less what happens. She did this to herself. She was the most beautiful woman when I met her but now she's easily the most disgusting person I've ever met.

trunksfreak	I think all of you need to understand that friends keep each other in check sometimes. If you see your best friend trying to hurt themselves, do you just sit there and let it happen because its none of your business or do you say something because you FUCKING CARE? It is totally your business because she involved you in it. It wouldn't be your business if she said nothing, but she did, and if you truly care about her then I don't think its wrong of you to speak up. This idea of always letting people do as they please even when its causing other people pain is bullshit. Friends don't let friends drive drunk. That goes for a lot of other things yo.
trunksfreak	What if your SO's friend knew that your SO was cheating on you and didn't say anything. Take that into consideration.
trunksfreak	There are times in your life that are absolute hell. There is no denying that. These times may seem like an eternity while you are experiencing them, but it does get better. There are also times when you feel as though you've already died and gone to heaven, but its those bad times that allow you to truly appreciate these times of peace, joy, and contentment. Life is both heaven and hell on death, and its what you make of any experience that determines your state of mind. In the wise words of Dory, "Keep on swimming, keep on swimming."
trunksfreak	Afternova - Serenity (Andy Blueman Remix)
trunksfreak	Clingy guys are definitely around but they are hard to find because today's society has deemed that quality to be negative. So in many cases, these guys will act not clingy because its been shown to them that they aren't worth peoples time. I myself am clingy. If I'm emotionally invested in someone, I want to spend as much time as I can with them. But unfortunately I can't allow that side of myself to come out anymore for fear of losing them in the process.
trunksfreak	Or maybe they worked in a gas station
trunksfreak	Dropping 150 1P-LSD today. | [removed]
trunksfreak	I suggest anything by Carbon Based Lifeforms
trunksfreak	Seeing quantum frames. | I just want to theorize for a minute. Is it possible that acid allows you to see quantum frames more easily? Almost like you experience time slowed down to fewer and fewer frames the more you take. That's why sometimes it feels like an eternity. What do you guys think is happening when we experience reality on acid? Give me your theories, I'd love to hear them.
trunksfreak	I highly recommend anything by Daniel Kandi. Easily one of my favorites is Child. Most of his remixes are stunningly gorgeous. The guy knows how to put emotion in his music.
trunksfreak	I live in northern Indiana and I have lived here my whole life. And thanks in part to acid I find my state to be unbelievably gorgeous
trunksfreak	As a guy who is a dork most of the time, please be a dork. I can't tell you how many people think its a bad thing. But seriously own that shit. Dorkiness is fantastic
trunksfreak	Can you help me identify this mushroom | I just want to make sure if this is safe to eat or not, or if they are psychedelic or not.[caption](http://imgur.com/vvlh9M0.jpg)
trunksfreak	Man somehow that quote hit me really fucking hard
trunksfreak	I don't care what others think, Jar Jar is an amzing character. | [removed]
trunksfreak	Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.
trunksfreak	The Oblivion soundtrack is so fucking good.
trunksfreak	One thing ive learned is that if you put looks as one of your main defining factors in finding someone, then you are going to find a lot of superficial people who focus mostly on being attractive and put their character aside. Those who focus on improving their character and less on looks (which in todays society, is somewhat looked down upon) these are the people who are worth your time. But they are more or less invisible because beauty catches the eye. But beauty only lasts for so long. Then it begins to fade. Yet character, character stays with you for life. Thats why ive always said that character always trumps looks. You can have a gorgeous girl, but if her personality is shit, well, then you're gonna have a bad time. You can polish a turd, but its still a turd.
trunksfreak	Why is it so hard for me to be just friends with women? | Every time i try and be just friends with women i end up falling for them. Im tired of my emotions getting in the way of potential friendships. It also makes finding a girlfriend impossible. Im desirable when i have no feelings, but when i do its like they want nothing to do with me. I guess i just need to not really care about it anymore. I need to completely avoid my feelings altogether.
trunksfreak	Thank you for the advice man. I feel as though being open hearted is what gets me hurt so much. And the fact that i cant seem to quell my anxiety. Whenever i have feelings for someone my mind will automatically start telling me that they dont feel the same and that they are just lying to me. Im trying desperately to get over this aspect of myself
trunksfreak	Dont do it. Your buddy wont take it well.
trunksfreak	I have to be completely honest with you. I dont believe you actually love this girl. Love is much more than an emotion. Its a commitment and an action. Breaking up with her after such a trying time in her life is showing her that your love is superficial. I dont mean to sound like a dick, im just being completely honest. If you say you love this girl then show her by being there and supporting her through this rough patch. And when you go through a difficult time in your life, and trust me you definitely will, she may be all that more willing to be there for you in your time of need. You are going to experience the worst in your significant other. And she is going to experience the worst in you. One of the biggest problems with the world nowadays is that we bolt whenever things get hard. Relationships are not easy. They take hard work and dedication. And while sometimes, yes, you need to take care of yourself, a relationship is much bigger than you. Its two people now, not you and her. Its "us".
trunksfreak	Looks of indignation. | [caption](http://imgur.com/fZf4cDN.jpg)I've noticed a lot times when i l lock eyes with a woman, i get this look of disgust. It doesn't really bother me, but it begs the question, what's is wrong with the way i look to cause women to give me that look? I can upload a picture if nessesary.
trunksfreak	Few people really try though. Even though I'm told things like that. I've always considered myself a worthwhile guy but my anxiety gets in the way of my confidence.
trunksfreak	This is about the only way i smoke. I love my blunts and joints but if you're like me and make under 20k a year then a bowl is the best way. In fact if you really want to be fancy, get a wooden pipe with a cap on the bowl. It looks fucking sweet and puts out your bowl without you having to hold it
trunksfreak	Lol i absolutely was.
trunksfreak	The most traumatizing experience of my life. | I will try to best describe everything as best i can. This experience took place on my birthday last year and its taken me an incredibly long time to process it. First a little backstory on myself before i get into my trip.   When i was around 5 1/2 my father passed away due to a heart attack. I watched him fall over dead on the bed like it was yesterday. Many pediatricians and counselors said that i wouldnt really understand what happened until i was much older. It may not have directly affected me throughout my life but it has been an unconscious burden ever since.   I woke up the day before my birthday and decided to use the gift my best friend gave me for my birthday. Three hits of acid. We didnt really know the potency of it but knew it was the real thing. I pop all three and wait for the fireworks to start as they usually do. Now ive tripped a total of 3 times. The first i did 4 hits gradually over a period of 3 hours. The second i did one hit with a buddy and then this trip. So i had a little experience going into this. What i did experience i was not in the least prepared for. Ive previously forgot to mention that i went through a bad break up that year and i was struggling with terrible depression.   Hour 1-2: The visuals start coming on incredibly strong. Certain points, like specks on the wall, began to have this swirling peacock feather type of fractals. They were absolutely everywhere. Moreso than any of my other trips. My mind started to do its usual spiraling into a type of insanity, as i like to call it. Thought loops and a complete inability to hold conversation and concentrate. My family were all doing things (they knew what i was doing. And have been very open minded to me experimenting with psychedelics. I love you guys) my sister thought it would be a great idea for me to go on a nature walk at an old childhood friend's house. She had taken acid there years before.  Hours 3-6: The ride over to my friend's house was absolutely beautiful. This was during the fall and it was a very bright and beautiful day with the different colors of leaves on the trees. They lived out in the country so it was like i was going down a winding endless road of autumn beauty. The fractals were mixing so wonderfully with the trees and the green grass. We arrive at the house after what seemed like hours but i knew only took about 13 min. I get out of the car and look at the front door and it has a lot if halloween decorations on it with a zombie warning and keep out sign. In my state of mind it was setting up a slight bit of anxiety and i was a little nervous. Now my sister tells me that our friend has a bunch of dogs and that i need to be calm and slow because the lot of them had been abused. What i walked into was absolutley delightful as i sat in the chair closest to the front doo. I was surrounded but these beautiful yet terrifying creatures jumping and licking all over me. I felt like a child again with all these sweet pups showing me so much affection. As things finally calmed down we settled down to smoking the big joint i rolled earlier that day. As i took my first drag things started to change a little. I was looking around the room and take every single detail in, things started to become very familiar to me. I turned to my sister and i look her straight in the eyes and ask her "is this the house dad died in?" i started to weep uncontrollably as memories i thought id lost started to flood back into my conscious mind. It wasnt the house he died in but i believe it was the house my mom took me to the day he died so she could go with him to the hospital. Ive read somewhere that a brain under the influence of LSD makes connections to other parts of the brain that it normally doesnt connect with. So all of the old memories that i had pushed out of my head when i was younger were coming back in such vivid detail. All of the emotions, smells, physical feelings, and thoughts from that day were flooding back to me. It was too much for me to handle. So much so i believe i began to lose touch with reality.   I dont know what happened exactly but reality started to shift and settle into a separate reality. Visually everything was the same buts as if all of the peacock feather fractals i was seeing were slowing their twirl and stopped into these dimondesque new fractals. It was as time itself completely stopped. I look around and i felt as though i traveled back in time. My sister and her friend were wearing some psychedelic biker clothing and badanas. My sister was no longer there. I dont know who it was but she became inhabited by a being. For a minute i thought she was my wife from another universe. The being said no. Yet i felt all these overwhelming emotions of love for this person. Its like i was looking at another man's witmfe through his eyes. Then it occurred to me that i was looking at my mother from nearly 30 years ago through my father's eyes. Then this being became horribly sinister. It was somehow communicating with me telepathically. Finishing my thoughts for me and showing me that the world i was in now was hell itself. She told me that i was a sinner and that my sins could not be forgiven. But before i stepped of into hell she would show me some revelations of the universe. Bear with me for what im about to say, this was the beginning of a slight psychotic break i was having. She told me that there is no meaning to the universe. That we are simply a simulation created by a program desingned to run a rotating marlboro advertisement at the center of the universe placed there by the creators of cigaettes as a final cosmic joke. And we are its power source. Its very confusing i know but this is what i saw. I get the being that was speaking to me was very passive agressive. Almost horrifically so. As if everything i said was not worth a damn. Then we get up and start to walk out the door. And i turn around and ask this being if im dying and this is what we see when we die. The being telepathically said yes my sister said no. I had the revelation that i was reliving my fathers death from his perspective. He saw his beautiful wife before he passed on and saw all of the regets in life before moving on. I walked out feeling defeated and understanding that i had no control over what was happening and that i purely had to accept it. I dont remember much of what happened next but i do remember trying to start my nature walk. I got caught in some burr plants and ended up ruining the pants i was wearing. So we decided to go home. I get in the car and lay back and i can see everything begin to go dark. All the while in my mind this picture of a rotating marlboro advertisement was the very center and only point of my thinking. Then as everything when black i could hear my heart beating fast and begin to slow until there was nothing left. There was no sound or feeking or anything. Except for the singular thought of thar advertisement. I dont really remember coming out of it but the next thing i remember is us pulling up to my house. I was slightly hysterical. I remember asking my mom for a cigarette desperately. Like my life depended on it. It was odd for them because i dont smoke and have always hated the fact that they did. After the first drag i lost the ability to hold myself up and i collapsed. I dont know why i did but it frightened me.   Hours 7-36: Yes this trip lasted 36 hours. A lot happened but i wont go into much detail. My ex calls me while im still peaking. And almost unconsciously i pick up the phone but cant form any coherent words to speak so i hand the phone to my family. They describe to her that im not really able to concentrate pong enough to simply put on a new pair of pants. I dont know what happened the next however many hours but i know i called her back after my mind had cleared up a little. I still had slightly strong visuals but no muddled mind. I called her and apologized for the state i was in the previous day and told her i really wanted to see her. I didnt tell her but i was desperately looking for some kind of love, comfort and support from anyone. My family didnt really care how i was feeling and my best friend was elsewhere busy. She told me to meet her someplace and i agreed and set off. On my way and about 15 min till i got there she called me telling me to turn back. I was floored and deeply hurt. I told her i was almost there and so she told me to meet her at a different place. I waited for her for about 20 min. She finally showed up. She didnt want me to get in her car so i waited abother 10 min till she got out and got in mine. The entire time she was on the phone with a jail to wire her, now i know, new boyfriend money. She wouldnt look me in the face. She wouldnt talk to me and she wouldnt touch me. She gets out of the car and gets back in hers after telling me that she needs to go to the jail. She tells me to wait. I waited for 45 min. The whole time im thinking about how much of a piece of shit i am and how worthless i was to her. I refused to beleive it but she used me our entire relationship while giving very little to nothing in return. Ill admit that i wasnt perfect and many times i lashed out but never physically. She camr back and i knew i meant absolutely nothing to her. I head on my way home and the visuals end at around hour 36. This final bit with my ex happened on my birthday.   tl;dr It was the single most profound experience of my life. And it has left me very humbled but weak. I don't know if ill ever be the same again. All the things i experienced had some sort of deep meaning for me. Be careful when you delve deep in to psychedelics. You may turn up something that will haunt you for the rest of your life.
trunksfreak	I didnt sleep the entire time
trunksfreak	Thank you for your kind words.
trunksfreak	More or less the visuals lasted for 36 hours. But im positive it was lsd. My buddy took from the same batch and had a comoletely different exoerience than i did. Plus his only lasted 12 hours.
trunksfreak	Im too open about myself and it pushes people away. | All i want is love. But everytime i seem to get it, its ripped away from me. My friend and my family all tell me that people really like me, but i dont see why. I hate myself. I think i have for my entire life. Every relationship i have ends within a few months. It brings me down so low that i feel love is pointless. I want to get all this poison in me out but everytime i do, more just takes its place. When i talk to people its always short conversations. Ive realized that its almost impossible for me to have long conversations with people. When i talk to women that i find attractive i stumble and then fall silent. I ask myself what is the point to all of this. Whats the point in living a meaningless existence? I dont feel love. I dont know what it is. I just want to waste away and live alone because i know that im not worth the love. Im not worth anything.
trunksfreak	Thank you for your kindness. Life has been a rollercoaster for me lately. As soon as i confronted her about this guy, she blocked me on facebook. I deleted and block her number and ive thrown away everything shes given me. She was absolutley heartless and its such a relief to know her true character. I can almost guarantee she will come back sooner or later but this time, i wont be there. She abandoned me when i needed her most so hwy should i extend the same kindness anymore.
trunksfreak	First of all im sure that you are stunning 😁. And i mean that with all the kindness i can give. Fuck him for bailing on you. Gives us guys a bad name. Even if he had nerves and anxiety he at least could have come out with it. I hope for better times coming your way.
trunksfreak	So you would rather use these guys for their affection and money and, potentially, love and give absolutely nothing back. Thats cruel
trunksfreak	From your replies in many other advice threads, you truly dont seem happy but angry. I mean no disrespect.
trunksfreak	I dont claim to know what you have been through. I only know what i have experienced. And that hasnt been much. I dont know if im being naive for hoping there is someone who appreciates me for me. I guess i just need to sift through people who aren't worth my time. Im not going to let that dim my spirits. I honestly hope you find someone who changes your outlook on men.
trunksfreak	Well by societal standards no i dont see myself as incredibly attractive but i try to find better qualities about myself that make me worthwhile. She is beautiful. Just plain and simple. A lot of people had thought less of her because she was a big girl but i thought differently. I saw more than just her beauty. I saw deeper into her. Can we take this to pm's? There might be some things i dont want to share with everyone that i tell you.
trunksfreak	I did commit to her. I really did. But everytime i showed that to her she would back away which in turn told me that i had to back away. And then she would come running back to me. It wasnt so much that i didnt commit to her as it was all the times she treated like i didnt matter. There was this one time where she said she was coming over after work. She got there and sat in the driveway talking to one of her ex boyfriends for over an hour. This was while we were in a steady relationship. I was fully committed to her she only wanted my attention. And thats almost all i get anymore. Women wanting my attention and never interested in giving anything back. So many times she showed me that i was worthless to her. But i let her keep doing it because love makes you do stupid things. It was completely the other way around. She was the one not committing to me. I told her multiple times that if she truly wanted me, then i was totally there. I was just never good enough for her and i couldnt put up with the constant blowing me off and lies. I was the one waiting. Its all i ever did in that relationship. All the lies she told me. I would have taken all of it just to be able to spend time in her presence. But she would constantly keep me at arms length. Yes she was the first to tell me she loved me. But added on the line "but this is how i break up with people" completely taking away the meaningfulness of what she said. I meant nothing to her and that what hurts so much is because i put in so much of my heart into her.
trunksfreak	Thats why i just simply cant, in my good conscience, do that to someone else purely because ive had it happen to me.
trunksfreak	I guess im just angry myself. I tried so hard to trust this girl that told me she loved me. It gave me this false sense of hope that something would continue between us. I mean i even spoke to her about it and many times she would just keep on with that hope that we would be together all the while seeing someone twice her age and who seems to be very abusive. It just hurts when you put a piece of yourself into someone to see them turn around and throw it away like a piece of garbage.
trunksfreak	No, thats not it. I understand in a way why you think the way you do. I come from a different walk of life and see the world from a differing perspective from yours. I admit its difficult for me to accept other peoples reasons for doing what they do. You just seem cold to life.
trunksfreak	Thank you for this
trunksfreak	Can i ask why this has been your best course of action. You can pm me so its not out in the open.
trunksfreak	How can you best move on from serious heartbreak? | I just found out today this girl that ive been off and on with since 2016 is seeing someone else and has been lying to me this entire time. Including during my relationship. Im heartbroken and i cant take it anymore with the lies people tell me to spare my feelings. Why is it so hard to find respectful abd loving partners? I dont know if i can trust anyobe ever again. I feel like everyone is always hiding how they really feel from me.
trunksfreak	Why do people so many times default to cheating? | This a mild rant so bear with me. I just heard that a buddy of mine is getting a divorce because his wife cheated on him. Cheating is easily one of the most despicable things you can do to your significant other. What the hell brings someone to do such a thing? It pisses me off to no end! My two cents is that if you've cheated on someone, regardless of the situation, you aren't any better than the worst of humanity. Instead of ending the relationship like a responsible and mature adult, just fuck another person to show how utterly worthless you think your SO is. How in gods name can you expect someone who had 9 years with this person to ever be able to trust another soul again.
trunksfreak	This is a really good depiction of what going through a spiraling tunel of terror on is like on LSD.
trunksfreak	I wholeheartedly disagree. But it really doesn't matter because i was involving both sexes. I see where you come from but disagree.
trunksfreak	By all means yo
trunksfreak	As depressing as your statement is, i feel its very true.
trunksfreak	Lol im a 26 y/o straight man
trunksfreak	Or when your girlfriend says she is going to come over and sits in the driveway talking to her ex boyfriend for and hour before coming in.
trunksfreak	Why is it so hard to find those who want a meaningful relationship? | I just feel like nowadays most people only want hookups or cuddlebuddies. Few people actually want to put in the blood, sweat and tears that comes with a real relationship. I personally can't deal with hookups as i usually can't separate my feelings from sex. I feel lost. Like there's that special someone right in front of me but we're both blind to it because of what society dictates is the only way to live. *Edit: Im amazed at the quality of the responses I've gotten. Thank you for all of you're insight! **Edit: I am a 26 y/o straight male
trunksfreak	Because the casual nature of dating nowadays is whats ruining love for this society. With dating we are usually only willing to share the most superficial side of ourselves. I understand that love doesn't happen immediately but most of society has this thing with instant gratification. Find someone and see that they make you feel all cozy inside but then some things go south a little (as is the nature of our lives) then they're like "oh i dont feel those warm and cozy feelings anymore" so drop them and find someone new. The nature of dating. Move on 5o the next best thing in our pointless search for the perfect person for us. There is no perfect person. Only damaged people in need of love in the form of friendship and companionship. We are all damaged in our own ways.
trunksfreak	Nope im a man
trunksfreak	I unfortunately agree with you. Society expects too much out of everyone. We're expected to get a well paying job, work 40 or more hours a week, have hobbies so that you're found to be interesting, be there for your family whenever they need you, own a car, a home/apartment, and have a stable relationship. Life demands too much out of everyone. Especially those from the millennial generation. The only things that i have ever wanted, not necessarily even a family, was a woman whome i could spend the rest of my life with, and to be apart of nature. We are all so disconnected from one another that we live meaningless lives. The only thing that gives meaning ti my life anymore is when i see that I've put a smile on someones face. To see that i was the cause of someones happiness. But anymore, even though we can connect with anyone around the world within seconds, we are all so disconnected from what really matters. We all only ever pay attention to ourselves and our own selfish needs. Empathy and selflessness are thibgs of the past. But somehow, with all the hate and sadness that ive experienced in my life, i still hold onto this hope that maybe someone will see me for who i am and want to spend their life with me.
trunksfreak	Yes see im the kind of guy that looks dont matter to me as much as most men. I want someone with a quality character. Ill take the pain, suffering, anxiety, imperfections, insecurities, and general awkwardness that comes with getting to know someone. Its about pushing through all the walls and giving the other person an honest-to-god chance. I just want someone to give me the benefit of the doubt. I know i am willing to do so.
trunksfreak	I like the way you word things. This is a solid answer thank you for your worthwhile input!
trunksfreak	Lol pm me sometime if you'd like to find out
trunksfreak	I previously mentioned that im 26
trunksfreak	Then pm yo lol
trunksfreak	This is sad but true for a majority of people.
trunksfreak	Yeah i get you there. I personally dont live near many big cities so meeting a lot of people is a bit hard when you live in small towns.
trunksfreak	I previously mentioned that im 26
trunksfreak	Im 26
trunksfreak	Is it looked down upon by women for men to come to them about personal issues in his life? | Like if im having a rough day and i need to get it out. Or if i need female advice on another girl that im talking to.
trunksfreak	I dont know if anything like that is available in my area. I live in a small town in indiana
trunksfreak	Can you send me to a decent plan for a solid frugal budget? I forgot to mention i pay at least $30 in gas a week. It typically varies. I spend easily $50 a week on food if not more.
trunksfreak	Its not a car loan. Im literally paying for the car. Ive got around $900 left until its mine. I need the car to go back and forth to work.
trunksfreak	Im at my wits end and I desperately need advice to try and better myself. | I didnt know where else to go to, and I dont know where to really start. I currently make $9.30 per hour 40 hours a week and not allowed overtime. I pay my house's utilities (roughly $200/month), car insurance ($70/month), car payment ($240/month), internet ($60/month), phone ($50/month). I just learned that i wont be getting my tax return because i didnt have health insurance for 2016. I was expecting nearly $900 and I'll end up owing over $500 as a result of the penalty from ACA. I'm currently nearly $40k in student debt that i cant afford to pay. There are issues with my home that i cant afford to save money for, for example, my water heater is busted and i need a new one. I had planned on using my tqx check for that but obviously i wont be able to. Im trying desperately to better myself after a long period of severe depression and poverty. I dont know who to go to or what resources are at my disposal to try and get back on my own two feet. I also just recently found out that ny cheapest option for health insurance will be another $200/month. Im completely lost and cant seem to save money.
trunksfreak	I wholeheartedly agree with you. Today people expect you to be an expert at reading them. Minds cannot be read. Its just not possible. How can you expect to work on realtionships if you arent willing to openly communicate. We all have mouths and a brain to create speech. Speak up!
trunksfreak	I agree that a lot of these messages are bullshit. But think about it. What gets more of a reaction out of you? The crazy nasty ones or the messages that are legit and decent. Ive been on OKcupid so many times trying to be different in my messages, essentially reading their profile and picking something i like and starting a convo with that. Guess how many responses i got. Maybe 1 out of the 100 girls i messaged over time. And to make it more discouraging, the majority of messages i would get were from fake profiles looking for cash. Its incredibly hard for those of us that want a real friendship or relationship to keep going through the dating game. If you arent the most interesting man in the world, good luck.
trunksfreak	He seems as though he's telling you the god-honest truth. He feels as though your feelings would just result in him being a rebound and i can understand why he woukd deny you. At least right now. Take time to be single and find who you really are, and if you still hold these feelings for him later on, hit him up again.
trunksfreak	We live in a world right now that essentially punishes those of us who are genuine people. Especially in the dating world. We're all looking for Mr. Or miss perfect instead of thinking rationally and understanding that no one is perfect and that we all have these massive flaws. Too many people would rather put on a mask hoping to attract the best of the best instead of the being yourself and attracting most real people. Real love is hard to come by nowadays.
trunksfreak	I agree. I'm not the kind of guy who enjoys the whole act of dating. It's gotten so complicated and you have a certain mindset to be successful that it takes away from the phrase "just be yourself" . I mean I'm gonna be me whether you like it or not. I feel society has really perverted courtship. I missed the days when people really put effort and long term love into a relationship.
trunksfreak	This is what's wrong with the world today, instead of being honest about events in your life, the go to option is to obviously lie out your ass and hope people believe you and trust you. Trust is built on honesty and respect. Lies destroy relationships.
trunksfreak	I forget, what was the definition of irony again?
trunksfreak	I'm replaying this and my God this is so fucking true
trunksfreak	Is it me or does the thumbnail look like an older version of Nicholas Cage?
trunksfreak	This would be nice to have since I don't have one, so I'm putting in my bid
trunksfreak	I understand where you're coming from. The thing is, he and I trip very differently. He's very social while I am much more internal. Essentially when we triptogether, he forces me to do what he wants to do instead of letting me do my own thing. He's got this sort of control sort of thing over me that I refuse to let him take advantage of.
trunksfreak	I'm nearly 40k in debt because I went to college and it didn't work out. It has been a constant struggle since then.
trunksfreak	The thing is we were both tripping on shrooms for the first time.
trunksfreak	My best friend ruined my mushroom trip. | So I didn't necessarily have a bad trip, I just wasn't able to focus on the trip because he literally would not stop talking the entire experience. For like 6 hours he constantly talked with maybe a breath or two. I tried subtly letting him know that I wanted to listen to music and kinda delve deep into my mind but he wouldn't let me.
trunksfreak	I'm going to.
trunksfreak	If you respect him then tell him immediately.
trunksfreak	I gotta say you played that off beautifully. If it were me, 10/10 would totally date again!
trunksfreak	Welcome to Team Fortress 2 ladies and gents
trunksfreak	I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do. | [Whitley County, Indiana] I don't know if what I'm asking is even worth it cause I know there are plenty of people in worse situations then I, but I don't know where else to turn to. For the past 6 years I've been living with my disabled mother. I love her dearly but she has a horrible habit of never doing anything around the house and always complains about severe pain. She is also a cat hoarder. The house we live in is falling down around us. There is no heat or hot water. The cats have used all the litter. So there is feces and urine everywhere. I try to keep up with the litter boxes but I work and I feel ill almost everyday. It's hard to keep up with about 30 cats when your mother won't do a damn thing around the house while I'm at work all day. I rely on friends to let me take hot showers but because I don't want to be a burden, I only ever take a shower maybe once a week. She takes them less. I've struggled with severe depression as a result of living here, I've come close to attempting suicide but I never want to get to that point. I met a girl earlier this year, and for the first time I had the motivation to better myself. But it turned out she wanted nothing to do with me and its put me in a really bad place. My sister uses my car to go back and forth to work while I make payments on it. She doesn't help with the payments despite me almost begging her to help. I've become sour and mean these past few years because of my situation. I don't want to be. I've tried so hard to not ask for help, telling myself that I should be able to do it on my own but I just can't anymore. I'm cold, I'm depressed, I've practically lost my sense of smell due to the ammonia, the only times I can deal is when I'm out with my only friend, and recently I haven't been bothering him because he's found someone and I don't want to get in the way. I feel like no matter what I do, nothing ever makes a difference. I recently found a new job but it's only paying me 30cents more than I make now. I make sure all of my bills are paid on time. I have my electric, gas, Internet, car payment, insurance, gas for the car, etc. my mother gets SSI and uses roughly half of if for the cats. I don't know what else to do. I'm so desperate. Living in this house is like being homeless. And even with a full time job, I inly barely have enough to keep things the way they are. I don't even make enough to put into savings. 
trunksfreak	I know exactly what's wrong with the furnace. The cats have gotten INSIDE of the actual furnace because it's warm. Theyve torn down all of the piping leading to the vents upstairs. The furnace is ruined. There's no fixing it.

goramfed	you know pubg developers get 10% of steam market transaction.  Why would they remove one of their largest revenue streams. 
goramfed	In my job it's not uncommon to only wear blues for wing CoC and PME. I started a simiannual blues inspection for my troops. Typically on a Friday after PT, have them change into blues, if it's all good send them home before lunch.    This keeps you from the shiity situation of standing next to a guy after their dui in blues that look like ass. 
goramfed	Sell the items not the crates. 
goramfed	Why AFK bots won't get dealt with. | So something that is not common knowledge for those not using the steam marketplace often is there are two fees charged on every transaction.   There is a steam fee, a flat 5%;  and the game specific fee that goes to the developers, 10% for most games.   I did some calculations on the steam marketplace using just the top 6 items sold, the 3 types of crate, the key, and both parts of yellow jumpsuit.   in the 24 hours between 6pm and 6pm Fri the 8th to Sat the 9th Bluehole made $7200 in transaction fees. i'm sure the total is a lot more but I didn't want to do the math for every item. but at $7200/day thats an extra quarter million per month.     Thats what these bots help contribute to, the market economy is good for the developers. 
goramfed	This only happens when the bots are kicked out in water. no way to farm them.
goramfed	Good bot

goramfed	i went through in 2012 and only one person was going to opt out and the MTI pretty much told him no.  Its like they get kickbacks from signing kids up to sign away $1200.
goramfed	Its a new pretty round number for an ATH.  Why not.
goramfed	Agree, radar and airfield are dope. (Radar is better)
goramfed	27/50 wins are KO. wtf are you talking about. 
goramfed	Regicide
goramfed	They didn't legalize swords, they removed the restriction of 5.5inches (14cm) to be carried on a person.  This includes practical things like filet knives for fishing, skinning knives for hunting, and gardening knives.  There are plenty of situations where having a large knife holstered during your work or hobby would be more helpful then carried in a tool box, this law allows that, and by consequence allows swords too.
SuredyDo	Women of Reddit, what's something you notice about men that they think you don't notice? | 
SuredyDo	we see everything 
SuredyDo	How long is your commute to school? | I live in NYC and commute about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to school each way and people outside of New York find this crazy. Thoughts?  Edit: also how do you guys get to school? like by school bus, walk, bike, car, subway...?
SuredyDo	ooh yay someone who can relate  how do you get there?
SuredyDo	Do you take a bus?
SuredyDo	What method of transportation is that?
SuredyDo	I did end up taking this into consideration, which lead me to buy the 720 about two weeks ago. I don't believe it has Kaby Lake, but I don't think I really need it as I have been doing most of my gaming on my Mac instead (windows bootcamp). Thank you so much for the help!
SuredyDo	I ended up taking your advice and going for the Lenovo Yoga 720 13" 256 gb version about a week after my post. So far, it's been pretty much perfect! Thank you so much for the suggestion. 
SuredyDo	they weren't ready |

SuredyDo	Thank you so much for the suggestions! As for the Mac option, MapleStory isn't that important because I do have another laptop that I play it on. The only problem is that it's too heavy for me to carry around everyday. If I could get the new 12" MacBook for $875 before taxes, would that be comparable to the other options?
SuredyDo	Help finding a laptop for around $900 for school! [USA] | * **Total budget and country of purchase:**  Around $900, USA  * **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.**  I wouldn't mind a 2 in 1. Battery life should be at least 8 hours.  * **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Very important as I'll be carrying this to school every day. At most 4.5 lbs but even that's pushing it.   * **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**  Windows is preferred as Mac tends to be a bit pricey but either should do.  * **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  15" should be more than enough but I wouldn't mind at least 12".  * **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  Nah, mostly just Microsoft Office, Skype, and occasionally Photoshop.  * **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  I'm not really a gamer but I might occasionally be playing MapleStory. Just wouldn't want lag.   * **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**   Touch-screen is preferred but not required. Finger-print reader would be a plus. I would like it to have a fairly good webcam, but also not too important.   * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  Nope! I really just need a laptop that I can take notes on for school fairly easily. I would prefer that the laptop is either Apple, Microsoft, HP, or Lenovo, but also not that important. 
SuredyDo	Stephen Colbert has an interesting video bashing her new line https://youtu.be/Qg0HCStAYMA
SuredyDo	idk I mean if I really liked the guy I know I could look past it, just would never wear heels lmao 
SuredyDo	I'm 5' 3" so it's not really a problem since most dudes are taller  But it just looks kinda weird I guess  Also I like wearing heels most of the time so it just adds to it
SuredyDo	Tbh I wouldn't date a dude shorter than me

SuredyDo	yep that's what we've been doing since we started dating but recently idk what's been going on bc he's always busy. I was gonna break up with him but everyone's saying he's "going through some stuff" so I'm just gonna wait it out   that's trueee, but money = responsibility doesn't it? 
SuredyDo	yeah I mean I guess  It's just that everything that's happened in the last few weeks has been bittersweet like I got accepted into this summer program that I've been trying to get into for months, buttt I didn't get accepted for financial aid so it would be $6k and I officially have a summer job now but this means I can't go away for vacation anymore  Then there's also the fact that I haven't seen my boyfriend for a month despite us attending the same school  School is also really fucking stressful
SuredyDo	lalalala life sucks 
SuredyDo	this is honestly so true for years i had been thinking "all I need is a boyfriend and I'll be happy forever" now I've been in a relationship for months and though I do get those random moments of like extreme happiness, all it really did was heighten my insecurities 
SuredyDo	maybe it's just me but I find confidence super attractive in guys so I would never be able to look past all the self-deprecation 
SuredyDo	idk if it's just me but I find it kinda odd when guys compliment my makeup or clothes 
SuredyDo	how exactly did they reject you? like what did they say?

sorryimlate96	Boyfriends of Reddit, what are some things you'd like to be surprised with? | 
sorryimlate96	I've started doing the blow-job wake-up call, he loves it. Which is funny bc he usually HATES to be woken up for anything. 
sorryimlate96	Definitely trying this one
sorryimlate96	I tried something similar, but probably more like a [beer cake? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/rA6y2) 
sorryimlate96	He would love all of these things, will do for sure 
sorryimlate96	"Hold her [12/25] head underwater for 5 minutes" lol wut
sorryimlate96	I appreciate this so much
sorryimlate96	I've recently gotten back into reading as well. I've started the Jack Reacher books. The post positive thing for me is that I have been sleeping better. It relaxes the mind after a day full of screens. 
sorryimlate96	You can gather that from just meeting him? 
sorryimlate96	Why do they think it's part of the game to bash/harass the target each week? Dom, Jess, Cody, Elena, Mark...It's so hard to watch  and then seeing Alex, Christmas, & Paul not getting the edits they deserve that showcase how they're treating these people
sorryimlate96	I don't know how to respond to that
sorryimlate96	I can't handle Frankie and Raven in the same episode
sorryimlate96	Tried to beat my doors down with a baseball bat yelling  "I'm going to shut that damn dog up one way or another" I didn't own a dog at the time...
sorryimlate96	Context? I'm very interested to know how one gets to the point of "I should shit on the floor, that'll teach him"

AcidLicker	What's the most painful thing you've felt? | 
AcidLicker	Holy shit, I heard 10% of people who have cluster headaches kill themselves 
AcidLicker	That sounds like hell I hope they go away completely :(
AcidLicker	I'll keep this in mind next time I have pain and be thankful it's not as bad as this
AcidLicker	Sheesh
AcidLicker	I guess what I should've put was "Every joke is ruined if you have to explain it"
AcidLicker	A joke is never funny if you have to explain it | 
AcidLicker	Only one way to find out. 
AcidLicker	Already said why weed isn't an option right now 
AcidLicker	Revenge feels great doesn't it 
AcidLicker	I take 8 pills in 24 hours so I'm good, i would smoke weed but my moms completely against it only because it gets you high
AcidLicker	Like I said I already tried convincing her and she just says its drugs and that I'm heading down the wrong path in life if I wanna take Kratom smh 
AcidLicker	Help with pain | I got prescribed Tylenol 3 and I'm having severe pain and the T3's aren't cutting it. I'm thinking it's because they gave me fentanyl while doing my surgery so my tolerance for opioids has risen. Do I go back and ask for something stronger? Or do I take more than what it says on the label? (It says take 1-2 every 6 hours)
AcidLicker	I'm in Texas and under 21 so that's off the table. Although I did smoke it recreationally I wish my parents would understand and let me enjoy it a little. 
AcidLicker	Thank you, i was thinking of taking 3 instead but my mom got prescribed them too before and she said when she had really bad pain 1 would cut it and she thinks I'm taking the pills just because and that I have no pain. 1 also knocks her out where I take 2 and I'm no where near sleepy so I think maybe I'm more tolerant to pain and drugs. 
AcidLicker	Something similar happened to my buddy except it was a very close friend and he didn't get paid for the ounce he was selling. 
AcidLicker	Thank you I appreciate it, I will follow your advice and call them today :) have a good day!
AcidLicker	Just tried convincing her and she said its drugs and that I'm not gonna have pain for a long time smh
AcidLicker	Indeed, I'd rather take a natural pain reliever that will put me in a really good mood opposed to something that will fuck my liver up with some pain relief. 
AcidLicker	Trust me I would but my mom would rather feed me drugs than let me enjoy a natural herb. 
AcidLicker	Harvey flooded my entire city and I cut 2 fingers and had so much blood coming out I was just praying and praying. Now of course 2 fingers isn't going to make you bleed out but it was in the heat of the moment, finally after getting on a boat onto an ambulance I figured out I cut 1 tendon it's possible 2 were cut, damaged nerves in both of my fingers (can't feel anything in fingertips and wound) and I had to get 13 stitches. I'm getting surgery tomorrow to repair the nerves and tendon or two. 
AcidLicker	I'd buy a new house and invest 100k in the stock market

AcidLicker	My Bizarre Dream | I had a dream last night night that I took an edible and was throwing something away when I saw a shadow figure dart around me. I look and try to find it and just think of it as nothing. I'm walking down the hallway and I am hearing voices talk to me in my head, I think "oh god why did I do this?" As I hear the voices and such It seems as I'm metal and the wall is a magnet. I am trying to walk and am having a very hard time doing so it's like I'm glued to the wall, immediately after that I wake up.  TLDR: Took an edible in my dream, couldn't walk and i was hearing voices. 
AcidLicker	Agreed, I love booty I was just wondering why. 
AcidLicker	I have finally received the answer, thank you. 
AcidLicker	But there can be a women that's not that much overweight and have a big ass where a guy can be fat as fuck and have a small ass I don't get it 
AcidLicker	Being nice to people 
AcidLicker	Guy fucked up in parking lot | I just saw a really fucked up guy in a Burger King Parking lot and I wonder what he took his motor skills are impaired and the only thing he said to us was "hi" "sorry" I hope the guy gets home safe workers were outside and he's gone but the cops didn't show up

AcidLicker	1. 10 million in my bank account  2. New Tesla Model S 3. 10 vials on White Fluff   Thanks!!
AcidLicker	Nope no particular reason, but wooden floor seems kinda lame I'd call it something else
AcidLicker	Hmmm, now that you mention it I could go for some fried chicken right now. If it's not a burden could you also throw in some French prostitutes? I like to have variety.
AcidLicker	Laying them would be just perfect!! If a genie is granting me anything I want I'm gonna be nice right? And of course I left up votes :)

AcidLicker	Since my last comment was removed let me explain it further. Supreme is a brand that collaborates with other large brands like Louis Vuitton, Thrasher, Vans, and Jordan. Due to all of these collaborations Supreme gets a bigger name, note all of these collaborations are very limited. 2 huge brands make a limited product, it's going to sell very Fast and going to be resold for a higher price as well. It's also just a brand that makes you look cool in the eyes on teenagers.
